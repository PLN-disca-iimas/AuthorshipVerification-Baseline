'That movement again! Don't you want me to go on?'

'Let us stop.'

'Not unless he wishes it. Why are those words so important?
Does the message end there? Is any one working against you? Some one
antagonistic? Yes. Not one of ourselves surely? No. Is it any one we
know? Yes. Can I get the name in the usual way? Yes. Is the first letter
of this person's name A?--B?----'

'Is the second letter A?'

'FA. Fa----?'

'Is the word Father? Yes.'

'I had no intention--Should I go away, Grace?'

'Perhaps you had better, Robert.'

'I suppose it is because he is an unbeliever? He is not openly
antagonistic, is he?'

'I am afraid he is.' 

'But he must admit that we do get messages.'

'He says we think we do. He says they would not
want to communicate with us if they had such trivial things to say.'

'But we are only on the threshold, Don. This is just a beginning.'

'Didn't you hear, Mr. Don--"Love Bade Me Welcome"?'

'Does that strike you as important, Laura?'

'He said it was.'

'It might be very important to him, though we don't understand why.'

'I didn't mean to be antagonistic, Grace. I thought. I wasn't
thinking of it at all.'

'Not thinking of Dick, Robert? And it was only five months ago!'

'I'll go.'

'A boy wouldn't turn his father out. Ask him.'

'As to that--as to that----'

'I will ask him if you wish me to, Robert.'

'No, don't.'

'It can't worry you as you are a disbeliever.'

'No, but--I shouldn't like you to think that he sent me away.'

'He won't. Will he, Mrs. Don?'

'You see, Dick and I were not
very--no quarrel or anything of that sort--but I, I didn't much matter
to Dick. I'm too old, perhaps.'

'I won't ask him, Robert, if you would prefer me not to.'

'I'll go.'

'I'm afraid it is too late now. Do you want me to break off?'

'Yes. Do you send me your love, Dick? Yes. And to Laura? Yes. Shall I ask him----?'

'No, no, don't.'

'It would be all right, Don.'

'I don't know.'

'May I go to my room, Mrs. Don? I feel
I--should like to be alone.'

'Yes, yes, Laura dear. I shall come in and see you.'

'I think we must all want to be alone after such an evening.
I shall say good-night, Mrs. Don.'

'Same here. I go your way, Rogers, but you will find me a silent
companion. One doesn't want to talk ordinary things to-night. Rather
not. Thanks, awfully.'

'Good-night, Don. It's a pity, you know; a bit hard on your wife.'

'Good-night, Rogers. Good-night, Major.'

'Dick's fishing-rods.'

'I hope you don't mind my keeping them in the
studio, Robert. They are sacred things to me.'

'That's all right, Grace.'

'I think I shall go to Laura now.'

'Yes,'

'Poor child!'

'I'm afraid I hurt her.'

'Dick wouldn't have liked it--but Dick's gone. I suppose you will resume your evening paper!'

'Why not, Grace?'

'I suppose it is just that a son is so much more to a mother
than to a father.'

'I daresay.'

'How you can read about the war nowadays!'

'I'm not going to give in. I am so sorry I was
in the way, Grace. I wasn't scouting you, or anything of that sort. It's
just that I can't believe in it.'

'Ah, Robert, you would believe if Dick had been to you what he was
to me.'

'I don't know.'

'In a sense you may be glad that you don't miss him in the way I do.'
