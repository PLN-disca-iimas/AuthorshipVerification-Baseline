No back talk! Pictures or not, it's all the same mopin' and
lazin' in it. It's the bad luck I've been
havin' altogether this last year since your mother died. Who's to do
the work and look after Nora and Tom and yourself, if Eileen is bad
took and has to stay in her bed? I'll have to get Mrs. Brennan come
look after the house. That means money, too, and where's it to come
from? All that I've saved from slavin' and sweatin' in the sun with a
gang of lazy Dagoes'll be up the spout in no time. hat a
fool a man is to be raisin' a raft of children and him not a
millionaire! Mary, dear, it's a black
curse God put on me when he took your mother just when I needed her
most. What are you sniffin' at?

 I was thinking--of Mamma.

It's late you are with your tears, and her cold
in her grave for a year. Stop it, I'm tellin' you!

Ah, here you are, the lot of you. Shut that door
after you! What's the use in me spendin' money for coal if all you do
is to let the cold night in the room itself?

 Me and Tom had a race, Papa. I
beat him. 

 Slow poke!

You didn't beat me, neither!

I did, too!

You did not! You didn't play fair. You tripped me comin' up the
steps. Brick-top! Cheater!

You're a liar! You stumbled over your own big
feet, clumsy bones! And I beat you fair Didn't I, Papa?

You did, darlin', and fair, too. Sure it's you can beat the divil
himself!

See? Liar!

Did you get the plug for me I told
you?
