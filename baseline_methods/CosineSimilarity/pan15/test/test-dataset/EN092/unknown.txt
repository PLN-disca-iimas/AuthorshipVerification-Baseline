'Not I.'

'Young gentlemen, how disgraceful!'

'Harum-scarums!'

'Does he know about you two?'

'He often forgets, I'll tell him again. Grandfather, Barbara and
I have something to say to you. It's this.'

'I know--I know. There's nothing like it. I'm very glad, Barbara.'

'You see, dear, I've loved Billy boy since the days when he
tried to catch the bull-trout with a string and a bent pin, and I held
on to his pinafore to prevent his tumbling in. We used to play at school
at marrying and giving in marriage, and the girl who was my bridegroom
had always to take the name of Billy. "Do you, woman, take this man
Billy--" the clergyman in skirts began, and before I could answer
diffidently, some other girl was sure to shout, "I should rather think
she does."'

'Don't forget the ring, Billy. You know, when I was married I think I couldn't find the ring!'

'Were you married here, sir?'

'Yes, at the village church.'

'So were my father and mother.'

'I remember walking back with my wife and bringing her in here through the window. She kissed some of
the furniture.'

'I suppose you would like a grander affair, Barbara?'

'No, just the same.'

'I hoped you would say that.'

'But, Billy, I'm to have such a dream of a wedding gown.
Granny is going with me to London, to choose it'--laying her head on the
Colonel's shoulder--'if you can do without her for a day, dear.'

'I shall go with you, I couldn't trust you and granny to choose the gown.'

'You must often be pretty lonely, sir, when we are all out and
about enjoying ourselves.'

'They all say that. But that is the time when I'm not lonely,
Karl. It's then I see things most clearly--the past, I suppose. It all
comes crowding back to me--India, the Crimea, India again--and it's so
real, especially the people. They come and talk to me. I seem to see
them; I don't know they haven't been here, Billy, till your granny tells
me afterwards.'
'Yes, I know, I wonder where granny is.'

'It isn't often she leaves you for so long, dear.'

'She told me she had to go out, but I forget where. Oh, yes,
she has gone down to the village to a wedding.'

'A wedding?'

'It's curious how he harps on that.'

'She said to me to listen and I would hear the wedding bells.'

'Not to-day, dear.'

'Best not to worry him.'

'But granny says we should try to make things clear to him.'

'Was any one with granny when she said she was going to a wedding?'

'You were there, Barbara.'

'No, dear. He said that to me before. And something about a nurse.'

'She was there, too.'

'Any one else?'

'There was that soldier.'

'A soldier also!'

'Just those three.'

'But that makes four. Granny and Barbara and a nurse and a soldier.'

'They were all there; but there were only three.'

'Odd.'

'Never mind, dear, Granny will make it all right.
She is the one for you.'

'She is the one for me.'

'If there had been a wedding, wouldn't she have taken the Colonel with her?'

'Of course she would.'

'You are not too old to have a kind eye for a wedding, sir.'

'Aha, aha! You know, if I had gone, very
likely I should have kissed the bride. Brides look so pretty on their
wedding day. They are often not pretty at other times, but they are all
pretty on their wedding day.'
'You have an eye for a pretty girl still, sir!'

'Yes, I have; yes, I have!'

'I do believe I see it all. Granny has been talking to you
about Billy boy and me, and you haven't been able to wait; you have
hurried on the wedding!'

'Bravo, Barbara, you've got it.'

'That may be it. Because I am sure you were to be there, Barbara.'

'Our wedding, Billy!'

'It doesn't explain those other people, though.'

'What is it, dear?'

'I can't quite remember, but I think that is why she didn't
take me. It is your wedding, Barbara, but I don't think Billy boy is to
be there, my love.'

'Not at my wedding!'

'Grandfather!'

'There's something sad about it.'

'There can't be anything sad about a wedding, dear. Granny
didn't say it was a sad wedding, did she?'

'She was smiling.'

'Of course she was.'

'But I think that was only to please the nurse.'

'That nurse again! Dear, don't think any more about it. There's
no wedding.'

'Is there not?'

'I told you! There is a wedding!'

'It's Barbara's wedding. Billy boy, why are you not at Barbara's
wedding?'
