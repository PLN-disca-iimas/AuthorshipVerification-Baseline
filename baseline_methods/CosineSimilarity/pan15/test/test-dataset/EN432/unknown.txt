I never killed my father. I'd be afeard to do that, except I was the like of yourself
with blind rages tearing me within, for I'm thinking you should have had
great tussling when the end was come.

We had not then. It was a hard woman was come
over the hill, and if he was always a crusty kind when he'd a hard woman
setting him on, not the divil himself or his four fathers could put up
with him at all.

And isn't it a great wonder that one wasn't fearing you?

Up to the day I killed my father, there wasn't a person in Ireland knew the kind I was, and I there
drinking, waking, eating, sleeping, a quiet, simple poor fellow with no
man giving me heed.

It was the girls were giving you heed maybe, and I'm thinking
it's most conceit you'd have to be gaming with their like.

Not the girls itself, and I won't tell you a lie. There wasn't anyone heeding me in that place
saving only the dumb beasts of the field.

And I thinking you should have been living the like of a king of Norway or the Eastern world. 

The like of a king, is it? And I after toiling, moiling, digging, dodging from the dawn till dusk with never a sight of joy or sport saving only when I'd be abroad in the dark
night poaching rabbits on hills, for I was a devil to poach, God forgive
me, and I near got six months for going with a dung fork
and stabbing a fish.

And it's that you'd call sport, is it, to be abroad in the
darkness with yourself alone?

I did, God help me, and there I'd be as happy as the sunshine
of St. Martin's Day, watching the light passing the north or the patches
of fog, till I'd hear a rabbit starting to screech and I'd go running in
the furze.
