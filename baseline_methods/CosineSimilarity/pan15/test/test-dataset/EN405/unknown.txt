Maw, suppose they won't let us in the Sunday School at all,
at all. We don't belong to that Sunday School. What'll we do then?

Indade they'll not turn yeez away on Christmas Eve. I
chose that Sunday School for yeez to attend because it's the largest
and the most fashionable in town. Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes there,
and wherever Mrs. Beverly Brewster goes, sure yeez can count on it,
it's bound to be most fashionable and select.

 But we never went there before. They'll think it's awfully
nervy fer us to come buttin' in at their Christmas entertainment.

 Niver once will they. They'll welcome yeez with open
arms and many Christmas prisints. And whatever yeez get be sure and
say, "Thank yeez kindly and much obliged." Can ye do that?

Oh, yes, mum.

Clarissa, look out'n the door and see if ye see
anything of Matsy and the goat.

Yes, mum.

Mary Ann Mulligan, quit fooling with yer sash. If I've
told yer once I've told yer a hundred times it's liable to bust and
yer skirt and yer waist ain't on speakin' terms.

Maw, here comes Mrs. O'Toole.

It's the goat. He's been filling himself up on the
O'Toole cabbages. My, my, that goat'll be the death of me yet.



Good evening, Mrs. Mulligan.

The same to ye, Mrs. O'Toole. Come in and set down.

I have no time to set down, and I have no inclination to
set down. And it's all on account of yer goat, Shamus O'Brien.

 Me goat, is it?

 It is the same, and it's an injured woman I am this
night.

My, my! I'll have to kill that old goat. He's entirely
too obstreperous. And did he chase you, Mrs. O'Toole?
