Three weeks of your days might
be long, surely, yet seven years are a short
space for the like of Naisi and myself.

If they're a short
space there aren't many the like of you.
Wasn't there a queen in Tara had to walk out
every morning till she'd meet a stranger and
see the flame of courtship leaping up within
his eye?  Tell me now,
are you well pleased that length with the same
man snorting next you at the dawn of day?

Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw-
ing light across the branches at the dawn of
day?  It's a heartbreak to the wise that it's for
a short space we have the same things only.
Yet the earth itself is a
silly place, maybe, when a man's a fool and
talker.

Well, go, take your
choice.  Stay here and rot with Naisi or go to
Conchubor in Emain.  Conchubor's a wrinkled
fool with a swelling belly on him, and eyes
falling downward from his shining crown;
Naisi should be stale and weary.  Yet there
are many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you I'd
liefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than living
on without a touch of kindness from your eyes
and voice.  It's a poor thing to be so lonesome
you'd squeeze kisses on a cur dog's nose.

Are there no women like
yourself could be your friends in Emain?

There are none like you, Deirdre.  It's for that I'm asking are
you going back this night with Fergus?

I will go where Naisi chooses.

It's Naisi, Naisi, is it?  Then, I tell you, you'll
have great sport one day seeing Naisi getting
a harshness in his two sheep's eyes and he
looking on yourself.  Would you credit it, my
father used to be in the broom and heather
kissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirping
out above their heads, and now she'd scare a
raven from a carcase on a hill.  Queens
get old, Deirdre, with their white and long
arms going from them, and their backs hooping.  I tell you it's a poor thing to see a queen's
nose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.

I'll go so, for if I had you seven
years I'd be jealous of the midges and the dust
is in the air.  I'll give
you a riddle, Deirdre: Why isn't my father as
ugly and old as Conchubor?  You've no
answer? . . . .  It's because Naisi killed him.
Think of that
and you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor-
ing, or the night you hear strange stories of
the things I'm doing in Alban or in Ulster
either.

Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.

He is welcome.  Let you rest, Fergus, you should be
hot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.

It's a sunny nook you've found
in Alban; yet any man would be well pleased
mounting higher rocks to fetch yourself and
Naisi back to Emain.

They've answered?  They would go?

They have not, but when I was a young man we'd have given
a lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks;
and to this day the old men have nothing so
heavy as knowing it's in a short while they'll
lose the high skies are over Ireland, and the
lonesome mornings with birds crying on the
bogs.  Let you come this day, for there's no
place but Ireland where the Gael can have
peace always.
It's true, surely.  Yet
we're better this place while Conchubor's in
Emain Macha.

There are your sureties and Conchubor's seal.
I am your surety with Conchubor.  You'll not be young always, and it's
time you were making yourselves ready for
the years will come, building up a homely dun
beside the seas of Ireland, and getting in your
children from the princes' wives.  It's little
joy wandering till age is on you and your
youth is gone away, so you'd best come this
night, for you'd have great pleasure putting
out your foot and saying, "I am in Ireland,
surely."

It isn't pleasure I'd have while Conchubor is king in Emain.

Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and the
kings of Meath? It's easy being fearful and you alone
in the woods, yet it would be a poor thing if
a timid woman could
turn away the Sons of Usna from the life of
kings.  Let you be thinking on the years to
come, Deirdre, and the way you'd have a right
to see Naisi a high and white-haired justice
beside some king of Emain.  Wouldn't it be a
poor story if a queen the like of you should
have no thought but to be scraping up her
hours dallying in the sunshine with the sons of
kings?

I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet you'd do well,
Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sake
of your own years, so you'll not be saying till
your hour of death, maybe, it was yourself
brought Naisi and his brothers to a grave was
scooped by treachery.  

It is a poor thing to see a
queen so lonesome and afraid. 
Listen now to what I'm saying.  You'd do well
to come back to men and women are your
match and comrades, and not be lingering
until the day that you'll grow weary, and hurt
Deirdre showing her the hardness will grow
up within your eyes. . . .  You're here years
and plenty to know it's truth I'm saying.
