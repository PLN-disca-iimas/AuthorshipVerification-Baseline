  
            Do not give way to this uncalled-for grief,
            Your separation will be very brief.
                 To ascertain which is the King
                      And which the other,
                 To Barataria's Court I'll bring
                      His foster-mother;
                 Her former nurseling to declare
                      She'll be delighted.
            That settled, let each happy pair
                 Be reunited.
		Viva!  His argument is strong!
 		Viva!  We'll not be parted long!
                 Viva!  It will be settled soon!
                 Viva!  Then comes our honeymoon!

                                                    

	           Then one of us will be a Queen,
                      And sit on a golden throne,
                           With a crown instead
                           Of a hat on her head,
                      And diamonds all her own!
                 With a beautiful robe of gold and green,
                      I've always understood;
                           I wonder whether
                           She'd wear a feather?
                      I rather think she should!

	          Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween,
                 To be a regular Royal Queen!
                 No half-and-half affair, I mean,
                 But a right-down regular Royal Queen!

	           She'll drive about in a carriage and pair,
                      With the King on her left-hand side,
                           And a milk-white horse,
                           As a matter of course,
                      Whenever she wants to ride!
                 With beautiful silver shoes to wear
                      Upon her dainty feet;
                           With endless stocks
                           Of beautiful frocks
                      And as much as she wants to eat!

	         Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween, etc.

	         Whenever she condescends to walk,
                      Be sure she'll shine at that,
                           With her haughty stare
                           And her nose in the air,
                      Like a well-born aristocrat!
                 At elegant high society talk
                      She'll bear away the bell,
                           With her "How de do?"
                           And her "How are you?"
                      And "I trust I see you well!"

  ALL.           Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween, etc.

  GIU.           And noble lords will scrape and bow,
                      And double themselves in two,
                           And open their eyes
                           In blank surprise
                      At whatever she likes to do.
                 And everybody will roundly vow
                      She's fair as flowers in May,
