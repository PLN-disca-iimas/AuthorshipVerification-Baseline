Funny! I do feel sort of--nutty,
to-night. I feel old.

Old?

Sure--like I'd been living a long, long time--out here in the
fog.  I don't know how to tell you yust what I
mean. It's like I'd come home after a long visit away some place. It
all seems like I'd been here before lots of times--on boats--in this
same fog. You must think I'm off my base.

Anybody feel funny dat vay in fog.

But why d'you s'pose I feel so--so--like I'd
found something I'd missed and been looking for--'s if this was the
right place for me to fit in? And I seem to have forgot--everything
that's happened--like it didn't matter no more. And I feel clean,
somehow--like you feel yust after you've took a bath. And I feel happy
for once--yes, honest!--happier than I ever been anywhere before! 
It's nutty for me to feel that way, don't you think?

Ay tank Ay'm damn fool for

You talk--nutty to-night yourself. You
act's if you was scared something was going to happen.

CHRIS--Only God know dat, Anna.

Then it'll be Gawd's will, like the preachers
say-what does happen.
