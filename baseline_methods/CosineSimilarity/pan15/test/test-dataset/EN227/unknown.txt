hand to stay you at all?

Stranger.

Whisht, whisht. Be quiet I'm telling you, they're coming now at the door.

I wasn't long at all, stranger, for I met himself on the path.

You were middling long, lady of the house.

There was no sign from himself?

No sign at all, lady of the house.

Go over now and pull down the sheet, and look on
himself, Micheal Dara, and you'll see it's the truth I'm telling you.

I will not, Nora, I do be afeard of the dead.

 Will you drink a sup of tea with myself and the
young man, stranger, or will you go into
the little room and stretch yourself a short while on the bed, I'm
thinking it's destroyed you are walking the length of that way in the
great rain.

Is it to go away and leave you, and you having a wake, lady of the
house? I will not surely. And it's none of your tea I'm asking either.

That's a poor coat you have, God help you, and I'm thinking it's a poor
tailor you are with it.

If it's a poor tailor I am, I'm thinking it's a poor herd does be
running back and forward after a little handful of ewes the way I seen
yourself running this day, young fellow, and you coming from the fair.

Let you not mind him at all, Micheal Dara, he has a drop taken and it's soon he'll be falling asleep.

It's no lie he's telling, I was destroyed surely. They were that
wilful they were running off into one man's bit of oats, and another
man's bit of hay, and tumbling into the red bogs till it's more like a
pack of old goats than sheep they were. Mountain ewes is a queer breed,
Nora Burke, and I'm not used to them at all.
