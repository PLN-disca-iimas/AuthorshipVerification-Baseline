He's a hog on two legs.

You bet! I hope to get Eileen away from all this as soon as--things pick
up a little. Eileen and I have gone around together for years--went to
Grammar and High School together--in different classes, of course.
She's really a corker--very different from the rest of the family
you've seen--like her mother. She's really educated and knows a
lot--used to carry off all the prizes at school. My folks like her
awfully well. Of course, they'd never stand for--him.

You'll excuse my curiosity--I've a good reason for it--but you
and Miss Carmody are engaged, aren't you? Carmody said you were.


Why, yes, in a way--but nothing definite--no
official announcement or anything of that kind. It's all in the future.
We have to wait, you know.  We've been
sort of engaged for years, you might say. It's always been sort of
understood between us. 

Then I can be frank with you. I'd like to be
because I may need your help. I don't put much faith in any promise
Carmody makes. Besides, you're bound to know anyway. She'd tell you.

Is it--about her sickness?

Yes.

 Then--it's serious?

It's pulmonary tuberculosis--consumption.

Consumption? Good heavens! Are you sure, Doctor?

Positive. It's had a good start--thanks to her father's blind
selfishness--but let's hope that can be overcome. The important thing
is to ship her off to a sanatorium immediately. Carmody wouldn't hear
of it at first. However, I managed to bully him into consenting; but I
don't trust his word. That's where you can be of help. It's up to you
to convince him that it's imperative she be sent away at once--for the
safety of those around her as well as her own.
