I'll do it, Annie--for
your sake--if you say it's needful for ye.

God bless you for that,
David!

 The ice is breakin' up to no'the'ard, sir. There's a
clear passage through the floe, and clear water beyond, the lookout
says.

A clear passage? To
no'the'ard?

Yes, sir.

Then get her
ready and we'll drive her through.

Aye, aye, sir.

David! David!

Will the men turn to willin' or must we drag
'em out?

They'll turn to willin' enough. You put the fear o' God into 'em,
sir. They're meek as lambs.

KEENEY. Then drive 'em--both watches. [_With grim determination._]
They's whale t'other side o' this floe and we're agoin' to git 'em.

MATE. Aye, aye, sir.

And I was agoin' home
like a yaller dog!

David!

Woman, you ain't adoin' right when you meddle in
men's business and weaken 'em. You can't know my feelin's. I got to
prove a man to be a good husband for ye to take pride in. I got to git
the ile, I tell ye.
David! Aren't you going home?

You ain't well. Go and
lay down a mite. I got to git on deck.

David!

Woman, what foolish mockin' is this? Annie! What is it? Don't you know me, Annie?

You said--you was agoin' mad--God!

Whales, sir--a whole school of 'em--off
the star-b'd quarter 'bout five miles away--big ones!

Are you lowerin' the boats?

MATE. Yes, sir.

I'm acomin' with ye.

MATE. Aye, aye, sir. You'll git the ile now right
enough, sir.

Annie! Did you hear him? I'll git the
ile. [I know you're foolin' me, Annie. You
ain't out of your mind--be you? I'll git the ile now
right enough--jest a little while longer, Annie--then we'll turn
home'ard. I can't turn back now, you see that, don't you? I've got to
git the ile. Answer me! You ain't mad, be you?

All ready, sir.

Comin', sir?
