Here's health, then,
to herself and you!

Here's to the years when you
were young as she!

Naisi!

This is the High King's. . . .  I see his mark
on the rim.  Does Conchubor come lodging
here?

Who says it's Conchubor's?  How dare young fools the like of you
-- come prying around, running the world into troubles
for some slip of a girl?  What brings you this
place straying from Emain? Though you think, maybe, young men can do
their fill of foolery and there is none to blame them.

Is the rain easing?

The clouds are breaking. . . .
I can see Orion in the gap of the glen.

Open the door
and we'll go forward to the little cabin between
the ash-tree and the rocks.  Lift the bolt and
pull it.

Naisi!  Do not leave me,
Naisi.  I am Deirdre of the Sorrows.

And it is you who go around in the woods
making the thrushes bear a grudge against the
heavens for the sweetness of your voice
singing.

It is with me you've spoken,
surely.  Take Ainnle and Ardan, these two princes,
into the little hut where we eat, and serve them
with what is best and sweetest.  I have many
thing for Naisi only.

I will do it, and I ask their pardon.  I have
fooled them here.

Do not take it badly that I am asking you to walk
into our hut for a little.  You will have a
supper that is cooked by the cook of Conchubor, and Lavarcham will tell you stories of
Maeve and Nessa and Rogh.

We'll ask Lavarcham to tell us
stories of yourself, and with that we'll be well
pleased to be doing your wish.

Come to this stool, Naisi.  If it's low itself the High
King would sooner be on it this night than on
the throne of Emain Macha.

You are Fedlimid's daughter that Conchubor has walled up
from all the men of Ulster.

Do many know what is foretold, that Deirdre will be the ruin of the Sons
of Usna, and have a little grave by herself,
and a story will be told for ever?

It's a long while men have been
talking of Deirdre, the child who had all gifts,
and the beauty that has no equal; there are
many know it, and there are kings would give
a great price to be in my place this night and
you grown to a queen.

It isn't many I'd call, Naisi.
. . .  I was in the woods at the full moon
and I heard a voice singing.  Then I gathered
up my skirts, and I ran on a little path I have
to the verge of a rock, and I saw you pass by
underneath, in your crimson cloak, singing a
song, and you standing out beyond your
brothers are called the Plower of Ireland.It's for that you called us in the dusk?

Since that, Naisi, I have been one time the like of a ewe
looking for a lamb that had been taken away
from her, and one time seeing new gold on
the stars, and a new face on the moon, and all
times dreading Emain.

Yet it should be a lonesome thing to be in this place and you
born for great company.

This night I have
the best company in the whole world.

It is I who have the best company, for when you're
queen in Emain you will have none to be your
match or fellow.

I will not be queen in Emain.

Conchubor has made an oath you will, surely.

It's for that maybe I'm called
Deirdre, the girl of many sorrows . . . for
it's a sweet life you and I could have, Naisi.
. . . .  It should be a sweet thing to have
what is best and richest, if it's for a short
space only.

And we've a short space only to be triumphant and brave.

You must not go, Naisi, and
leave me to the High King, a man is aging
in his dun, with his crowds round him, and
his silver and gold.  I will
not live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldn't
we do well paying, Naisi, with silence and a
near death. I'm a long while in the woods
with my own self, and I'm in little dread of
death, and it earned with riches would make
the sun red with envy, and he going up the
heavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, and
she wasting away. Isn't it a
small thing is foretold about the ruin of our-
selves, Naisi, when all men have age coming
and great ruin in the end?
