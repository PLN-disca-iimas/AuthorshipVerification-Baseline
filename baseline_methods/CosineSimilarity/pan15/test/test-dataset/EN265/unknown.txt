The tide, Crichton, is a postman who
calls at our island twice a day for letters.

Thank you, sir.

Poor Crichton! I sometimes think he is losing his sense of
humour. Come along, Agatha.

How horribly still it is.

It is best when it is still.

Mary, I have heard that they are
always very still just before they jump.

Don't.

It is only Crichton knocking down
trees.

Mary, let us go and stand beside him.

Let a servant see that I am afraid!

Don't, then; but remember this, dear, they often drop on one
from above.

Crichton, Crichton!

Did you call, my lady?

I! Why should I?

I made a mistake, your ladyship. If you are
afraid of being alone, my lady--

Afraid! Certainly not. You may go.

I wish, Crichton, you could work without getting so hot.

I wish I could, my lady.

It makes me hot to look at you.

It almost makes me cool to look at your ladyship.

Anything I can do for
you in that way, Crichton, I shall do with pleasure.

Thank you, my lady.

Don't give way, my lady, things might be worse.

My poor father.

If I could have given my life for his.

You did all a man could do. Indeed I thank you, Crichton. You are a man.

Thank you, my lady.

But it is all so awful. Crichton, is there any hope of a ship
coming?

Of course there is, my lady.

Don't treat me as a child. I have got to
know the worst, and to face it. Crichton, the truth.

We were driven out of our course, my lady; I
fear far from the track of commerce.

Thank you; I understand.

You're a good pluckt 'un, my lady.

I shall try to be. Crichton, how dare you?

I beg your ladyship's pardon; but you are.

And until a ship comes we are three men who are going to do our best for
you ladies.

Mr. Ernest does no work.

But he will, my lady.

I doubt it.

No work--no dinner--will make a great change in Mr. Ernest.

No work--no dinner. When did you invent that rule, Crichton?

I didn't invent it, my lady. I seem to
see it growing all over the island.

Crichton, your manner strikes me as curious.

I hope not, your ladyship.

You are not implying
anything so unnatural, I presume, as that if I and my sisters don't work
there will be no dinner for us?

If it is unnatural, my lady, that is the end of it.

If? Now I understand. The perfect servant at home holds that
we are all equal now. I see.

My lady, can you think me so
inconsistent?

That is it.

My lady, I disbelieved in equality at home because
it was against nature, and for that same reason I as utterly disbelieve
in it on an island.

I apologise.

There must always, my lady, be one
to command and others to obey.

One to command, others to obey. Yes. Crichton!

What is it, my lady?

Look what I found.

Cocoa-nuts. Bravo!

They grows on trees.

Where did you think they grew?

I thought as how they grew in rows on top of little sticks.
