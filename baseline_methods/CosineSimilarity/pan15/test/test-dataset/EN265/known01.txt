Yes, Tomasso, tell
us the secret; we'll never tell anyone.

 Sure we won't. Nice Tomasso, tell us vot it is yet.

Well, I----

Now, you tell _me_,
Tomasso. I never tell any secrets at all, at all.

Well, I----

If you're going to tell it, I want
to hear every word. I never want to miss noddings no times.

 Neither do I.

Neither do I.

 Neither do any of us.

 I don't want to miss nothing neither.

 No, und I don't neither.

 Now, what is the secret, Tomasso?

 It is not my secret. It is Anita's secret.

Well, what is Anita's secret.

She wouldn't tell me.

 Oh!

She's promised to tell us all in the morning. She said that
would be her Christmas present to us--to tell us the secret. 

It seems so strange to spend Christmas Eve away out here in
the middle of the ocean.

Wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as Santa
Claus comes.

Sure I think the Sandman has been after spillin'
sand in all of our eyes. I'm that sleepy I can't say a word at all, at
all.

They're putting out all the lights. Here, Sergius, hang my
little lantern in front of the candle.

Allee samee hang mine. 

I'm going to stretch out here and take a little nap.
Be sure and wake me up, Hulda, just as soon as
you hear the bells on his reindeer.

I wonder what has become of Anita?

 I believe I'm getting sleepy, too.

 So are all of us.

We're all noddin', nid, nid noddin', sure I think it's
time we were all of us fast asleep.
