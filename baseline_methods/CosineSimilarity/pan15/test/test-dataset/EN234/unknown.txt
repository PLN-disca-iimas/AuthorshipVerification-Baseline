'That's better,'

'I think I'll go to my room now. You will come up, mater?'

'Yes, dear. I shan't be five minutes, John.'

'More like half an hour.'

'There is nothing wrong, is there? I thought I noticed a--a----'

'A certain liveliness, my dear. No, we were only having a good talk.'

'What about, John?'

'About the war,'

'About tactics and strategy, wasn't it, Roger?'

'Yes.'

'The fact is, Ellen, I have been helping Roger to take his first
trench.' With a big breath, 'And we took it too, together, didn't we,
Roger?'

'You bet,'

'Though I suppose,' sighing, 'it is one of those trenches that the enemy
retake during the night.'

'Oh, I--I don't know, father.'

'Whatever are you two talking about?'

'Aha, it is very private. We don't tell you everything, you know, Ellen.'

'Come on, mater, it's only his beastly sarcasm again. 'Night, father; I
won't see you in the morning.'

''Night,'

'Good-night, dear father.'

'A beautiful morning, Dering.'

'Too much sun, sir. The roses be complaining, and, to make matters
worse, Miss Barbara has been watering of them--in the heat of the day.'

'Has she? She means well. Dering, you heard it, didn't you?' 

'What was that, sir?'

'The thunderstorm--early this morning.'

'There was no thunderstorm, sir.'

'That is what they all say. It was at four o'clock. I
got up and looked out at the window. The evening primroses were very
beautiful.'

'I don't hold much with evening primroses,
sir; but I was out and about at four; there was no thunderstorm.'

'I suppose I just thought there was one. Perhaps it was
some thunderstorm of long ago that I heard. They do come back, you
know.'

'Do they, sir?'

'I am glad to see you moving about in the garden, Dering, with
everything just as usual.'

'Thank you, sir.'

'No, don't go. I am--a little troubled, Dering.'

'Everything be all right, sir.'

'I'm glad of that,' the Colonel says with relief. 'It is pleasant to see
that you have come back, Dering. Why did you go away for such a long
time?'

'Me, sir?' Dering is a little aggrieved. 'I haven't had a day off since
Christmas.'

'Haven't you? I thought--'

'Is everything just as usual, Dering?'

'Yes, sir. There never were a place less changed than this.'

'That's true.' The Colonel is appeased. 'Thank you, Dering, for saying
that.' But next moment he has lowered his voice again. 'Dering, there is
nothing wrong, is there? Is anything happening that I am not being told
about?'

'Not that I know of, sir.'

'That is what they all say, but--I don't know. Dering, I feel as if I was needed
somewhere. I don't know where it is. No one will tell me. Where is every
one?'

'They're all about, sir. There's a cricket match on at the village green.'

'Is there?'

'If the wind had a bit of south in it you could hear their voices. You
were a bit of a nailer at cricket yourself, sir.'

'Ninety-nine against Mallowfield, and then bowled off my pads. Biggest
score I ever made. Mallowfield wanted to add one to make it the hundred,
but I wouldn't let them. I was pretty good at steering them through the
slips, Dering! Do you remember my late cut? It didn't matter where point
stood, I got past him. You used to stand at point, Dering.'

'That was my grandfather, sir. If he was to be believed, he used to snap
you regular at point.'

'Did he? I daresay he did. I can't play now, but I like to watch it still.' 
'Dering, there is no cricket on the green to-day. I have been down to look. I don't understand it, Dering. When I
got there the green was all dotted with them--it's the prettiest sight
and sound in England. But as I watched them they began to go away, one
and two at a time; they weren't given out, you know, they went as if
they had been called away. Some of the little shavers stayed on--and
then they went off, as if they had been called away too. The stumps were
left lying about. Why is it?'

'It's just fancy, sir, I saw Master Will oiling his bat yesterday.'
