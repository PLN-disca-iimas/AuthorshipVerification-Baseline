You wouldn't find your way, stranger, for there's a small path
only, and it running up between two sluigs where an ass and cart would
be drowned. Let you be making yourself
easy, and saying a prayer for his soul, and it's not long I'll be coming
again.

Maybe if you'd a piece of a grey thread and a
sharp needle--there's great safety in a needle, lady of the house--I'ld
be putting a little stitch here and there in my old coat, the time I'll
be praying for his soul, and it going up naked to the saints of God.

There's the needle, stranger, and I'm thinking you won't be
lonesome, and you used to the back hills, for isn't a dead man itself
more company than to be sitting alone, and hearing the winds crying, and
you not knowing on what thing your mind would stay?

It's true, surely, and the Lord have mercy on us all!

Don't be afeard, stranger; a man that's dead can do no hurt.

I meant no harm, your honour; and won't you leave me
easy to be saying a little prayer for your soul?


Ah, the devil mend her.... Do you hear that, stranger? Did ever you hear another woman
could whistle the like of that with two fingers in her mouth?I'm destroyed with the drouth, and let you bring me a drop quickly before herself will come back.

Is it not dead you are?

How would I be dead, and I as dry as a baked bone, stranger?

 What will herself say if she smells the stuff on you, for I'm thinking it's not for nothing you're letting on to be dead?
