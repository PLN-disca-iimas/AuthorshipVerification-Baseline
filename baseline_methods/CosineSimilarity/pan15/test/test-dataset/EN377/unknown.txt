 Good evening to you, lady of the house.

Good evening, kindly stranger, it's a wild night, God help you, to be
out in the rain falling.

It is, surely, and I walking to Brittas from the Aughrim fair.

 Is it walking on your feet, stranger?

On my two feet, lady of the house, and when I saw the light below
I thought maybe if you'd a sup of new milk and a quiet decent corner
where a man could sleep {he looks in past her and sees the dead man.}
The Lord have mercy on us all!

It doesn't matter anyway, stranger, come in out of the rain.

Is it departed he is?

It is, stranger. He's after dying on me, God forgive him, and there
I am now with a hundred sheep beyond on the hills, and no turf drawn for
the winter.

It's a queer look is on him for a man that's dead.

He was always queer, stranger, and I suppose
them that's queer and they living men will be queer bodies after.

Isn't it a great wonder you're letting him lie there, and he is
not tidied, or laid out itself?

I was afeard, stranger, for he put a black
curse on me this morning if I'ld touch his body the time he'ld die
sudden, or let any one touch it except his sister only, and it's ten
miles away she lives in the big glen over the hill.

It's a queer story he wouldn't let his own wife touch him, and he dying quiet in his bed.

He was an old man, and an odd man, stranger, and it's always up on
the hills he was thinking thoughts in the dark mist. Lay your hand on him now, and tell me if it's cold he is surely.
