'You don't show it.'

'That is because of our awkward relationship.'

'We have got to go through with it.'

'There's no way out.'

'No.'

'We have, as it were, signed a compact, Roger, never to let on that we
care for each other. As gentlemen we must stick to it.'

'Yes. What are you getting at, father?'

'There is a war on, Roger.'

'That needn't make any difference.'

'Yes, it does. Roger, be ready; I hate to hit you without warning. I'm
going to cast a grenade into the middle of you. It's this, I'm fond of
you, my boy.'

'Father, if any one were to hear you!'

'They won't. The door is shut, Amy is gone to bed, and all is quiet in
our street. Won't you--won't you say something civil to me in return,
Roger?'

'I sometimes--bragged about you at school.'

'Did you? What sort of things, Roger?'

'I--I forget.'

'Come on, Roger.'

'Is this fair, father?'

'No, I suppose it isn't.' Mr. Torrance attacks the coals again. 'You and
your mother have lots of confidences, haven't you?'

'I tell her a good deal. Somehow--'

'Yes, somehow one can.' With the artfulness that comes of years, 'I'm
glad you tell her everything.'

'Not everything, father. There are things--about oneself--'

'Aren't there, Roger!'

'Best not to tell her.'

'Yes--yes. If there are any of them you would care to tell me
instead--just if you want to, mind--just if you are in a hole or
anything?'

'No thanks,'
'Any little debts, for instance?'

'That's all right now. Mother--'

'She did?'

'I was willing to speak to you about them, but--'

'She said, "Not worth while bothering father."'

'How did you know?'

'Oh, I have met your mother before, you see. Nothing else?'

'No.'

'Haven't been an ass about a girl or anything of that sort?''

'Good lord, father!'

'I shouldn't have said it. In my young days we sometimes--It's all
different now.'

'I don't know, I could tell you things that would surprise you.'

'No! Not about yourself?'

'No. At least--'

'Just as you like, Roger.'

'It blew over long ago.'

'Then there's no need?'

'No--oh no. It was just--you know--the old, old story.'

'I see. It hasn't--left you bitter about the sex, Roger, I hope?'

'Not now. She--you know what women are.'

'Yes, yes.'

'You needn't mention it to mother.'

'I won't. Think your mother and I are an aged pair, Roger?'

'I never--of course you are not young.'

'How long have you known that? I mean, it's true--but I didn't know it
till quite lately.'

'That you're old?'
'Hang it, Roger, not so bad as that--elderly. This will stagger you; but
I assure you that until the other day I jogged along thinking of myself
as on the whole still one of the juveniles. I
crossed the bridge, Roger, without knowing it.'

'What made you know?'

'What makes us know all the new things, Roger?--the war. I'll tell you
a secret. When we realised in August of 1914 that myriads of us were to
be needed, my first thought wasn't that I had a son, but that I must get
fit myself.'

'You!'

'Funny, isn't it? But, as I tell you,
I didn't know I had ceased to be young, I went into Regent's Park and
tried to run a mile.'

'Lummy, you might have killed yourself.'

'I nearly did--especially as I had put a weight on my shoulders to
represent my kit. I kept at it for a week, but I knew the game was up.
The discovery was pretty grim, Roger.'

'Don't you bother about that part of it. You are doing your share,
taking care of mother and Emma.'

'I am not taking care of them. It is you who are taking care of them. My friend, you are the head
of the house now.'

'Father!'

'Yes, we have come back to hard facts, and the defender of the house is
the head of it.'

'Me? Fudge.'

'It's true. The thing that makes me wince most is that some of my
contemporaries have managed to squeeze back: back into youth, Roger,
though I guess they were a pretty tight fit in the turnstile. There is
Coxon; he is in khaki now, with his hair dyed, and when he and I meet at
the club we know that we belong to different generations. I'm a decent
old fellow, but I don't really count any more, while Coxon, lucky dog,
is being damned daily on parade.'

'I hate your feeling it in that way, father.'

'I don't say it is a palatable draught, but when the war is over we
shall all shake down to the new conditions. No fear of my being
sarcastic to you then, Roger. I'll have to be jolly respectful.'

'Shut up, father!'

'You've begun, you see. Don't worry, Roger. Any rawness I might feel
in having missed the chance of seeing whether I was a man--like Coxon,
confound him!--is swallowed up in the pride of giving the chance to
you. I'm in a shiver about you, but--It's all true, Roger, what your
mother said about 2nd Lieutenants. Till the other day we were so little
of a military nation that most of us didn't know there were 2nd
Lieutenants. And now, in thousands of homes we feel that there is
nothing else. 2nd Lieutenant! It is like a new word to us--one, I
daresay, of many that the war will add to our language. We have taken
to it, Roger. If a son of mine were to tarnish it--'
