'I have come back, John, It hasn't seemed very long, has it?'

'No, not long, Ellen. Had you a nice walk?'

'I haven't been for a walk. Don't you remember where I told you I was going, John?'

'Yes, it was to a wedding.'

'You haven't forgotten whose wedding, have you?'

'Tell me, Ellen.' 

'I have been seeing Barbara married, John.'

'Yes, it was Barbara's wedding. They wouldn't--Ellen, why wasn't I there?'

'I thought you might be a little
troubled if you went, John. Sometimes your mind--not often, but
sometimes if you are agitated--and then you think you see--people who
aren't here any longer. Oh dear, oh dear, help me with these bonnet
strings.'

'Yes, I know. I'm all right when you are with me, Ellen. Funny, isn't it?'

'It _is_ funny, John. I ran
back to you, John. I was thinking of you all the time--even more than
of Billy boy.'

'Tell me all about it, Ellen. Did Billy boy
lose the ring? We always said he would lose the ring.'

'You have forgotten again, John. Barbara isn't married to Billy boy.'

'Not marry Billy! I'll see about that.'

'Sit down, dear, and I'll tell you
something again. It is nothing to trouble you, because your soldiering
is done, John; and greatly done. My dear, there is war again, and our
old land is in it. Such a war as my soldier never knew.'

'A war! That's it, is it? So now I know! Why wasn't I told? Why haven't I my marching orders? I'm not too
old yet.'

'Yes, John, you are too old, and all you can do now is to sit here
and--and take care of me. You knew all about it quite clearly this
morning. We stood together upstairs by the window listening to the
aircraft guns.'

'I remember! I thought it was a thunderstorm, Dering told me he heard
nothing.'

'Dering?'

'Our gardener, you know. Haven't I been talking with him, Ellen?'

'It is a long time since we had a gardener, John.'

'Is it? So it is! A war! That is why there is no more cricket on the green.'

'They have all gone to the war, John.'

'That's it; even the little shavers. Why isn't Billy boy fighting, Ellen?'

'Oh, John!'

'Is Billy boy dead? Was he killed in action? Tell me, tell
me! Good for Billy boy. I knew Billy boy was all
right. Don't cry, Ellen. I'll take care of you. All's well with Billy boy.'

'Yes, I know, John.'

He hesitates before speaking again. 'Ellen, who is the soldier? He comes
here. He is a captain.'

'He is a very gallant man, John. It is he who was married to Barbara to-day.'

'She has soon forgotten.'

'She hasn't forgotten, dear. And it's nearly three years now since Billy died.'

'So long! We have a medal he got, haven't we?'

'No, John; he died before he could win any medals.'

'Karl will be sorry. They were very fond of each other, those two boys, Ellen.'

'Karl fought against us, John. He died in the same engagement. They may
even have killed each other.'

'They hadn't known, Ellen.'

'I daresay they knew.'

'Billy boy and Karl!'

'John, I had Barbara married from here because she has no people of her own. I think Billy would have liked it.''That was the thing to do, Ellen. Nice of you. I remember everything
now. It's Dering she has married. He was once my gardener!'

'The world is all being re-made, dear. He is worthy of her.'

'Ellen, is Barbara a nurse?'

'Yes, John, and one of the staidest and most serene. Who would have
thought it of the merry madcap of other days! They are coming here,
John, to say good-bye to you. They have only a few days' leave. She is
in France, too, you know. She was married in her nurse's uniform.'

'Was she? She told me to-day that--no, it couldn't have been to-day.'

'You have been fancying you saw them, I suppose. You will be nice to them, John, won't you, and wish them luck?
They have their trials before them.'

'Tell me what to do, Ellen.'

'Don't say anything about Billy boy, John.'

'No, no, let's pretend.'

'And I wouldn't talk about the garden, John; just in case he is a little
touchy about that.'

'Not a word!'

'You see, I'm sure I would make a mess of it, so I'm trusting to you, John.'

'Leave it all to me, Ellen. I'll be frightfully sly. You just watch me.'

'Congratulations, Barbara. No, no, none of your handshaking; you don't
get past an old soldier in that way. Excuse me, young man. And to you, Captain Dering--you have won a prize.'

'I know it; I'll try to show I know it.'

'I haven't given Barbara a wedding present, Ellen, I should like----'

'Indeed you have, dear, and a lovely one. You haven't forgotten?'

'Oh--that! I was just quizzing you, Barbara. I hope you will be
as happy, dear, staid Barbara, as if you had married---- Observe me; I'm not going to say a word about him.'
