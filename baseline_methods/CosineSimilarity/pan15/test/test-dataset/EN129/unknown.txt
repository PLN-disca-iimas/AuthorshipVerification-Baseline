there isn't my match in Mayo for thatching, or mowing, or shearing a
sheep.

It's true the Lord God formed you to
contrive indeed. Doesn't the world know you reared a black lamb at your
own breast, so that the Lord Bishop of Connaught felt the elements of
a Christian, and he eating it after in a kidney stew? Doesn't the
world know you've been seen shaving the foxy skipper from France for a
threepenny bit and a sop of grass tobacco would wring the liver from a
mountain goat you'd meet leaping the hills?

Do you hear her now, young fellow? Do
you hear the way she'll be rating at your own self when a week is by?

Don't heed her. Tell her to go into her pigsty and not plague us here.

I'm going; but he'll come with me.

Are you dumb, young fellow?

God increase you; but I'm pot-boy in this place, and it's here I'd liefer stay.

Now you have heard him, and go on from this.

It's lonesome this hour crossing the hill, and if he won't come along with me, I'd have a right
maybe to stop this night with yourselves. Let me stretch out on the
settle, Pegeen Mike; and himself can lie by the hearth.

Faith, I won't. Quit off or I will send you now.

Well, it's a terror to be aged a score.God bless you now, young fellow, and let
you be wary, or there's right torment will await you here if you go
romancing with her like, and she waiting only, as they bade me say, on a
sheepskin parchment to be wed with Shawn Keogh of Killakeen.

What's that she's after saying?
