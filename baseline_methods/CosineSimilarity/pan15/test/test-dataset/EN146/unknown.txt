This is the ancient prophecy. Therefore the Lord himself shall give
you a sign; behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall
call his name Immanuel.

Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the evil and
choose the good.

For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose the
good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of both her
kings.


     I pray thee, tell me, Lady Bethlehemite,
     If any wonders you have seen this night?

     I've seen a wondrous silver shaft of light

   Come from a star, and blinded is my sight.

     Tell me, for thou art native of this place,
     What dost thou know about the King of Grace--
     King of the Jews?


     Aye, in Jerusalem
     He dwells, and not in Bethlehem.
     He sits upon his mighty judgment throne,
     Cruel and stern, his heart a living stone.


     I mean a new-born King, of love and peace;
     His is the star--His reign shall never cease.


     All things tonight seem passing strange to me,
     I have just read an ancient prophecy
     That this, our Bethlehem, King David's town,
     Shall be the birthplace, e'er of great renown,
     Of one called Councillor of King David's line
     Whose coming is foretold in words divine.
     And now you come with words of mystery!
     Why should thy questions, which are dark to me,
     Cause me to think of Him?


     The star! The star!
     No more it moves about the heavens afar,
     It standeth still. O, hostess, kneel and pray,
     For Jesus Christ, the Lord, is born today!


     His words are fraught with mystery; I'll within
     And seek protection in my humble inn.



     Three kings came riding from far away,
       Melchoir, Gaspar and Baltasar;
     Three wise men out of the east were they,
     And they traveled by night and they slept by day,
       For their guide was a beautiful, wonderful star.


     The star was so beautiful, large and clear,
       That all other stars of the sky
     Became a white mist in the atmosphere;
     And by this they knew that the coming was near
       Of the Prince foretold in prophecy.
