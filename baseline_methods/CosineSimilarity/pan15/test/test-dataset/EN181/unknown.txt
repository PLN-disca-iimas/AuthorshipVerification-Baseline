        
                 For every one, etc.

                           Sing high, sing low,
                           Wherever they go,
                                They all shall equal be!

                           Then hail! O King,
                                Whichever you may be,
                           To you we sing,
                                But do not bend the knee.
                           Then hail! O King.



            Come, let's away--our island crown awaits me--
                 Conflicting feelings rend my soul apart!
            The thought of Royal dignity elates me,
                 But leaving thee behind me breaks my heart!

                                       

            Farewell, my love; on board you must be getting;
                 But while upon the sea you gaily roam,
            Remember that a heart for thee is fretting--
                 The tender little heart you've left at home!

	                 Now, Marco dear,
                           My wishes hear:
                                While you're away
                           It's understood
                           You will be good
                                And not too gay.
                           To every trace
                           Of maiden grace
                                You will be blind,
                           And will not glance
                           By any chance On womankind!

                           If you are wise,
                           You'll shut your eyes
                                Till we arrive,
                           And not address
                           A lady less
                                Than forty-five.
                           You'll please to frown
                           On every gown
                                That you may see;
                           And, O my pet,
                           You won't forget
                                You've married me!

                 And O my darling, O my pet,
                 Whatever else you may forget,
                 In yonder isle beyond the sea,
                 Do not forget you've married me!

			You'll lay your head
                           Upon your bed
                                At set of sun.
                           You will not sing
                           Of anything
                                To any one.
                           You'll sit and mope
                           All day, I hope,
                                And shed a tear
                           Upon the life
                           Your little wife
                                Is passing here.

                           And if so be
                           You think of me,
                                Please tell the moon!
                           I'll read it all
                           In rays that fall
                                On the lagoon:
                           You'll be so kind
                           As tell the wind
                                How you may be,
                           And send me words
                           By little birds
                                To comfort me!
