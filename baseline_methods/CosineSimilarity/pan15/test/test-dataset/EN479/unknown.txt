'I'll try not to,' 

'If you did, I should just know that there had been something wrong
about me.'

'You're all right.'

'If I am, you are.' It is a winning face that Mr. Torrance turns on his
son. 'I suppose you have been asking yourself of late, what if you were
to turn out to be a funk!'

'Father, how did you know?'

'I know because you are me. Because ever since there was talk of this
commission I have been thinking and thinking what were you thinking--so
as to help you.'

'They all seem to be so frightfully brave, father,'

'I expect, Roger, that the best of them had the same qualms as you
before their first engagement.'

'I--I kind of think, father, that I won't be a funk.'

'I kind of think so too, Roger. Mind you don't be rash, my boy; and for God's sake, keep your head down in the
trenches.'

'You know you laughed at mother for saying that!'

'Did I? Roger, your mother thinks that I have an unfortunate manner with you.'

'Oh, I don't know. It's just the father-and-son complication.'

'That is really all it is. But she thinks I should show my affection for
you more openly.'

'I wouldn't do that. Of course for this once--but in a general way I wouldn't do that. We know, you and I.'

'As long as we know, it's no one else's affair, is it?'

'That's the ticket, father.'

'Still-- Still, before your mother--to please her--eh?'

'I suppose it would.'

'Well, what do you say?'

'I know she would like it.'

'Of course you and I know that display of that sort is all
bunkum--repellent even to our natures.'

'Lord, yes!'

'But to gratify her.'

'I should be so conscious.'

'So should I.'

'How far would you go?'

'Oh, not far. Suppose I called you "Old Rogie"? There's not much in
that.'

'It all depends on the way one says these things.'

'I should be quite casual.'

'Hum. What would you like me to call you?'

'It isn't what would _I_ like. But I daresay your mother
would beam if you called me "dear father"'

'I don't think so?'

'You know quite well that you think so, Roger.'

'It's so effeminate.'

'Not if you say it casually.'

'How does one say a thing like that casually?'

'Well, for instance, you could whistle while you said it--or anything of
that sort.'

'Hum. Of course you--if we were to--be like that, you wouldn't do
anything.'

'How do you mean?'

'You wouldn't paw me?'

'Roger, you forget yourself. That reminds me of a story I heard the other day of a French general. He had asked for volunteers
from his airmen for some specially dangerous job--and they all stepped
forward. Pretty good that. Then three were chosen and got their orders
and saluted, and were starting off when he stopped them. "Since when,"
he said, "have brave boys departing to the post of danger omitted to
embrace their father?" They did it then. Good story?'
'They were French.'

'Yes, I said so. Don't you think it's good?'

'Why do you tell it to me?'

'Because it's a good story.'

'You are sure, father, that there is no other reason? You know, father,
that is barred.'

'What is barred?'

'You know, I know that you are a young ass.'

'Really, father--'

'Hold your tongue.'

'I must say, father--'

'Be quiet, I tell you.'

'Oh dear! And I had hoped---Oh, John!'

'My fault,' 

'But whatever is the matter?'

'Nothing, mater. Only father wouldn't do as I told him.'

'Why the dickens should I?'

'You see, mater, he said I was the head of the house.'

'You, Rogie! What nonsense!'

'Do you like my joke, father?'

'Roger, you scoundrel!'
