 I never married with one, let alone with a couple or three.

Maybe he went fighting for the Boers, the like of the man
beyond, was judged to be hanged, quartered and drawn. Were you off east,
young fellow, fighting bloody wars for Kruger and the freedom of the
Boers?

I never left my own parish till Tuesday was a week.

He's done nothing, so. If you didn't commit murder or a bad, nasty thing, or false coining,
or robbery, or butchery, or the like of them, there isn't anything that
would be worth your troubling for to run from now. You did nothing at
all.

That's an unkindly thing to be saying to a poor orphaned traveller, has a prison behind him, and hanging before, and hell's gap gaping below.

You're only saying it. You did nothing at all. A soft lad the like of you wouldn't slit the
windpipe of a screeching sow.

You're not speaking the truth.

 Not speaking the truth, is it? Would you have me knock the head of you with the butt of the broom?

Don't strike me. I killed my poor father, Tuesday was a week, for doing the
like of that.

Is it killed your father?

With the help of God I did surely, and that the Holy Immaculate Mother may intercede for his soul.

There's a daring fellow.

Oh, glory be to God!

That was a hanging crime, mister honey. You should have had good reason for doing the like of that.

He was a dirty man, God forgive him, and he getting old and crusty, the way I couldn't put up
with him at all.

And you shot him dead?

I never used weapons. I've no license, and I'm a law-fearing man.

It was with a hilted knife maybe? I'm told, in the big world it's bloody knives they use.

Do you take me for a slaughter-boy?

You never hanged him, the way Jimmy Farrell hanged his dog from the license, and had it screeching and wriggling three hours at the butt
of a string, and himself swearing it was a dead dog, and the peelers
swearing it had life?
