She hasn't come yet,
is it, and it falling to the night?

She has not. . . It's dark with the
clouds are coming from the west and south,
but it isn't later than the common.

It's later, surely, and I
hear tell the Sons of Usna, Naisi and his
brothers, are above chasing hares for two days
or three, and the same awhile since when the
moon was full.

The gods send they don't set eyes on her -- yet if they do itself,
it wasn't my wish brought them or could send
them away.

If it wasn't, you'd do well to keep a check on her,
and she turning a woman that was meant to
be a queen.

Who'd check her like
was meant to have her pleasure only, the way
if there were no warnings told about her you'd
see troubles coming when an old king is taking
her, and she without a thought but for her
beauty and to be straying the hills.

The gods help the lot of
us. . . .  Shouldn't she be well pleased getting
the like of Conchubor, and he middling settled
in his years itself?  I don't know what he
wanted putting her this wild place to be
breaking her in, or putting myself to be roast-
ing her supper and she with no patience for
her food at all. 

Is she coming from the glen?
She is not.  But whisht
-- there's two men leaving the furze --
it's Conchubor and Fergus along
with him.  Conchubor'll be in a blue stew this
night and herself abroad.

Are they close by?

Crossing the stream, and
there's herself on the hillside with a load of
twigs.  Will I run out and put her in order
before they'll set eyes on her at all?

You will not.  Would
you have him see you, and he a man would
be jealous of a hawk would fly between her
and the rising sun. Go up
to the hearth and be as busy as if you hadn't
seen them at all.

should be in his tempers from the way he's
stepping out, and he swinging his hands.

matter. -- It'd be best of all, maybe, if he got
in tempers with herself, and made an end
quickly, for I'm in a poor way between the
pair of them. There they are now at the door.

The gods save you.

getting up and courtesy-ing. -- The gods save and keep you kindly, and
stand between you and all harm for ever.

Where is Deirdre?

trying to speak with indifference. -- Abroad upon Slieve Fuadh.  She
does be all times straying around picking
flowers or nuts, or sticks itself; but so long
as she's gathering new life I've a right not to
heed her, I'm thinking, and she taking her will.
A night with
thunder coming is no night to be abroad.

She's used to every track and pathway, and the
lightning itself wouldn't let down its flame to
singe the beauty of her like.

She's right, Conchubor, and let you sit down and take your
ease, and I'll count out what we've brought, and
put it in the presses within.

sitting down and looking about._ -- Where are the mats and hangings
and the silver skillets I sent up for Deirdre?

The mats and hangings
are in this press, Conchubor.  She wouldn't
wish to be soiling them, she said, running out
and in with mud and grasses on her feet, and
it raining since the night of Samhain.  The
silver skillets and the golden cups we have
beyond locked in the chest.

Bring them out and use
them from this day.

We'll do it, Conchubor.

pleased to speak of it. -- It is, Conchubor.  All say there isn't her match
at fancying figures and throwing purple upon
crimson, and she edging them all times with
her greens and gold.

a little uneasily. -- Is she
keeping wise and busy since I passed before,
and growing ready for her life in Emain?

dryly. -- That is a question will give small pleasure to yourself or me.
If it's the truth I'll tell you, she's growing too wise
to marry a big king and she a score only.  Let
you not be taking it bad, Conchubor, but you'll
get little good seeing her this night, for with
all my talking it's wilfuller she's growing these two months or three.
