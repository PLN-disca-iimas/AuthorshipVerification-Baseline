I am with you, Sire, but I fear it will not be so with
France. She has grown cynical. She will find the road through Belgium.

You seek to tempt me. She also signed the treaty.

Your Imperial Majesty judges others by yourself. I have
private ground for fearing that in the greed for a first advantage
France will call the treaty but a scrap of paper.

I think your private ground may be your own private newspaper.

She will say that necessity knows no law, or some such
dastard words.

Belgium is no craven. She will fight the betrayer.

France will hack her way through her.

My Chancellor, that is a hideous phrase.

I ask your pardon, Sire. It came, somehow, pat to my lips.

Your Imperial Majesty, the time passes. Will it please you to sign?

Bonaparte would have acted quickly.

Bonaparte!

The paper, Sire.

Leave it now with me. Return in an hour and you shall have it signed.

The least delay----

Overmuch reflection----

I wish to be alone.

Even a King's life is but a day, and in his day the sun is only
at its zenith once. This is my zenith; others will come to Germany,
but not to me. The world pivots on me to-night. They said Bonaparte,
coupling me with him. To dim Napoleon! Paris in three weeks--say four,
to cover any chance miscalculation; Russia on her back in six, with
Poland snapping at her, and then, after a breathing space, we
reach--The Day! We sweep the English Channel, changing its name as we
embark, and cross by way of Calais, which will have fallen easily into
our hands, the British fleet destroyed--for that is part of the
plan--Dover to London is a week of leisured marching, and London
itself, unfortified and panic-stricken, falls in a day! _VÃ¦ victis!_
I'll leave conquered Britain some balls to play with, so that there
shall be no uprising. Next I carve America in great mouthfuls for my
colonists, for now I strike the seas. It's all so docketed. I feel
it's as good as done before I set forth to do it. Dictator of the
world! And all for pacific ends. For once, the whole is mine. We come
at last to the great desideratum, a universal peace. Rulers over all!
God in the heavens, I upon the earth--we two! And there are still the Zeppelins! I'll sign!Who's that?

A friend. I am Culture, who has so long hovered well-placed
over happy Germany.

A friend--a consort! I would hear
you say, O Queen, that I have done some things for you.

You have done much for me. I have held my head higher since you
were added to the roll of sovereigns. I may have smiled at you at
times, as when you seemed to think that you were the two of us in one,
but as Kings go you have been a worthy King.

It was all done for you.

So, for long, I thought. I looked upon Germany's golden
granaries, plucked from ground once barren; its busy mills and
furnaces, its outstretching commerce and teeming people and noble
seats of learning, all mellowing in the sun, and I heard you say they
were dedicate to me, and I was proud. You have honored me, my Emperor,
and now I am here to be abased by you. All the sweet garments you have
robed me in, tear them off me and send me naked out of Germany.

You would not have me sign?

I warn you first to know yourself, you who have gloated in a
looking-glass too long.

I sign, so that Germany may be greater still, to spread your
banner farther; thus I make the whole world cultured.

My banner needs no such spreading. It has ever been your
weakness to think that I have no other home save here in Germany. I
have many homes, and the fairest is in France.

If that were true, Germany would care less for you.

If that is true, I have never had a home in Germany. I am no
single nation's servant, no single race's Queen. I am not of German
make. My banner is already in every land on which you would place your
heel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. I'll not have you
say you fight for me. Find some other reason.

The jealousies of nations----

All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the root
of all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those others
want that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them?
Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry:
"The blood be on their heads; they force me into war."

Germany must expand. That is her divine mission; I have it from on high.
