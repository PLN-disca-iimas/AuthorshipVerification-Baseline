               But, bless my heart, consider my position!
                 I am the wife of one, that's very clear;
            But who can tell, except by intuition,
                 Which is the Prince, and which the Gondolier?

	  Submit to Fate without unseemly wrangle:
                 Such complications frequently occur--
            Life is one closely complicated tangle:
                 Death is the only true unraveller!

	      Try we life-long, we can never
                 Straighten out life's tangled skein,
            Why should we, in vain endeavour,
                 Guess and guess and guess again?

 Life's a pudding full of plums,

 Care's a canker that benumbs.

 Life's a pudding full of plums, Care's a canker that benumbs.
Wherefore waste our elocution On impossible solution?
Life's a pleasant institution,  Let us take it as it comes!

 Set aside the dull enigma, We shall guess it all too soon;
 Failure brings no kind of stigma--  Dance we to another tune!

 String the lyre and fill the cup, Lest on sorrow we should sup.

Hop and skip to Fancy's fiddle, Hands across and down the middle--
Life's perhaps the only riddle That we shrink from giving up!



                      Bridegroom and bride!
                           Knot that's insoluble,
                           Voices all voluble
                      Hail it with pride.
                      Bridegroom and bride!
                           We in sincerity
                           Wish you prosperity,
                      Bridegroom and bride!
		When a merry maiden marries,
                 Sorrow goes and pleasure tarries;
                      Every sound becomes a song,
                      All is right, and nothing's wrong!
                 From to-day and ever after
                 Let our tears be tears of laughter.
                      Every sigh that finds a vent
                      Be a sigh of sweet content!
                 When you marry, merry maiden,
                 Then the air with love is laden;
                      Every flower is a rose,
                           Every goose becomes a swan,
                      Every kind of trouble goes
                           Where the last year's snows have gone!
			Sunlight takes the place of shade
                           When you marry, merry maid!

		       When a merry maiden marries,

                 Gnawing Care and aching Sorrow,
                 Get ye gone until to-morrow;
                      Jealousies in grim array,
                      Ye are things of yesterday!
                 When you marry, merry maiden,
                 Then the air with joy is laden;
                      All the corners of the earth
                           Ring with music sweetly played,
                      Worry is melodious mirth,
                           Grief is joy in masquerade;
