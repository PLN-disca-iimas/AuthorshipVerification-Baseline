And ye're aven makin' a bit of an iliphant for wee
Peter Pan.

 I am that. Here's the little, fat body. And here's the four legs.
 I'll just stick the legs on with
nails--and there he stands. Now, here's a little potato for a head,
and an ould skinny carrot for a trunk. I'll stick them on with a hair
pin. Now, I'll stick on the ears and put in the
shoe-button eyes, and with this wee bit of black paper for a
tailpiece, and there ye are. Mr. Mumbo Jumbo Mulligan as natural as
life and twice as handsome. 

Here's a doll baby I've dressed, but it's no head she
has at all, at all.

Use a big yellow apple or a wee yellow punkin, and put
on a baby cap--and there ye are. Stick in some buttons for eyes, and a
wee nose and mouth of red paper--and stick the head on the body with
some hair pins, and the quane herself niver had a better doll baby.

I'll put her right here on the table alongside of the
iliphant.

 It's nine o'clock, it is. Isn't it time for the children
to be home?

It is that. And here they come now.

     The Mulligans are coming now, as happy as can be,
     We've been to the Sunday School and saw the Christmas tree,
     Had a lark with Santa Claus and take a tip from me,
       We'll all be marching on Christmas!

       Hurrah, hurrah, the Mulligans are here,
       Hurrah, hurrah, for Santa Claus so dear,
           Sure, it was a happy night,
           The best one in the year,
       And we'll be marching on Christmas!

     Patsy got a trumpet, little Micky got a drum,
     Matsy got a spinning top, you ought to hear it hum,
     Clarissa got a candy cane, oh, won't we have the fun,
       When we are marching on Christmas!

       Hurrah, hurrah, the Mulligans are here,
