'Yes, perhaps.'

'Good-night, Robert.'

'Good-night, dear.'

'Dick!'

'I have come to sit with you for a bit, father.'

'It's you, Dick; it's you!'

'It's me all right, father. I say, don't be startled, or anything of that
kind. We don't like that.'

'My boy!'

'How am I looking, father?'

'You haven't altered, Dick.'

'Rather not. It's jolly to see the old studio again! I say, father, don't fuss. Let us be our ordinary selves, won't
you?'

'I'll try, I'll try. You didn't say you had come to sit with  me, Dick? Not with me!'

'Rather!'

'But your mother----'

'It's you I want.'

'Me?'

'We can only come to one, you see.'

'Then why me?'

'That's the reason. Hello, here's your old jacket, greasier than ever!'

'Me? But, Dick, it is as if you had forgotten. It was your mother who
was everything to you. It can't be you if you have forgotten that.
I used to feel so out of it; but, of course, you didn't know.'

'I didn't know it till lately, father; but heaps of things that I didn't
know once are clear to me now. I didn't know that you were the one who
would miss me most; but I know now.'

'Me miss you most? Dick, I try to paint just as before. I go to the
club. Dick, I have been to a dinner-party. I said I wouldn't give in.'

'We like that.'

'But, my boy----'

'I say, father, let's get away from that sort of thing.'

'That is so like you, Dick! I'll do anything you ask.'

'Then keep a bright face.'

'I've tried to.'

'Good man! I say, put on your old greasy; you are looking so beastly
clean.'

'Anything you like. No, that's the wrong sleeve. Thanks, Dick.'

'Here, let me shove you into your old seat.'

'How's that, umpire!'

'Dick, that's just how you used to butt me into it long ago!'

'When I was a kid.'

'With the palette in my hand.'

'Or sticking to your trousers.'

'The mess we made of ourselves, Dick.'
'I sneaked behind the settle and climbed up it.'

'Till you fell off.'

'On top of you and the palette.'

'Ah, Dick.'

'Now then, behave! What did I say about that face?'

'That's better. I'll sit here.'

'Got your pipe?'

'I don't--I don't seem to care to smoke nowadays, Dick.'

'Rot! Just because I am dead! You that pretend to be plucky! I won't
have it, you know. You get your pipe, and look slippy about it.'

'Yes, Dick,
Now, then, burn your thumb with the match--you always did, you know.
That's the style. You've forgotten to cock your head to the side. Not so
bad. That's you. Like it?'

'It's rather nice, Dick. Dick, you and me by the fire!'

'Yes, but sit still. How often we might have been like this, father,
and weren't.'

'Ah!'

'Face. How is Fido?'

'Never a dog missed her master more.'

'Oh, She doesn't want to go and sit on my grave, or any of
that tosh, does she? As if I were there!'

'No, no, she goes ratting, Dick.'

'Good old Fido!'

'Dick, here's a good one. We oughtn't to keep a dog at all because we
are on rations now; but what do you think Fido ate yesterday?'
