Harbor ill feeling, is it? Faith, then I'll not, Mollie
Mulligan, and it's meself that'll be bringing over a big cabbage head
on the morning for Shamus O'Brien's Christmas dinner.

I'll be after tidying up the house a bit.
It's little enough I've got for the children's Christmas tomorrow
morning; but at least I can have me house in order and a burning
candle shining in the windy. 

     This light shall burn on Christmas Day,
     For Him who in the manger lay,
     And all are welcome at my door,
     The high, the low, the rich, the poor,
     And every heart shall sing again
     Of peace on earth, good will to men.

Your burning candle takes me back again to the
days of me childhood in County Clare. Well do I mind me last Christmas
Eve in ould Ireland, the little thatched cabin with its one window,
the stinging smoke of the peat fire, the lads and the colleens and the
ould piper--and the merry dances and songs, do ye remember, Mollie,
darling? 


     Did you ever go into an Irishman's shanty,
     Where money was scarce but where welcome was plenty?
     A three-legged stool and a table to match it,
     But the door of the shanty is always unlatched.
       Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!

     Our nate little house, it looks out on the street,
     There's two beautiful rooms and a pig-sty complete.
     Each girl has a dress and each boy has a coat,
     There's tin happy children, six pigs and a goat.
       Tee-oodle, dum-doodle, dum-doodle, dum day!


It's lucky for us, darlin', that me husband is out at
his lodge tonight. I can stay with you until the children return from
the entertainment, and maybe it's a bit of a Christmas Eve high-jinks
we can be having afterwards.

Indade, I'm glad to have ye, Kathleen. Will your
husband be long at lodge?

 He will that. Pat is the Grand Exalted Chafe Ruler of the Benevolent and
Obstreperous Order of United Wooden-men, and he won't be home till
marnin'.
