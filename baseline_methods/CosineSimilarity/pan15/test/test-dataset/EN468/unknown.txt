Six yards of stuff for to make a
yellow gown. A pair of lace boots with lengthy heels on them and brassy
eyes. A hat is suited for a wedding-day. A fine tooth comb. To be
sent with three barrels of porter in Jimmy Farrell's creel cart on the
evening of the coming Fair to Mister Michael James Flaherty. With the
best compliments of this season. Margaret Flaherty.

Where's himself?

He's coming. To Mister Sheamus Mulroy, Wine and Spirit Dealer, Castlebar.

I didn't see him on the road.

How would you see him and is dark night this half hour gone by?

I stood a while outside wondering would I have a right to pass on or to walk in and see you,

and I could hear the cows breathing, and
sighing in the stillness of the air, and not a step moving any place
from this gate to the bridge.

It's above at the cross-roads he is, meeting Philly Cullen; and a couple more are going along with him
to Kate Cassidy's wake.

And he's going that length in the dark night?

He is surely, and leaving me lonesome on the
scruff of the hill. Isn't it long the nights are now, Shawn Keogh, to be
leaving a poor girl with her own self counting the hours to the dawn of
day?

If it is, when we're wedded in a short while you'll have no call to complain, for I've little will to be walking off to wakes or weddings in the darkness of the night.

You're making mighty certain, Shaneen, that I'll wed you now.

Aren't we after making a good bargain, the way we're only waiting
these days on Father Reilly's dispensation from the bishops, or the
Court of Rome.
