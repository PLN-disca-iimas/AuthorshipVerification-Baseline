Remember, I warn't hankerin' to have you come on this voyage,
Annie.

I wanted to be with you, David, don't you see? I didn't
want to wait back there in the house all alone as I've been doing these
last six years since we were married--waiting, and watching, and
fearing--with nothing to keep my mind occupied--not able to go back
teaching school on account of being Dave Keeney's wife. I used to dream
of sailing on the great, wide, glorious ocean. I wanted to be by your
side in the danger and vigorous life of it all. I wanted to see you the
hero they make you out to be in Homeport. And instead all I find is ice and cold--and brutality!

I warned you what it'd be, Annie. "Whalin' ain't no ladies' tea
party," I says to you, "and you better stay to home where you've got all
your woman's comforts." But you was so set on it.

Oh, I know it isn't your fault, David. You see,
I didn't believe you. I guess I was dreaming about the old Vikings in
the story books and I thought you were one of them.

I done my best to make it as cozy and
comfortable as could be. 
I even sent to the city for that organ for ye, thinkin' it might be
soothin' to ye to be playin' it times when they was calms and things was
dull like.

Yes, you were very kind, David. I know that.
I won't stand it--I can't stand
it--pent up by these walls like a prisoner. Take me away from here, David! If I don't get away from
here, out of this terrible ship, I'll go mad! Take me home, David! I
can't think any more. I feel as if the cold and the silence were
crushing down on my brain. I'm afraid. Take me home!

Best go to bed, Annie. You ain't yourself. You got fever. Your eyes look
so strange like. I ain't never seen you look this way before.

It's the ice and the cold and the
silence--they'd make any one look strange.

In a month or two, with good luck, three at the
most, I'll have her filled with ile and then we'll give her everything
she'll stand and p'int for home.

But we can't wait for that--I can't wait. I want to get
home. And the men won't wait. They want to get home. It's cruel, it's
brutal for you to keep them. You must sail back. You've got no excuse.
There's clear water to the south now. If you've a heart at all you've
got to turn back.
