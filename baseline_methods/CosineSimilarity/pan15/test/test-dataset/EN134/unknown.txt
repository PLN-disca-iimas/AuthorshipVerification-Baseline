Sure.

It's a great wonder you didn't forget it--and me without a
chew. 

Ouch! Darn you! 

Shut your big mouth! What is the matter with you
at all?

She pinched me--hard as she could, too--and look
at her laughin'!

Cry-baby! I owed you one.

I'll fix you. I'll tell Eileen, wait 'n' see!

Tattle-tale! I don't care. Eileen's sick.

That's why you dast do it. You dasn't if she was up. I'll get
even, you bet!

Shut up your noise! Go up to bed, the two of
you, and no more talk, and you go with them, Mary.

Come on, Mary. Wake up.

Ow!

Hush your noise, you soft,
weak thing, you! It's nothin' but blubberin' you do be doin' all the
time. I'll have a moment's peace, I
will! Off to bed with you before I get the strap! It's crazy mad you
all get the moment Eileen's away from you. Go on, now! And be quiet or I'll be up to you!

Can I say good-night to Eileen, Papa?

No. The doctor's with her yet.  Yes,
go in to her, Nora. It'll drive himself out of the house maybe, bad
cess to him, and him stayin' half the night. The rheumatics are in my leg again. If Eileen's in
bed long those brats'll have the house down.

Eileen ain't sick very bad, is she?

It's a cold only she has. Your poor mother died of the same. ra, well, it's
God's will, I suppose, but where the money'll come from, I dunno. They'll not be raisin' your
wages soon, I'll be bound.

Naw. The old boss never gives no one a raise, 'less
he has to. He's a tight-wad for fair.

 Five dollars a week--for
a strappin' lad the like of you! It's shamed you should be to own up to
it. A divil of a lot of good it was for me to go against Eileen's wish
and let you leave off your schoolin' this year like you wanted,
thinkin' the money you'd earn at work would help with the house.
