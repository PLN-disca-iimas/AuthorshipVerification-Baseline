Sire----

Is that the paper?

It awaits only your Imperial Majesty's signature.

When you have signed that paper, Sire, the Fatherland will be at war with France and Russia.

At last, this little paper----

Not of the value of a bird's feather until it has your royal signature. The----

Then it will sing round the planet. The vibration of it will
not pass in a hundred years. My friend, how still the world has grown
since I raised this pen! All Europe's listening. Europe! That's
Germany, when I have signed! And yet----

Your Imperial Majesty is not afraid to sign?

Afraid!

Oh, Sire!

I am irresistible to-day! "Red blood boils in my veins. To me
every open door is the gift of a world! I hear a thousand
nightingales! I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick my
teeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral."

That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you have
made us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat his
deity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the sword
must speak.

There the sword spoke--and yet the wise one
said: "Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the meal
go to them instead of to you." One at a time. Why am
I not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or France's
friend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.

For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire,
your signature!

What of Britain?

This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk,
draws near!

The Day! To The Day! But when?

Now, if she wants it!

There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued.
Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain.
Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join in
just now.

If I was sure of that!

I vouch for it. So well we've chosen our time, it finds her
at issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready to
turn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking with
the civic powers.

These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. It
is a land that in the past has done things.

In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone lies
Britain's greatness.

Yes, that's the German truth. Britain has grown dull and
sluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within her
such as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her,
but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most she'll play for is
her own safety. Pretend to grant her that and she'll seek her soft bed
again. Britain's part in the world's making is done. "I was," her epitaph.

How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some small
excuse for saying, "I acted in the best interests of my money-bags."
That excuse I've found for her. I have promised in your name a secret
compact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we do
not at present need we will not at present take.

A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely an
infamous proposal.

The British Government will not think so. Trust me to know
them, Sire. Your signature?

I can fling a million men within the week across
the border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.

There are a hundred gates to open that way.

My guns shall open them.

You can think of no easier road, Sire?

I think of it night and day.

One further north--through Belgium?

If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.

On the contrary, Sire----

Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor,
by my plighted word.

Yet, Sire----

No, no! I will not so stain my name.
