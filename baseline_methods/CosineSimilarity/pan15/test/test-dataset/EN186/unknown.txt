Oh Tweeny, Tweeny!

Have I offended of your feelings again, sir?

A little.

I'm full o' vulgar words and ways;
and though I may keep them in their holes when you are by, as soon as
I'm by myself out they comes in a rush like beetles when the house is
dark. I says them gloating-like, in my head--'Blooming' I says, and
'All my eye,' and 'Ginger,' and 'Nothink'; and all the time we was being
wrecked I was praying to myself, 'Please the Lord it may be an island as
it's natural to be vulgar on.'

That's the kind I am, sir. I'm 'opeless. You'd better give me up.

I won't give you
up. It is strange that one so common should attract one so fastidious;
but so it is. There is something about you, Tweeny,
there is a je ne sais quoi about you.

Is there, is there? Oh, I am glad.

We shall fight your vulgarity together. (All this time he has been arranging
sticks for his fire.) Now get some dry grass. (She brings him grass, and
he puts it under the sticks. He produces an odd lens from his pocket,
and tries to focus the sun's rays.)

Why, what's that?

That's the glass from my watch and
one from Mr. Treherne's, with a little water between them. I'm hoping to
kindle a fire with it.

Oh sir!

Danger! Crichton, a tiger-cat!

Where?

It is at our heels.

Look out, Crichton.

H'sh!

It will be on us in a moment.
Listen!

The grass is moving. It's coming.

Father.

Mary--Catherine--Agatha. Oh dear, my dears, my dears, oh
dear!

Darling.

Sweetest.

Love.

Glad to see you, sir.

Uncle, uncle, dear old uncle.

Ernest thought you were a tiger-cat.

Oh, did you? I knew you at once,
Ernest; I knew you by the way you ran.

My lord, I am glad.

But you are also idling, Crichton. We mustn't waste time. To
work, to work.

Yes, sir.

Ernest, you be a little more civil. Crichton, let me help.

Is that--but I suppose I'm dreaming again. It isn't
by any chance a pot on top of a fire, is it?

Indeed, it is, dearest. It is our supper.

I have been dreaming of a pot on a fire for two days. There 's nothing in it, is there?

Sniff, uncle.

It smells of onions!

Father, you have boots!

So he has.

Of course I have.

You are actually wearing boots, uncle.
It's very unsafe, you know, in this climate.

Is it?

We have all abandoned them, you observe. The blood, the
arteries, you know.

I hadn't a notion.

O Lord, yes.

Father, he is trying to get your boots from you.
There is nothing in the world we wouldn't give for boots.

I only wanted the loan of them.

If you lend them to
any one, it will be to us, won't it, father.

Certainly, my child.

Oh, very well. I don't want
your old boots. You don't think you
could spare me one boot?

I do not.

Quite so. Well, all I can say is I'm sorry for you.

Father, we thought we should never see you again.

I was washed ashore, my dear, clinging to a hencoop. How
awful that first night was.

Poor father.

When I woke, I wept. Then I began to feel extremely hungry.
There was a large turtle on the beach. I remembered from the Swiss
Family Robinson that if you turn a turtle over he is helpless. My dears,
I crawled towards him, I flung myself upon him the nasty, spiteful brute.
