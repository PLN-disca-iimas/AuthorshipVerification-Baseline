No fear of my beingsarcastic to you then, Roger. Ill have to be jolly respectful.Shut up, father!Youve begun, you see. Dont worry, Roger. Any rawness I might feelin having missed the chance of seeing whether I was a man--like Coxon,confound him!--is swallowed up in the pride of giving the chance toyou. Im in a shiver about you, but--Its all true, Roger, what yourmother said about 2nd Lieutenants.

Who is being married to-day, Dering?I have heard of no wedding, sir.

I am a clumsy.Not at all, but perhaps if I were to do it for myself. Thats better. Thank you, Barbara, very much.I didnt do it. Im all thumbs. What a ghastly nurse I should make.Nurse? Who is she, Barbara?Who is who, dear?That nurse.Theres no nurse here.Isnt there?Where is granny?She has gone down to the village to a wedding.Theres no wedding. Who could be being married?I think its people I know, but I cant remember who they are. Ithought you went too, Barbara.Not I. Catch me missing it if there had been a wedding!You and the nurse.Dear, you have just been imagining things again. Shall I play to you,or sing? Oh dear, everything catches in me. Would you like me to \"Robin Adair,\" dear?No, thank you, Barbara. Barbara, thehouse seems so empty. Where are Billy and Karl?Billy is where Karl is, you may be sure.And where is Karl?He is where Billy boy is, you may be sure.And where are they both?Not far from where Barbara is, you bet. Do you hear Karls flute? They have been down all themorning at the pool where the alder is, trying to catch that bull-trout.They didnt get him, Ill swear!You can ask them.I spent a lot of my youth trying to get that bull-trout. I tumbled inthere sixty years ago.I tumbled in sixty minutes ago! It cant be the same trout, dear.Same old rascal!You muddy things!Did you get the bull-trout, Billy boy?Hes a brute that.He is, you know.BILLY. He came up several times and had a look at my fly. Didnt flickit, or do anything as complimentary as that. Just yawned and went down.COLONEL. Yawned, did he? Used to wink in my time. Did you and Billyfish at Heidelberg, Karl?KARL.

Youwere a bit of a nailer at cricket yourself, sir.Ninety-nine against Mallowfield, and then bowled off my pads. Biggestscore I ever made. Mallowfield wanted to add one to make it the hundred,but I wouldnt let them. I was pretty good at steering them through theslips, Dering! Do you remember my late cut? It didnt matter where pointstood, I got past him. You used to stand at point, Dering.That was my grandfather, sir. If he was to be believed, he used to snapyou regular at point.Did he? I daresay he did. I cant play now, but I like to watch it still. Dering, there is no cricket on the green to-day. I have been down to look. I dont understand it, Dering. When Igot there the green was all dotted with them--its the prettiest sightand sound in England. But as I watched them they began to go away, oneand two at a time; they werent given out, you know, they went as ifthey had been called away. Some of the little shavers stayed on--andthen they went off, as if they had been called away too. The stumps wereleft lying about.

I would eat all the elephants in Hindustan and pick myteeth with the spire of Strassburg Cathedral.\"That is the Fatherland to-day. Such as we are, that you havemade us, each seeking to copy you in so far as man can repeat hisdeity. It was you fashioned us into a sword, Sire, and now the swordmust speak.There the sword spoke--and yet the wise onesaid: \"Take not your enemies together, but separately, lest the mealgo to them instead of to you.\" One at a time. Why amI not a friend of Russia till France is out of the way, or Francesfriend until the bear is muzzled? That was your part.For that I strove, but their mean minds suspected me. Sire,your signature!What of Britain?This--The Day, to which we have so often drunk,draws near!The Day! To The Day! But when?Now, if she wants it!There is no road to Britain--until our neighbors are subdued.Then, for us, there will be no roads that do not lead to Britain.Your Imperial Majesty, Britain will not join injust now.If I was sure of that!I vouch for it. So well weve chosen our time, it finds herat issue with herself, her wild women let loose, her colonies ready toturn against her, Ireland aflame, the paltry British Army sulking withthe civic powers.These wounds might heal suddenly if German bugles sounded. Itis a land that in the past has done things.In the past, your Imperial Majesty, but in the past alone liesBritains greatness.Yes, thats the German truth. Britain has grown dull andsluggish; a belly of a land, she lies overfed; no dreams within hersuch as keep powers alive--and timid, too--without red blood in her,but in its stead a thick, yellowish fluid. The most shell play for isher own safety. Pretend to grant her that and shell seek her soft bedagain. Britains part in the worlds making is done. \"I was,\" her epitaph.How well you know her, Sire! All she needs is some smallexcuse for saying, \"I acted in the best interests of my money-bags.\"That excuse Ive found for her. I have promised in your name a secretcompact with her, that if she stands aloof the parts of France we donot at present need we will not at present take.A secret bargain over the head of France, her friend! Surely aninfamous proposal.The British Government will not think so. Trust me to knowthem, Sire. Your signature?I can fling a million men within the week acrossthe border by way of Alsace and Lorraine.There are a hundred gates to open that way.My guns shall open them.You can think of no easier road, Sire?I think of it night and day.One further north--through Belgium?If I could dare! But no, that road is barred.On the contrary, Sire----Barred by a fortress no gun of mine may bear against--by honor,by my plighted word.Yet, Sire----No, no! I will not so stain my name.", "Oh Tweeny, Tweeny!Have I offended of your feelings again, sir?A little.Im full o vulgar words and ways;and though I may keep them in their holes when you are by, as soon asIm by myself out they comes in a rush like beetles when the house isdark.

I am nosingle nations servant, no single races Queen. I am not of Germanmake. My banner is already in every land on which you would place yourheel. Culture spreads not by way of maiming freedom. Ill not have yousay you fight for me. Find some other reason.The jealousies of nations----All are guilty there. Jealousy, not love of money, is the rootof all evil; that was a misprint. Yet I know of nothing those otherswant that is yours to give, save peace. What do you want of them?Bites out of each, and when they refuse to be dismembered you cry:\"The blood be on their heads; they force me into war.\"Germany must expand.

For Heavens sake, woman, be articulate.No, my lady; his lordship maycompel us to be equal upstairs, but there will never be equality in theservants hall.Whats that? No equality? Cant you see,Crichton, that our divisions into classes are artificial, that if wewere to return to nature, which is the aspiration of my life, all wouldbe equal?If I may make so bold as to contradict your lordship--Go on.The divisions into classes, my lord, are not artificial. Theyare the natural outcome of a civilised society. Theremust always be a master and servants in all civilised communities, mylady, for it is natural, and whatever is natural is right.It is very unnatural for me to stand here and allowyou to talk such nonsense.Yes, my lord, it is. That is what I have beenstriving to point out to your lordship.What is the matter with Fisher? She is lookingdaggers.The tedious creature; some question of etiquette, I suppose.How are you, Fisher?I am nothing, my lady, I am nothing atall.Oh dear, who says so?His lordship has asked that kitchen wench to have asecond cup of tea.But why not?If it pleases his lordship to offer it to her before offering itto me--So that is it. Do you want another cup of tea, Fisher?No, my lady--but my position--I should have been asked first.Oh dear.My friends, I am glad to see you all looking so happy. Itused to be predicted by the scoffer that these meetings would provedistasteful to you. Are they distasteful? I hear you laughing at thequestion.No harm in saying that among us to-day is one who was formerly hostileto the movement, but who to-day has been won over. I refer to LordBrocklehurst, who, I am sure, will presently say to me that if thecharming lady now by his side has derived as much pleasure from hiscompany as he has derived from hers, he will be more than satisfied.For the time being the artificial and unnatural--I say unnatural--barriers of society are sweptaway. Would that they could be swept away for ever.But that is entirely and utterly out of the question. And now for a fewmonths we are to be separated. As you know, my daughters and Mr. Ernestand Mr. Treherne are to accompany me on my yacht, on a voyage to distantparts of the earth. In less than forty-eight hours we shall be underweigh.Do not think our life on the yacht is to be one long idle holiday. Myviews on the excessive luxury of the day are well known, and what Ipreach I am resolved to practise. I have therefore decided that mydaughters, instead of having one maid each as at present, shall on thisvoyage have but one maid between them.My lord!My mind is made up.I cordially agree.And now, my friends, I should like to think that there issome piece of advice I might give you, some thought, some noble sayingover which you might ponder in my absence. In this connection I remember a proverb, which has had a great effect on my own life. I first heardit many years ago. I have never forgotten it. It constantly cheers andguides me. That proverb is--that proverb was--the proverb I speak of--Oh dear, I believe he has forgotten it.The proverb--that proverb to which I refer--I have it now--(not he).Crichton.One maid among three grown women!Mary, I think I had better go. That dreadfulkitchenmaid--I cant blame you, George.Your fathers views are shocking to me, and I am gladI am not to be one of the party on the yacht. My respect for myself,Mary, my natural anxiety as to what mother will say. I shall see you,darling, before you sail.Selfish brute, only thinking of himself. What about my speech?One maid among three of us. Whats to be done?Pooh! You must do for yourselves, thats all.Do for ourselves. How can we know where our things are kept?Are you aware that dresses button up the back?How are we to get into our shoes and be prepared for thecarriage?Who is to put us to bed, and who is to get us up, and howshall we ever know its morning if there is no one to pull up theblinds?"]}

Tell me now,are you well pleased that length with the sameman snorting next you at the dawn of day?Am I well pleased seven years seeing the same sun throw-ing light across the branches at the dawn ofday?  Its a heartbreak to the wise that its fora short space we have the same things only.Yet the earth itself is asilly place, maybe, when a mans a fool andtalker.Well, go, take yourchoice.  Stay here and rot with Naisi or go toConchubor in Emain.  Conchubors a wrinkledfool with a swelling belly on him, and eyesfalling downward from his shining crown;Naisi should be stale and weary.  Yet thereare many roads, Deirdre, and I tell you Idliefer be bleaching in a bog-hole than livingon without a touch of kindness from your eyesand voice.  Its a poor thing to be so lonesomeyoud squeeze kisses on a cur dogs nose.Are there no women likeyourself could be your friends in Emain?There are none like you, Deirdre.  Its for that Im asking areyou going back this night with Fergus?I will go where Naisi chooses.Its Naisi, Naisi, is it?  Then, I tell you, youllhave great sport one day seeing Naisi gettinga harshness in his two sheeps eyes and helooking on yourself.

Let you rest, Fergus, you should behot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.Its a sunny nook youve foundin Alban; yet any man would be well pleasedmounting higher rocks to fetch yourself andNaisi back to Emain.Theyve answered?  They would go?They have not, but when I was a young man wed have givena lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks;and to this day the old men have nothing soheavy as knowing its in a short while theylllose the high skies are over Ireland, and thelonesome mornings with birds crying on thebogs.  Let you come this day, for theres noplace but Ireland where the Gael can havepeace always.Its true, surely.

Its littlejoy wandering till age is on you and youryouth is gone away, so youd best come thisnight, for youd have great pleasure puttingout your foot and saying, \"I am in Ireland,surely.\"It isnt pleasure Id have while Conchubor is king in Emain.Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and thekings of Meath? Its easy being fearful and you alonein the woods, yet it would be a poor thing ifa timid woman couldturn away the Sons of Usna from the life ofkings.  Let you be thinking on the years tocome, Deirdre, and the way youd have a rightto see Naisi a high and white-haired justicebeside some king of Emain.  Wouldnt it be apoor story if a queen the like of you shouldhave no thought but to be scraping up herhours dallying in the sunshine with the sons ofkings?I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet youd do well,Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sakeof your own years, so youll not be saying tillyour hour of death, maybe, it was yourselfbrought Naisi and his brothers to a grave wasscooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see aqueen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what Im saying.

You know, when I was married I think I couldnt find the ring!Were you married here, sir?Yes, at the village church.So were my father and mother.I remember walking back with my wife and bringing her in here through the window. She kissed some ofthe furniture.I suppose you would like a grander affair, Barbara?No, just the same.I hoped you would say that.But, Billy, Im to have such a dream of a wedding gown.Granny is going with me to London, to choose it--laying her head on theColonels shoulder--if you can do without her for a day, dear.I shall go with you, I couldnt trust you and granny to choose the gown.You must often be pretty lonely, sir, when we are all out andabout enjoying ourselves.They all say that.

Oh, yes,she has gone down to the village to a wedding.A wedding?Its curious how he harps on that.She said to me to listen and I would hear the wedding bells.Not to-day, dear.Best not to worry him.But granny says we should try to make things clear to him.Was any one with granny when she said she was going to a wedding?You were there, Barbara.No, dear. He said that to me before. And something about a nurse.She was there, too.Any one else?There was that soldier.A soldier also!Just those three.But that makes four. Granny and Barbara and a nurse and a soldier.They were all there; but there were only three.Odd.Never mind, dear, Granny will make it all right.She is the one for you.She is the one for me.If there had been a wedding, wouldnt she have taken the Colonel with her?Of course she would.You are not too old to have a kind eye for a wedding, sir.Aha, aha! You know, if I had gone, verylikely I should have kissed the bride. Brides look so pretty on theirwedding day. They are often not pretty at other times, but they are allpretty on their wedding day.You have an eye for a pretty girl still, sir!Yes, I have; yes, I have!I do believe I see it all.

The roses be complaining, and, to make mattersworse, Miss Barbara has been watering of them--in the heat of the day.Has she? She means well. Dering, you heard it, didnt you? What was that, sir?The thunderstorm--early this morning.There was no thunderstorm, sir.That is what they all say. It was at four oclock. Igot up and looked out at the window. The evening primroses were verybeautiful.I dont hold much with evening primroses,sir; but I was out and about at four; there was no thunderstorm.I suppose I just thought there was one. Perhaps it wassome thunderstorm of long ago that I heard. They do come back, youknow.Do they, sir?I am glad to see you moving about in the garden, Dering, witheverything just as usual.Thank you, sir.No, dont go. I am--a little troubled, Dering.Everything be all right, sir.Im glad of that, the Colonel says with relief. It is pleasant to seethat you have come back, Dering. Why did you go away for such a longtime?Me, sir? Dering is a little aggrieved. I havent had a day off sinceChristmas.Havent you? I thought--Is everything just as usual, Dering?Yes, sir. There never were a place less changed than this.Thats true. The Colonel is appeased. Thank you, Dering, for sayingthat. But next moment he has lowered his voice again. Dering, there isnothing wrong, is there? Is anything happening that I am not being toldabout?Not that I know of, sir.That is what they all say, but--I dont know. Dering, I feel as if I was neededsomewhere. I dont know where it is. No one will tell me. Where is everyone?Theyre all about, sir. Theres a cricket match on at the village green.Is there?If the wind had a bit of south in it you could hear their voices. Youwere a bit of a nailer at cricket yourself, sir.Ninety-nine against Mallowfield, and then bowled off my pads. Biggestscore I ever made. Mallowfield wanted to add one to make it the hundred,but I wouldnt let them. I was pretty good at steering them through theslips, Dering! Do you remember my late cut? It didnt matter where pointstood, I got past him. You used to stand at point, Dering.That was my grandfather, sir. If he was to be believed, he used to snapyou regular at point.Did he? I daresay he did. I cant play now, but I like to watch it still. Dering, there is no cricket on the green to-day. I have been down to look. I dont understand it, Dering. When Igot there the green was all dotted with them--its the prettiest sightand sound in England. But as I watched them they began to go away, oneand two at a time; they werent given out, you know, they went as ifthey had been called away. Some of the little shavers stayed on--andthen they went off, as if they had been called away too. The stumps wereleft lying about. Why is it?Its just fancy, sir, I saw Master Will oiling his bat yesterday."]}

I suppose we cant have a littlelight?Certainly we can, dear. Darkness is quite unnecessary, but I think ithelps one to concentrate.You have not gone away, have you? We must be patient. Are youstill there?I think I felt a movement.Dont talk, please. Are you still there?Yes! It is your mother who is speaking; do you understand that?Yes. What shall I ask him now?We leave it to you, Mrs. Don.Have you any message you want to send us? Yes. Is itimportant? Yes. Are we to spell it out in the usual way? Yes. Is thefirst letter of the first word A? Is it B?Is the word _Love_? Yes. But I dont understand that movement. Youare not displeased with us, are you? No. Does the second word begin withA?--with B? Yes.Love Bade Me----If it is a quotation, I believe I know it! Is thefourth word  Welcome? Yes.Love Bade Me Welcome."]}

Of course you--if we were to--be like that, you wouldnt doanything.How do you mean?You wouldnt paw me?Roger, you forget yourself. That reminds me of a story I heard the other day of a French general. He had asked for volunteersfrom his airmen for some specially dangerous job--and they all steppedforward. Pretty good that. Then three were chosen and got their ordersand saluted, and were starting off when he stopped them. \"Since when,\"he said, \"have brave boys departing to the post of danger omitted toembrace their father?\" They did it then. Good story?They were French.Yes, I said so. Dont you think its good?Why do you tell it to me?Because its a good story.You are sure, father, that there is no other reason? You know, father,that is barred.What is barred?You know, I know that you are a young ass.Really, father--Hold your tongue.I must say, father--Be quiet, I tell you.Oh dear! And I had hoped---Oh, John!My fault, But whatever is the matter?Nothing, mater.

Then, if theres anything left and you can     Bring a small gift to wee Peter Pan.   Wasnt that dandy? Sure, little Mary Ann has a wonderful education, so she has!She takes after her own mother. I was just like herwhen I was that age.And youre just like her still, Mollie Mulligan. Sureyoure the sunshine of Mulligan Alley and the belle of Shantytown.Whist now! Its covered I am wid blushes. But, hush! Ithink the show is about to begin. Come and see Jumbo, Samson symbolical!     Come and see Slivers, Clown really comical!     Come and see Zip, the foremost of freaks!     Come and see Palestines Sinister Sheiks!     Eager Equestriennes, each unexcelled,     Most mammoth menagerie ever beheld,     The Giant, the Fat Girl, the Lion-faced Man,     Aerial Artists from far-off Japan,     Audacious Acrobats shot from a gun,     Dont miss the greatest show under the sun!Now, if you will kindly lend me your ears for a moment, I will fillthem free of charge with a few words concerning the worlds greatestassortment of marvelous monstrosities. In the first cell we have SenorMacaroni Spaghetti from the land of the banana. The senor isthirty-nine inches high, and, strangely enough, thirty-nine years old,to say nothing of the fact that he weighs thirty-nine pounds. He arrived last week by parcelpost to join our circus.

We used to play at schoolat marrying and giving in marriage, and the girl who was my bridegroomhad always to take the name of Billy. \"Do you, woman, take this manBilly--\" the clergyman in skirts began, and before I could answerdiffidently, some other girl was sure to shout, \"I should rather thinkshe does.\"Dont forget the ring, Billy. You know, when I was married I think I couldnt find the ring!Were you married here, sir?Yes, at the village church.So were my father and mother.I remember walking back with my wife and bringing her in here through the window. She kissed some ofthe furniture.I suppose you would like a grander affair, Barbara?No, just the same.I hoped you would say that.But, Billy, Im to have such a dream of a wedding gown.Granny is going with me to London, to choose it--laying her head on theColonels shoulder--if you can do without her for a day, dear.I shall go with you, I couldnt trust you and granny to choose the gown.You must often be pretty lonely, sir, when we are all out andabout enjoying ourselves.They all say that. But that is the time when Im not lonely,Karl. Its then I see things most clearly--the past, I suppose. It allcomes crowding back to me--India, the Crimea, India again--and its soreal, especially the people. They come and talk to me. I seem to seethem; I dont know they havent been here, Billy, till your granny tellsme afterwards.Yes, I know, I wonder where granny is.It isnt often she leaves you for so long, dear.She told me she had to go out, but I forget where. Oh, yes,she has gone down to the village to a wedding.A wedding?Its curious how he harps on that.She said to me to listen and I would hear the wedding bells.Not to-day, dear.Best not to worry him.But granny says we should try to make things clear to him.Was any one with granny when she said she was going to a wedding?You were there, Barbara.No, dear. He said that to me before. And something about a nurse.She was there, too.Any one else?There was that soldier.A soldier also!Just those three.But that makes four. Granny and Barbara and a nurse and a soldier.They were all there; but there were only three.Odd.Never mind, dear, Granny will make it all right.She is the one for you.She is the one for me.If there had been a wedding, wouldnt she have taken the Colonel with her?Of course she would.You are not too old to have a kind eye for a wedding, sir.Aha, aha! You know, if I had gone, verylikely I should have kissed the bride. Brides look so pretty on theirwedding day. They are often not pretty at other times, but they are allpretty on their wedding day.You have an eye for a pretty girl still, sir!Yes, I have; yes, I have!I do believe I see it all. Granny has been talking to youabout Billy boy and me, and you havent been able to wait; you havehurried on the wedding!Bravo, Barbara, youve got it.That may be it. Because I am sure you were to be there, Barbara.Our wedding, Billy!It doesnt explain those other people, though.What is it, dear?I cant quite remember, but I think that is why she didnttake me. It is your wedding, Barbara, but I dont think Billy boy is tobe there, my love.Not at my wedding!Grandfather!Theres something sad about it.There cant be anything sad about a wedding, dear. Grannydidnt say it was a sad wedding, did she?She was smiling.Of course she was.But I think that was only to please the nurse.That nurse again! Dear, dont think any more about it. Theresno wedding.Is there not?I told you! There is a wedding!Its Barbaras wedding. Billy boy, why are you not at Barbaraswedding?"]}

There isCoxon; he is in khaki now, with his hair dyed, and when he and I meet atthe club we know that we belong to different generations. Im a decentold fellow, but I dont really count any more, while Coxon, lucky dog,is being damned daily on parade.I hate your feeling it in that way, father.I dont say it is a palatable draught, but when the war is over weshall all shake down to the new conditions. No fear of my beingsarcastic to you then, Roger. Ill have to be jolly respectful.Shut up, father!Youve begun, you see. Dont worry, Roger. Any rawness I might feelin having missed the chance of seeing whether I was a man--like Coxon,confound him!--is swallowed up in the pride of giving the chance toyou. Im in a shiver about you, but--Its all true, Roger, what yourmother said about 2nd Lieutenants. Till the other day we were so littleof a military nation that most of us didnt know there were 2ndLieutenants. And now, in thousands of homes we feel that there isnothing else. 2nd Lieutenant!

Its a queer thing to seean old man sitting up there in his bed with no teeth in him, and a roughword in his mouth, and his chin the way it would take the bark from theedge of an oak board yould have building a door.... God forgive me,Micheal Dara, well all be getting old, but its a queer thing surely.Its too lonesome you are from living a long time with an oldman, Nora, and youre talking again like a herd that would be comingdown from the thick mist, but its a finelife youll have now with a young man, a fine life surely....Son of God deliver us.Now youll not marry her the time Imrotting below in the Seven Churches, and youll see the thing Ill giveyou will follow you on the back mountains when the wind is high."]}

Tell her from me that Servia has yielded onevery point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.Nay, Sire----And so, there will be no war.Sire, we beg----These are my commands.The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you.You! You have come here to mock me!Oh, no.I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and Iforbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as itwas before the war.It was you who made the war, O Emperor!Belgium?There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there restsa soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laidwaste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws ofwar which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they maydare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now bysmouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves ofmine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.She fought you where Crécy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo,with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in theirancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and theycried out: \"How is England doing?\" The living answered the dead upontheir bugles with the \"Alls well.\" England, O Emperor, was growndegenerate, but you, you, have made her great.France, Russia?They are here around your walls.My people?I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades ofyour soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.Do they curse me?None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have doneyour bidding.The women curse me?Not even the women. They, too, salute you.

And now you come with words of mystery!     Why should thy questions, which are dark to me,     Cause me to think of Him?     The star! The star!     No more it moves about the heavens afar,     It standeth still. O, hostess, kneel and pray,     For Jesus Christ, the Lord, is born today!     His words are fraught with mystery; Ill within     And seek protection in my humble inn.     Three kings came riding from far away,       Melchoir, Gaspar and Baltasar;     Three wise men out of the east were they,     And they traveled by night and they slept by day,       For their guide was a beautiful, wonderful star.     The star was so beautiful, large and clear,       That all other stars of the sky     Became a white mist in the atmosphere;     And by this they knew that the coming was near       Of the Prince foretold in prophecy."]}

She kissed some ofthe furniture.I suppose you would like a grander affair, Barbara?No, just the same.I hoped you would say that.But, Billy, Im to have such a dream of a wedding gown.Granny is going with me to London, to choose it--laying her head on theColonels shoulder--if you can do without her for a day, dear.I shall go with you, I couldnt trust you and granny to choose the gown.You must often be pretty lonely, sir, when we are all out andabout enjoying ourselves.They all say that. But that is the time when Im not lonely,Karl. Its then I see things most clearly--the past, I suppose. It allcomes crowding back to me--India, the Crimea, India again--and its soreal, especially the people. They come and talk to me. I seem to seethem; I dont know they havent been here, Billy, till your granny tellsme afterwards.Yes, I know, I wonder where granny is.It isnt often she leaves you for so long, dear.She told me she had to go out, but I forget where. Oh, yes,she has gone down to the village to a wedding.A wedding?Its curious how he harps on that.She said to me to listen and I would hear the wedding bells.Not to-day, dear.Best not to worry him.But granny says we should try to make things clear to him.Was any one with granny when she said she was going to a wedding?You were there, Barbara.No, dear. He said that to me before. And something about a nurse.She was there, too.Any one else?There was that soldier.A soldier also!Just those three.But that makes four. Granny and Barbara and a nurse and a soldier.They were all there; but there were only three.Odd.Never mind, dear, Granny will make it all right.She is the one for you.She is the one for me.If there had been a wedding, wouldnt she have taken the Colonel with her?Of course she would.You are not too old to have a kind eye for a wedding, sir.Aha, aha! You know, if I had gone, verylikely I should have kissed the bride. Brides look so pretty on theirwedding day. They are often not pretty at other times, but they are allpretty on their wedding day.You have an eye for a pretty girl still, sir!Yes, I have; yes, I have!I do believe I see it all. Granny has been talking to youabout Billy boy and me, and you havent been able to wait; you havehurried on the wedding!Bravo, Barbara, youve got it.That may be it. Because I am sure you were to be there, Barbara.Our wedding, Billy!It doesnt explain those other people, though.What is it, dear?I cant quite remember, but I think that is why she didnttake me. It is your wedding, Barbara, but I dont think Billy boy is tobe there, my love.Not at my wedding!Grandfather!Theres something sad about it.There cant be anything sad about a wedding, dear. Grannydidnt say it was a sad wedding, did she?She was smiling.Of course she was.But I think that was only to please the nurse.That nurse again! Dear, dont think any more about it.

Let you rest, Fergus, you should behot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.Its a sunny nook youve foundin Alban; yet any man would be well pleasedmounting higher rocks to fetch yourself andNaisi back to Emain.Theyve answered?  They would go?They have not, but when I was a young man wed have givena lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks;and to this day the old men have nothing soheavy as knowing its in a short while theylllose the high skies are over Ireland, and thelonesome mornings with birds crying on thebogs.  Let you come this day, for theres noplace but Ireland where the Gael can havepeace always.Its true, surely.  Yetwere better this place while Conchubors inEmain Macha.There are your sureties and Conchubors seal.I am your surety with Conchubor.  Youll not be young always, and itstime you were making yourselves ready forthe years will come, building up a homely dunbeside the seas of Ireland, and getting in yourchildren from the princes wives.  Its littlejoy wandering till age is on you and youryouth is gone away, so youd best come thisnight, for youd have great pleasure puttingout your foot and saying, \"I am in Ireland,surely.\"It isnt pleasure Id have while Conchubor is king in Emain.Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and thekings of Meath? Its easy being fearful and you alonein the woods, yet it would be a poor thing ifa timid woman couldturn away the Sons of Usna from the life ofkings.  Let you be thinking on the years tocome, Deirdre, and the way youd have a rightto see Naisi a high and white-haired justicebeside some king of Emain.  Wouldnt it be apoor story if a queen the like of you shouldhave no thought but to be scraping up herhours dallying in the sunshine with the sons ofkings?I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet youd do well,Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sakeof your own years, so youll not be saying tillyour hour of death, maybe, it was yourselfbrought Naisi and his brothers to a grave wasscooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see aqueen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what Im saying.  Youd do wellto come back to men and women are yourmatch and comrades, and not be lingeringuntil the day that youll grow weary, and hurtDeirdre showing her the hardness will growup within your eyes. . . .  Youre here yearsand plenty to know its truth Im saying.", "You wouldnt find your way, stranger, for theres a small pathonly, and it running up between two sluigs where an ass and cart wouldbe drowned.

Oh, yes,she has gone down to the village to a wedding.A wedding?Its curious how he harps on that.She said to me to listen and I would hear the wedding bells.Not to-day, dear.Best not to worry him.But granny says we should try to make things clear to him.Was any one with granny when she said she was going to a wedding?You were there, Barbara.No, dear. He said that to me before. And something about a nurse.She was there, too.Any one else?There was that soldier.A soldier also!Just those three.But that makes four.

You know, if I had gone, verylikely I should have kissed the bride. Brides look so pretty on theirwedding day. They are often not pretty at other times, but they are allpretty on their wedding day.You have an eye for a pretty girl still, sir!Yes, I have; yes, I have!I do believe I see it all. Granny has been talking to youabout Billy boy and me, and you havent been able to wait; you havehurried on the wedding!Bravo, Barbara, youve got it.That may be it. Because I am sure you were to be there, Barbara.Our wedding, Billy!It doesnt explain those other people, though.What is it, dear?I cant quite remember, but I think that is why she didnttake me.

It should be a sweet thing to havewhat is best and richest, if its for a shortspace only.And weve a short space only to be triumphant and brave.You must not go, Naisi, andleave me to the High King, a man is agingin his dun, with his crowds round him, andhis silver and gold.  I willnot live to be shut up in Emain, and wouldntwe do well paying, Naisi, with silence and anear death. Im a long while in the woodswith my own self, and Im in little dread ofdeath, and it earned with riches would makethe sun red with envy, and he going up theheavens; and the moon pale and lonesome, andshe wasting away. Isnt it asmall thing is foretold about the ruin of our-selves, Naisi, when all men have age comingand great ruin in the end?", "hand to stay you at all?Stranger.Whisht, whisht. Be quiet Im telling you, theyre coming now at the door.I wasnt long at all, stranger, for I met himself on the path.You were middling long, lady of the house.There was no sign from himself?No sign at all, lady of the house.Go over now and pull down the sheet, and look onhimself, Micheal Dara, and youll see its the truth Im telling you.I will not, Nora, I do be afeard of the dead. Will you drink a sup of tea with myself and theyoung man, stranger, or will you go intothe little room and stretch yourself a short while on the bed, Imthinking its destroyed you are walking the length of that way in thegreat rain.Is it to go away and leave you, and you having a wake, lady of thehouse? I will not surely. And its none of your tea Im asking either.Thats a poor coat you have, God help you, and Im thinking its a poortailor you are with it.If its a poor tailor I am, Im thinking its a poor herd does berunning back and forward after a little handful of ewes the way I seenyourself running this day, young fellow, and you coming from the fair.Let you not mind him at all, Micheal Dara, he has a drop taken and its soon hell be falling asleep.Its no lie hes telling, I was destroyed surely. They were thatwilful they were running off into one mans bit of oats, and anothermans bit of hay, and tumbling into the red bogs till its more like apack of old goats than sheep they were.

You are doing your share,taking care of mother and Emma.I am not taking care of them. It is you who are taking care of them. My friend, you are the headof the house now.Father!Yes, we have come back to hard facts, and the defender of the house isthe head of it.Me? Fudge.Its true. The thing that makes me wince most is that some of mycontemporaries have managed to squeeze back: back into youth, Roger,though I guess they were a pretty tight fit in the turnstile. There isCoxon; he is in khaki now, with his hair dyed, and when he and I meet atthe club we know that we belong to different generations. Im a decentold fellow, but I dont really count any more, while Coxon, lucky dog,is being damned daily on parade.I hate your feeling it in that way, father.I dont say it is a palatable draught, but when the war is over weshall all shake down to the new conditions. No fear of my beingsarcastic to you then, Roger. Ill have to be jolly respectful.Shut up, father!Youve begun, you see. Dont worry, Roger. Any rawness I might feelin having missed the chance of seeing whether I was a man--like Coxon,confound him!--is swallowed up in the pride of giving the chance toyou. Im in a shiver about you, but--Its all true, Roger, what yourmother said about 2nd Lieutenants. Till the other day we were so littleof a military nation that most of us didnt know there were 2ndLieutenants. And now, in thousands of homes we feel that there isnothing else. 2nd Lieutenant!

Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on anisland in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev.John Treherne, the Ladies Mary, Catherine, and Agatha Lasenby, with twoservants. We are the sole survivors of Lord Loams steam yacht Bluebell,which encountered a fearful gale in these seas, and soon became a totalwreck. The crew behaved gallantly, putting us all into the first boat.What became of them I cannot tell, but we, after dreadful sufferings,and insufficiently clad, in whatever garments we could lay hold of inthe dark--Please dont describe our garments.--succeeded in reaching this island, with the loss of only oneof our party, namely, Lord Loam, who flung away his life in a gallantattempt to save a servant who had fallen overboard. (The ladies havewept long and sore for their father, but there is something in this lastutterance that makes them look up.)But, Ernest, it was Crichton who jumped overboard trying to savefather.Well, you know, it was rather silly of uncle to fling away his life bytrying to get into the boat first; and as this document may be printedin the English papers, it struck me, an English peer, you know--Ernest, that is very thoughtful of you.--By night the cries of wild cats andthe hissing of snakes terrify us extremely--(this does not satisfyhim so well, and he makes a correction)--terrify the ladies extremely.Against these we have no weapons except one cutlass and a hatchet. Abucket washed ashore is at present our only comfortable seat--And Ernest is sitting on it.Hsh! Oh, do be quiet.--To add to our horrors, night fallssuddenly in these parts, and it is then that savage animals begin toprowl and roar.Have you said that vampire bats suck the blood from our toesas we sleep?No, thats all. I end up, Rescue us or we perish. Rich reward.Signed Ernest Woolley, in command of our little party. This is writtenon a leaf taken out of a book of poems that Crichton found in hispocket. Fancy Crichton being a reader of poetry. Now I shall put it intothe bottle and fling it into the sea.The tide is going out, we mustnt miss the post.Anything wrong, sir?"]}

Would you credit it, myfather used to be in the broom and heatherkissing Lavarcham, with a little bird chirpingout above their heads, and now shed scare araven from a carcase on a hill.  Queensget old, Deirdre, with their white and longarms going from them, and their backs hooping.  I tell you its a poor thing to see a queensnose reaching down to scrape her chin.Naisi and Fergus are coming on the path.Ill go so, for if I had you sevenyears Id be jealous of the midges and the dustis in the air.  Ill giveyou a riddle, Deirdre: Why isnt my father asugly and old as Conchubor?  Youve noanswer? . . . .  Its because Naisi killed him.Think of thatand you awake at night, hearing Naisi snor-ing, or the night you hear strange stories ofthe things Im doing in Alban or in Ulstereither.Fergus has brought messages of peace from Conchubor.He is welcome.  Let you rest, Fergus, you should behot and thirsty after mounting the rocks.Its a sunny nook youve foundin Alban; yet any man would be well pleasedmounting higher rocks to fetch yourself andNaisi back to Emain.Theyve answered?  They would go?They have not, but when I was a young man wed have givena lifetime to be in Ireland a score of weeks;and to this day the old men have nothing soheavy as knowing its in a short while theylllose the high skies are over Ireland, and thelonesome mornings with birds crying on thebogs.  Let you come this day, for theres noplace but Ireland where the Gael can havepeace always.Its true, surely.  Yetwere better this place while Conchubors inEmain Macha.There are your sureties and Conchubors seal.I am your surety with Conchubor.  Youll not be young always, and itstime you were making yourselves ready forthe years will come, building up a homely dunbeside the seas of Ireland, and getting in yourchildren from the princes wives.  Its littlejoy wandering till age is on you and youryouth is gone away, so youd best come thisnight, for youd have great pleasure puttingout your foot and saying, \"I am in Ireland,surely.\"It isnt pleasure Id have while Conchubor is king in Emain.Would you doubt the seals of Conall Cearneach and thekings of Meath? Its easy being fearful and you alonein the woods, yet it would be a poor thing ifa timid woman couldturn away the Sons of Usna from the life ofkings.  Let you be thinking on the years tocome, Deirdre, and the way youd have a rightto see Naisi a high and white-haired justicebeside some king of Emain.  Wouldnt it be apoor story if a queen the like of you shouldhave no thought but to be scraping up herhours dallying in the sunshine with the sons ofkings?I leave the choice to Naisi. Yet youd do well,Fergus, to go on your own way, for the sakeof your own years, so youll not be saying tillyour hour of death, maybe, it was yourselfbrought Naisi and his brothers to a grave wasscooped by treachery.  It is a poor thing to see aqueen so lonesome and afraid. Listen now to what Im saying.  Youd do wellto come back to men and women are yourmatch and comrades, and not be lingeringuntil the day that youll grow weary, and hurtDeirdre showing her the hardness will growup within your eyes. . . .

No fear of my beingsarcastic to you then, Roger. Ill have to be jolly respectful.Shut up, father!Youve begun, you see. Dont worry, Roger. Any rawness I might feelin having missed the chance of seeing whether I was a man--like Coxon,confound him!--is swallowed up in the pride of giving the chance toyou.

Of course you--if we were to--be like that, you wouldnt doanything.How do you mean?You wouldnt paw me?Roger, you forget yourself. That reminds me of a story I heard the other day of a French general. He had asked for volunteersfrom his airmen for some specially dangerous job--and they all steppedforward. Pretty good that. Then three were chosen and got their ordersand saluted, and were starting off when he stopped them. \"Since when,\"he said, \"have brave boys departing to the post of danger omitted toembrace their father?\" They did it then. Good story?They were French.Yes, I said so. Dont you think its good?Why do you tell it to me?Because its a good story.You are sure, father, that there is no other reason?

Do you want another cup of tea, Fisher?No, my lady--but my position--I should have been asked first.Oh dear.My friends, I am glad to see you all looking so happy. Itused to be predicted by the scoffer that these meetings would provedistasteful to you. Are they distasteful? I hear you laughing at thequestion.No harm in saying that among us to-day is one who was formerly hostileto the movement, but who to-day has been won over. I refer to LordBrocklehurst, who, I am sure, will presently say to me that if thecharming lady now by his side has derived as much pleasure from hiscompany as he has derived from hers, he will be more than satisfied.For the time being the artificial and unnatural--I say unnatural--barriers of society are sweptaway. Would that they could be swept away for ever.But that is entirely and utterly out of the question. And now for a fewmonths we are to be separated. As you know, my daughters and Mr. Ernestand Mr. Treherne are to accompany me on my yacht, on a voyage to distantparts of the earth. In less than forty-eight hours we shall be underweigh.Do not think our life on the yacht is to be one long idle holiday. Myviews on the excessive luxury of the day are well known, and what Ipreach I am resolved to practise. I have therefore decided that mydaughters, instead of having one maid each as at present, shall on thisvoyage have but one maid between them.My lord!My mind is made up.I cordially agree.And now, my friends, I should like to think that there issome piece of advice I might give you, some thought, some noble sayingover which you might ponder in my absence. In this connection I remember a proverb, which has had a great effect on my own life. I first heardit many years ago. I have never forgotten it. It constantly cheers andguides me. That proverb is--that proverb was--the proverb I speak of--Oh dear, I believe he has forgotten it.The proverb--that proverb to which I refer--I have it now--(not he).Crichton.One maid among three grown women!Mary, I think I had better go. That dreadfulkitchenmaid--I cant blame you, George.Your fathers views are shocking to me, and I am gladI am not to be one of the party on the yacht. My respect for myself,Mary, my natural anxiety as to what mother will say. I shall see you,darling, before you sail.Selfish brute, only thinking of himself. What about my speech?One maid among three of us. Whats to be done?Pooh! You must do for yourselves, thats all.Do for ourselves. How can we know where our things are kept?Are you aware that dresses button up the back?How are we to get into our shoes and be prepared for thecarriage?Who is to put us to bed, and who is to get us up, and howshall we ever know its morning if there is no one to pull up theblinds?"]}

Wont you--wont you say something civil to me in return,Roger?I sometimes--bragged about you at school.Did you? What sort of things, Roger?I--I forget.Come on, Roger.Is this fair, father?No, I suppose it isnt. Mr. Torrance attacks the coals again. You andyour mother have lots of confidences, havent you?I tell her a good deal. Somehow--Yes, somehow one can. With the artfulness that comes of years, Imglad you tell her everything.Not everything, father. There are things--about oneself--Arent there, Roger!Best not to tell her.Yes--yes.

But, as I tell you,I didnt know I had ceased to be young, I went into Regents Park andtried to run a mile.Lummy, you might have killed yourself.I nearly did--especially as I had put a weight on my shoulders torepresent my kit. I kept at it for a week, but I knew the game was up.The discovery was pretty grim, Roger.Dont you bother about that part of it. You are doing your share,taking care of mother and Emma.I am not taking care of them. It is you who are taking care of them. My friend, you are the headof the house now.Father!Yes, we have come back to hard facts, and the defender of the house isthe head of it.Me? Fudge.Its true. The thing that makes me wince most is that some of mycontemporaries have managed to squeeze back: back into youth, Roger,though I guess they were a pretty tight fit in the turnstile. There isCoxon; he is in khaki now, with his hair dyed, and when he and I meet atthe club we know that we belong to different generations. Im a decentold fellow, but I dont really count any more, while Coxon, lucky dog,is being damned daily on parade.I hate your feeling it in that way, father.I dont say it is a palatable draught, but when the war is over weshall all shake down to the new conditions. No fear of my beingsarcastic to you then, Roger. Ill have to be jolly respectful.Shut up, father!Youve begun, you see. Dont worry, Roger. Any rawness I might feelin having missed the chance of seeing whether I was a man--like Coxon,confound him!--is swallowed up in the pride of giving the chance toyou. Im in a shiver about you, but--Its all true, Roger, what yourmother said about 2nd Lieutenants. Till the other day we were so littleof a military nation that most of us didnt know there were 2ndLieutenants. And now, in thousands of homes we feel that there isnothing else. 2nd Lieutenant!

Im very glad, Barbara.You see, dear, Ive loved Billy boy since the days when hetried to catch the bull-trout with a string and a bent pin, and I heldon to his pinafore to prevent his tumbling in. We used to play at schoolat marrying and giving in marriage, and the girl who was my bridegroomhad always to take the name of Billy. \"Do you, woman, take this manBilly--\" the clergyman in skirts began, and before I could answerdiffidently, some other girl was sure to shout, \"I should rather thinkshe does.\"Dont forget the ring, Billy. You know, when I was married I think I couldnt find the ring!Were you married here, sir?Yes, at the village church.So were my father and mother.I remember walking back with my wife and bringing her in here through the window. She kissed some ofthe furniture.I suppose you would like a grander affair, Barbara?No, just the same.I hoped you would say that.But, Billy, Im to have such a dream of a wedding gown.Granny is going with me to London, to choose it--laying her head on theColonels shoulder--if you can do without her for a day, dear.I shall go with you, I couldnt trust you and granny to choose the gown.You must often be pretty lonely, sir, when we are all out andabout enjoying ourselves.They all say that. But that is the time when Im not lonely,Karl. Its then I see things most clearly--the past, I suppose. It allcomes crowding back to me--India, the Crimea, India again--and its soreal, especially the people. They come and talk to me. I seem to seethem; I dont know they havent been here, Billy, till your granny tellsme afterwards.Yes, I know, I wonder where granny is.It isnt often she leaves you for so long, dear.She told me she had to go out, but I forget where. Oh, yes,she has gone down to the village to a wedding.A wedding?Its curious how he harps on that.She said to me to listen and I would hear the wedding bells.Not to-day, dear.Best not to worry him.But granny says we should try to make things clear to him.Was any one with granny when she said she was going to a wedding?You were there, Barbara.No, dear. He said that to me before. And something about a nurse.She was there, too.Any one else?There was that soldier.A soldier also!Just those three.But that makes four. Granny and Barbara and a nurse and a soldier.They were all there; but there were only three.Odd.Never mind, dear, Granny will make it all right.She is the one for you.She is the one for me.If there had been a wedding, wouldnt she have taken the Colonel with her?Of course she would.You are not too old to have a kind eye for a wedding, sir.Aha, aha! You know, if I had gone, verylikely I should have kissed the bride. Brides look so pretty on theirwedding day. They are often not pretty at other times, but they are allpretty on their wedding day.You have an eye for a pretty girl still, sir!Yes, I have; yes, I have!I do believe I see it all. Granny has been talking to youabout Billy boy and me, and you havent been able to wait; you havehurried on the wedding!Bravo, Barbara, youve got it.That may be it. Because I am sure you were to be there, Barbara.Our wedding, Billy!It doesnt explain those other people, though.What is it, dear?I cant quite remember, but I think that is why she didnttake me. It is your wedding, Barbara, but I dont think Billy boy is tobe there, my love.Not at my wedding!Grandfather!Theres something sad about it.There cant be anything sad about a wedding, dear. Grannydidnt say it was a sad wedding, did she?She was smiling.Of course she was.But I think that was only to please the nurse.That nurse again! Dear, dont think any more about it. Theresno wedding.Is there not?I told you! There is a wedding!Its Barbaras wedding. Billy boy, why are you not at Barbaraswedding?"]}

We have a medal he got, havent we?No, John; he died before he could win any medals.Karl will be sorry. They were very fond of each other, those two boys, Ellen.Karl fought against us, John. He died in the same engagement. They mayeven have killed each other.They hadnt known, Ellen.I daresay they knew.Billy boy and Karl!John, I had Barbara married from here because she has no people of her own.

He is worthy of her.Ellen, is Barbara a nurse?Yes, John, and one of the staidest and most serene. Who would havethought it of the merry madcap of other days! They are coming here,John, to say good-bye to you. They have only a few days leave. She isin France, too, you know. She was married in her nurses uniform.Was she? She told me to-day that--no, it couldnt have been to-day.You have been fancying you saw them, I suppose. You will be nice to them, John, wont you, and wish them luck?They have their trials before them.Tell me what to do, Ellen.Dont say anything about Billy boy, John.No, no, lets pretend.And I wouldnt talk about the garden, John; just in case he is a littletouchy about that.Not a word!You see, Im sure I would make a mess of it, so Im trusting to you, John.Leave it all to me, Ellen. Ill be frightfully sly. You just watch me.Congratulations, Barbara. No, no, none of your handshaking; you dontget past an old soldier in that way. Excuse me, young man. And to you, Captain Dering--you have won a prize.I know it; Ill try to show I know it.I havent given Barbara a wedding present, Ellen, I should like----Indeed you have, dear, and a lovely one.

The crew behaved gallantly, putting us all into the first boat.What became of them I cannot tell, but we, after dreadful sufferings,and insufficiently clad, in whatever garments we could lay hold of inthe dark--Please dont describe our garments.--succeeded in reaching this island, with the loss of only oneof our party, namely, Lord Loam, who flung away his life in a gallantattempt to save a servant who had fallen overboard. (The ladies havewept long and sore for their father, but there is something in this lastutterance that makes them look up.)But, Ernest, it was Crichton who jumped overboard trying to savefather.Well, you know, it was rather silly of uncle to fling away his life bytrying to get into the boat first; and as this document may be printedin the English papers, it struck me, an English peer, you know--Ernest, that is very thoughtful of you.--By night the cries of wild cats andthe hissing of snakes terrify us extremely--(this does not satisfyhim so well, and he makes a correction)--terrify the ladies extremely.Against these we have no weapons except one cutlass and a hatchet. Abucket washed ashore is at present our only comfortable seat--And Ernest is sitting on it.Hsh! Oh, do be quiet.--To add to our horrors, night fallssuddenly in these parts, and it is then that savage animals begin toprowl and roar.Have you said that vampire bats suck the blood from our toesas we sleep?No, thats all. I end up, Rescue us or we perish. Rich reward.Signed Ernest Woolley, in command of our little party. This is writtenon a leaf taken out of a book of poems that Crichton found in hispocket. Fancy Crichton being a reader of poetry. Now I shall put it intothe bottle and fling it into the sea.The tide is going out, we mustnt miss the post.Anything wrong, sir?"]}

Wont you--wont you say something civil to me in return,Roger?I sometimes--bragged about you at school.Did you?

Think your mother and I are an aged pair, Roger?I never--of course you are not young.How long have you known that? I mean, its true--but I didnt know ittill quite lately.That youre old?Hang it, Roger, not so bad as that--elderly.

Icrossed the bridge, Roger, without knowing it.What made you know?What makes us know all the new things, Roger?--the war. Ill tell youa secret. When we realised in August of 1914 that myriads of us were tobe needed, my first thought wasnt that I had a son, but that I must getfit myself.You!Funny, isnt it? But, as I tell you,I didnt know I had ceased to be young, I went into Regents Park andtried to run a mile.Lummy, you might have killed yourself.I nearly did--especially as I had put a weight on my shoulders torepresent my kit. I kept at it for a week, but I knew the game was up.The discovery was pretty grim, Roger.Dont you bother about that part of it. You are doing your share,taking care of mother and Emma.I am not taking care of them. It is you who are taking care of them. My friend, you are the headof the house now.Father!Yes, we have come back to hard facts, and the defender of the house isthe head of it.Me? Fudge.Its true. The thing that makes me wince most is that some of mycontemporaries have managed to squeeze back: back into youth, Roger,though I guess they were a pretty tight fit in the turnstile. There isCoxon; he is in khaki now, with his hair dyed, and when he and I meet atthe club we know that we belong to different generations. Im a decentold fellow, but I dont really count any more, while Coxon, lucky dog,is being damned daily on parade.I hate your feeling it in that way, father.I dont say it is a palatable draught, but when the war is over weshall all shake down to the new conditions. No fear of my beingsarcastic to you then, Roger. Ill have to be jolly respectful.Shut up, father!Youve begun, you see. Dont worry, Roger. Any rawness I might feelin having missed the chance of seeing whether I was a man--like Coxon,confound him!--is swallowed up in the pride of giving the chance toyou. Im in a shiver about you, but--Its all true, Roger, what yourmother said about 2nd Lieutenants. Till the other day we were so littleof a military nation that most of us didnt know there were 2ndLieutenants. And now, in thousands of homes we feel that there isnothing else. 2nd Lieutenant!
