 Chase me? He did worse than chase me. He caught up with
me.

 And where is he now?

Niver a know do I know where he is. I left your boy
Matsy chasing him down the alley with a rope.

Bridget, go in the far room and get a wee drop of tay

all, at all.

A drop of tay will warm ye up. Hurry, Bridget.

Yis, mum.

for me owld man's Christmas dinner. I was bending over looking at the
cabbage whin all of a sudden I felt meself flying through the air and
I landed in the watering trough, so I did. And it was full of water.
And I'm almost killed entirely--and it's all the fault of your goat,
Mrs. Mulligan.

There, now, Kathleen, darlin', sit down and take things
easy.

I'll not sit down, Mollie Mulligan. Sure I'm thinking
I'll be after spindin' the rist of me life standing up on me two fate.

So the goat struck ye, did he?

 My, my, the trouble I've had all along of that Shamus
O'Brien. He's an awful goat, is Shamus O'Brien.


 Here's the tea, mum.

Thank ye kindly, Bridget. Here, Kathleen, take a cup of
tay and let it soothe your wounded feelings.

Sure, it's more than me feelings that is wounded, Mrs.
Mulligan.

Maw, ain't it time we were starting for the entertainment?

My, my, I've been that excited about the misdeeds of
that rascal Shamus O'Brien that I had forgotten the Christmas
entertainment entirely.

Sure, your family looks as though they were going out in
society, Mollie Mulligan.

entertainment at the Sunday School down the strate.

Matsy Mulligan, tie that goat in the back yard and tie all his four fate together. I'll
