Then when I'd my full share I'd come walking down where you'd
see the ducks and geese stretched sleeping on the highway of the road,
and before I'd pass the dunghill, I'd hear himself snoring out, a loud
lonesome snore he'd be making all times, the while he was sleeping, and
he a man 'd be raging all times, the while he was waking, like a gaudy
officer you'd hear cursing and damning and swearing oaths.

Providence and Mercy, spare us all!

It's that you'd say surely if you seen him and he after
drinking for weeks, rising up in the red dawn, or before it maybe, and
going out into the yard as naked as an ash tree in the moon of May, and
shying clods against the visage of the stars till he'd put the fear of
death into the banbhs and the screeching sows.

I'd be well-night afeard of that lad myself, I'm thinking. And there was no one in it but the two of you alone?

The divil a one, though he'd sons and daughters walking all
great states and territories of the world, and not a one of them, to
this day, but would say their seven curses on him, and they rousing up
to let a cough or sneeze, maybe, in the deadness of the night.

Well, you should have been a queer lot.
I never cursed my father the like of that, though I'm twenty and more
years of age.

Then you'd have cursed mine, I'm telling you, and he a man
never gave peace to any, saving when he'd get two months or three, or
be locked in the asylums for battering peelers or assaulting men  the way it was a bitter life he led me till I did up a Tuesday and halve his skull.

Well, you'll have peace in this place, Christy Mahon, and none to trouble you, and it's near
time a fine lad like you should have your good share of the earth.

It's time surely, and I a seemly fellow with great strength in
me and bravery of...

Oh, glory! it's late for knocking,
and this last while I'm in terror of the peelers, and the walking dead.
