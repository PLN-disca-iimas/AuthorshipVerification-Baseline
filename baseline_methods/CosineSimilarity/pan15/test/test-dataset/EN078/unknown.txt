'Perhaps Captain Dering has some little things to do: and you, too, Barbara. They are leaving in an hour, John.'

'If you would like to take
Barbara into the garden, Captain Dering---- No, not the garden, you wouldn't know your way about in the
garden.'

'Wouldn't I, Colonel?'

'No, certainly not. I'll show it you some day.'

'But there is a nice meadow just
beyond the shrubbery. Barbara knows the way; she often went there
with-- The Captain will be jealous, you know,'

'Let me, dear,' 

'She is much better at it than I am now, John.'

'I wouldn't go down by the stream, Barbara--not to the pool where the alder is.
There's--there's not a good view there, sir; and a boy--a boy I knew,
he often--nobody in particular--just a boy who used to come about the
house--he is not here now--he is on duty. I don't think you should go
to the alder pool, Barbara.'

'We won't go there, dear.'

'Did I do all right, Ellen?'

'Splendidly. I was proud of you.'

'I put them completely off the scent! They haven't a notion!
I can be very sly, you know, at times. Ellen, I think I should like to
have that alder tree cut down. There is no boy now, you see.'

'I would leave it alone, John. There will be boys again. Shall I read to
you; you like that, don't you?'

'Yes, read to me--something funny, if you please. About Sam Weller! No,
I expect Sam has gone to the wars. Read about Mr. Pickwick. He is very
amusing. I feel sure that if he had tried to catch the bull-trout he
would have fallen in. Just as Barbara did this morning.'

'Barbara?'

'She is down at the alder pool. Billy is there with that nice German
boy. The noise they make, shouting and laughing!'

'Which bit shall I read?'

'About Mr. Pickwick going into the lady's bedroom by mistake.'
'Yes, dear, though you almost know it by heart. You see, you have begun
to laugh already.'

'You are laughing too, Ellen. I can't help it!'

'But that was against your wish, was it not? Was that against your wish?
Would you prefer me not to ask that question?'

'Perhaps I am putting the question in the wrong
way. Are you not able to tell us any more?'

'There was a distinct movement that time, but it is so irregular.'

'I thought so, but please don't talk. Do you want to tell us more? Is it
that you can't hear me distinctly? He seems to want to tell us more, but
something prevents him.'

'In any case, Mrs. Don, it is extraordinary. This is the first seance I
have ever taken part in, but I must believe now.'

'Of course, Major, these are the simplest manifestations. They are only
the first step. But if we are to go on, the less we talk the better.
Shall we go on? It is not agitating you too much, Laura?'

'There was a moment when I--but I wish I was braver. I
think it is partly the darkness. I suppose we can't have a little
light?'

'Certainly we can, dear. Darkness is quite unnecessary, but I think it
helps one to concentrate.'


'You have not gone away, have you? We must be patient. Are you
still there?'

'I think I felt a movement.'

'Don't talk, please. Are you still there?'

'Yes! It is your mother who is speaking; do you understand that?'

'Yes. What shall I ask him now?'

'We leave it to you, Mrs. Don.'

'Have you any message you want to send us? Yes. Is it
important? Yes. Are we to spell it out in the usual way? Yes. Is the
first letter of the first word A? Is it B?'

'Is the word _Love_? Yes. But I don't understand that movement. You
are not displeased with us, are you? No. Does the second word begin with
A?--with B? Yes.'

'Love Bade Me----If it is a quotation, I believe I know it! Is the
fourth word  Welcome? Yes.'

'Love Bade Me Welcome.'
