 At last we have arrived at our destination.  This is
  the Ducal Palace, and it is here that the Grand Inquisitor
  resides.  As a Castilian hidalgo of ninety-five quarterings, I
  regret that I am unable to pay my state visit on a horse.  As a
  Castilian hidalgo of that description, I should have preferred to
  ride through the streets of Venice; but owing, I presume, to an
  unusually wet season, the streets are in such a condition that
  equestrian exercise is impracticable.  No matter.  Where is our
  suite?
   Your Grace, I am here.

 Why do you not do yourself the honour to kneel when you address His Grace?
My love, it is so small a matter!  Still, you may as well do it.
 
 The young man seems to entertain but an imperfect
  appreciation of the respect due from a menial to a Castilian
  hidalgo.

My child, you are hard upon our suite.

Papa, I've no patience with the presumption of persons
  in his plebeian position.  If he does not appreciate that
  position, let him be whipped until he does.

    And you'll discover never
                      A tale so free from every doubt--
                 All probable, possible shadow of doubt--
                 All possible doubt whatever!

         A tale free from every doubt, etc.

Then do you mean to say that I am married to one of
  two gondoliers, but it is impossible to say which?

Without any doubt of any kind whatever.  But be
  reassured: the nurse to whom your husband was entrusted is the
  mother of the musical young man who is such a past-master of that
  delicately modulated instrument (indicating the drum).  She can,
  no doubt, establish the King's identity beyond all question.

Heavens, how did he know that?

My young friend, a Grand Inquisitor is always up to
  date.   His mother is at present the wife of a highly
  respectable and old-established brigand, who carries on an
  extensive practice in the mountains around Cordova.  Accompanied
  by two of my emissaries, he will set off at once for his mother's
  address.  She will return with them, and if she finds any
  difficulty in making up her mind, the persuasive influence of the
  torture chamber will jog her memory.
