Oh, if you only would. I'd just love to have a great-a, beeg,
grand-a secret.

You can keep a secret, can't you?

 Of course I can. Girls can always keep secrets.

Some girls can't. But I believe you really can. Your
name's Anita, isn't it?

Yes. But how did you know?

Oh, we know everything. How old are you?

 If you tell me how you knew my name, I'll tell you how old I
am.

Well, I just guessed it.

 Then why don't you guess how old I am?

Cute, ain't you?

Not so verra cute. I'm going on nine.

Then you're old enough to keep the secret. Now, first you
must promise you won't tell until tomorrow morning.

Cross my heart.

Listen, then; here's the secret.

He is? _He is?_ Oh!!

 Yes, he is.

Honest?

 Honest injun!

With his pack and presents and a Christmas tree and everything?

Yes, ma'am, every single thing.

Tonight?

Just before the clock strikes twelve, when all the little
children in the steerage are asleep.

But how will he get out here in the middle of the ocean?

Fly.

Fly? But he hasn't any wings. He has? Really and truly wings?

Really and truly wings.

I never knew Santa Claus had wings before.

He only bought them this year.

Bought them? Then they didn't grow on him?

 Of course not. He's coming in an air ship.

Why, I never knew Santa Claus had an air ship.

He's got the very latest twentieth century model. He only
uses the reindeer once in a while now. He can go much faster on an air
ship. Oh, I'm tired.

 I didn't know pixies ever got tired.

You ought to see the work I've done today.

Here on the boat?
