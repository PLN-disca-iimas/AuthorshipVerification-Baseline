Your system of espionage is known to be tolerably complete.

All Germany is with me. I hold in leash the mightiest machine
for war the world has forged.

I have seen your legions, and all are with you. Never was a
Lord more trusted. O Emperor, does that not make you pause?

France invades little Belgium.

Chivalrous France! Never! Emperor, I leave one last word to you
at the parting of the ways. France, Russia, Britain, these are great
opponents, but it is not they will bring the pillars of Germany down.
Beware of Belgium!

Your Imperial Majesty has signed?

Thus 

Sire!

Say this to Russia, France, and Britain in my Imperial name: So
long as they keep within their borders I remain in mine.

But, Sire----

You know, as I do, that it is all they ask for.

You were the friend of Austria.

I'll prove it. Tell her from me that Servia has yielded on
every point which doth become a nation and that Austria may accept her terms.

Nay, Sire----

And so, there will be no war.

Sire, we beg----

These are my commands.

The decision lay with me, and I said there shall be peace. That be my zenith!

Sleep on, unhappy King. Better to wake if even your dreams appal you.
You! You have come here to mock me!

Oh, no.

I dreamed there was no war. In my dream they came to me and I
forbade the war. I saw the Fatherland smiling and prosperous, as it
was before the war.

It was you who made the war, O Emperor!

Belgium?

There is no Belgium now, but over what was Belgium there rests
a soft light, as of a helm, and through it is a flaming sword.

I dreamed I had kept my plighted word to Belgium.

It was you, O Emperor, who broke your plighted word and laid
waste the land. In the lust for victory you violated even the laws of
war which men contrive so that when the sword is sheathed they may
dare again face their Maker. Your way to Him is lighted now by
smouldering spires and ashes that were once fair academic groves of
mine, and you shall seek Him over roads cobbled with the moans of innocents.

In my dream I thought England was grown degenerate and would not fight.

She fought you where Cr√©cy was, and Agincourt, and Waterloo,
with all their dead to help her. The dead became quick in their
ancient graves, stirred by the tread of the island feet, and they
cried out: "How is England doing?" The living answered the dead upon
their bugles with the "All's well." England, O Emperor, was grown
degenerate, but you, you, have made her great.

France, Russia?

They are here around your walls.

My people?

I see none marching but men whose feet make no sound. Shades of
your soldiers who pass on and on, in never-ending lines.

Do they curse me?

None curses; they all salute you as they pass. They have done
your bidding.

The women curse me?

Not even the women. They, too, salute you. You were their
Father and could do no wrong.

And you?

I have come with this gaping wound in my breast to bid you
farewell.

God cannot let my Germany be utterly destroyed.

If God is with the Allies, Germany will not be destroyed. Farewell.
