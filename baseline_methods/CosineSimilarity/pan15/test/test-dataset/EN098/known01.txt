I'll not tell you a lie. There have been days a while past
when I've been throwing a line for salmon or
watching for the run of hares, that I've a dread
upon me a day'd come I'd weary of her voice,
and Deirdre'd see I'd wearied.

I knew it, Naisi. . . .  And take my word,
Deirdre's seen your dread and she'll have no
peace from this out in the woods.

She's not seen it. . . .  Deirdre's no thought of getting old
or wearied; it's that puts wonder in her days,
and she with spirits would keep bravery and
laughter in a town with plague.

That humour'll leave her.  But
we've no call going too far, with one word
borrowing another.  Will you come this night
to Emain Macha?

I'll not go, Fergus.  I've had
dreams of getting old and weary, and losing
my delight in Deirdre; but my dreams were
dreams only.  What are Conchubor's seals
and all your talk of Emain and the fools of
Meath beside one evening in Glen Masain?
We'll stay this place till our lives and time are
worn out.  It's that word you may take in
your curagh to Conchubor in Emain.

And you won't go, surely.

I will not. . . .  I've had dread,
I tell you, dread winter and summer, and the
autumn and the springtime, even when there's
a bird in every bush making his own stir till
the fall of night; but this talk's brought me
ease, and I see we're as happy as the leaves on
the young trees, and we'll be so ever and
always, though we'd live the age of the eagle
and the salmon and the crow of Britain.Where are your brothers?  My message is for them also.

You'll see them above chasing
otters by the stream.

It isn't much I was
mistaken, thinking you were hunters only.

You've heard my words to
Fergus?  Leave troubling,
and we'll go this night to Glen da Ruadh,
where the salmon will be running with the tide.
             
With the tide in a little while we will be journeying
again, or it is our own blood maybe will be
running away. The dawn and evening are a little while, the
winter and the summer pass quickly, and what
way would you and I, Naisi, have joy for ever?

We'll have the joy is highest till
our age is come, for it isn't Fergus's talk of
great deeds could take us back to Emain.

It isn't to great deeds you're
going but to near troubles, and the shortening
of your days the time that they are bright and
sunny; and isn't it a poor thing that I, Deirdre,
could not hold you away?

I've said we'd stay in Alban always.

There's no place to stay always. . . .  It's a long time we've had,
pressing the lips together, going up and down,
resting in our arms, Naisi, waking with the
smell of June in the tops of the grasses, and
listening to the birds in the branches that are
highest. . . .  It's a long time we've had, but
the end has come, surely.


Would you have us go to Emain,
though if any ask the reason we do not know
it, and we journeying as the thrushes come
from the north, or young birds fly out on a
dark sea?

There's reason all times for
an end that's come.  And I'm well pleased,
Naisi, we're going forward in the winter the
time the sun has a low place, and the moon
has her mastery in a dark sky, for it's you
and I are well lodged our last day, where there
is a light behind the clear trees, and the
berries on the thorns are a red wall.

If our time in this place is ended,
come away without Ainnle and Ardan to the
woods of the east, for it's right to be away
from all people when two lovers have their
love only.  Come away and we'll be safe
always.

There's no safe place, Naisi, on the ridge of the world.
. . . .  And it's in the quiet woods I've seen
them digging our grave, throwing out the clay
on leaves are bright and withered.

Come away, Deirdre, and it's little we'll think of safety or
the grave beyond it, and we resting in a little
corner between the daytime and the long night.

It's this hour we're between the daytime and a
night where there is sleep for ever, and isn't
it a better thing to be following on to a near
death, than to be bending the head down, and
dragging with the feet, and seeing one day
a blight showing upon love where it is sweet
and tender.

If a near death is coming what will be my
trouble losing the earth and the stars over it,
and you, Deirdre, are their flame and bright
crown?  Come away into the safety of the
woods.

There are as many ways to wither love as there
are stars in a night of Samhain; but there is
no way to keep life, or love with it, a short
space only. . . .  It's for that there's nothing
lonesome like a love is watching out the time
most lovers do be sleeping. . . .  It's for that
we're setting out for Emain Macha when the
tide turns on the sand.
