 Don't bring Hannibal in till I know where she's put
Edward!

Bad dog!  Bad dog!

Maud, do take him out!  Tie him up.  Here!  No--something stronger!  Poor darling
Edward! You are a bad dog!

Edward began it, Ella.  Bad dog!  Bad dog!

Tie him up outside.  Here, take my scarf.  Where is my
poor treasure?  Catch!  His ear's torn; I saw it.

Now! He smells horrible.  Bad dog--getting into ponds to fight!

Tie him up, Maud.  I must try in here.

Smell him, Bertie! You might have that pond drained, Squire!

All right!  I've bound him up!

May I come in?

Just a second!  I've got nothing on.

Oh!  There you are!

I was just going to wade in----

Hannibal would have killed him, if she hadn't rushed in!

Done him good, little beast!

Why didn't you go in, Tommy?

 Well, I would--only she----

I can't think how she got Edward out of Hannibal's awful
mouth!

 Bad dog!

 We must simply thank her tremendously!  I shall never
forget the way she ran in, with her skirts up to her waist!

All right!  Here's a bell!

 The bleeding's stopped.  Shall I send
him in to you?

 Oh, please!  Poor darling!

Look!  Hannibal's loose!  Maud--Tommy. You!

Yes, I know--you'd like to!  You SHALL bite
him when it's safe.  Oh!  my darling, you DO---- Have you tied him properly this time?

 With Bertie's braces.

Oh! but----

 It's all right; they're almost leather.





 By Jove!  No.  It was topping.

Her clothes must be ruined.  That pond--ugh!  Tommy, do have it drained.

 I don't remember her face in church.

 Ah!  Yes.  Who is she?  Pretty woman!

 I must get the Vet. to Edward.  Tommy,
do exert yourself!
