Nora Eudora, darlin', have ye got a sofy pillow handy. I
think if I had a couple of sofy pillows I could set down and enjoy me
tay.

Yis, mum. Here's two of 'em. 


Come on, all of yeez, or we'll be late for the show. And I
don't want to miss nothin'.

 I think yeez are all ready now. Let me see if there's anyone missing.

     There's Patsy and Matsy and Teddy Magee,
     Nora Eudora and Micky Machree,
     Bridget Honora and sweet Mary Ann,
     Melissa, Clarissa and wee Peter Pan.

We are all here, maw.

Now, yer all ready. Throw out yer heads. Forward, march!

Good-bye, maw.

Good-bye, and the Lord love yeez all. Have a good time. Good-bye. 

Ten of 'em. I don't see how ye ever manage to make both
ends meet, Mollie Mulligan, with ten big, healthy children--to say
nothing of the goat, Shamus O'Brien.

Good-bye. Have a good time. Mary Ann, don't let yer sash bust in two!


Ye have a fine family, Mrs. Mulligan. Ye have a fine
bunch of boys, and ye have a bunch of girls, and ye have a fine bunch
of babies; but ye have an awful goat.

Shamus O'Brien is the pest of me heart, Kathleen O'Toole; so he is; but he's all that's left of me late husband's
property. Michael Mulligan thought the world of that goat, he did.

 I'm a peaceful woman, Mollie Mulligan, and a calm,
neighborly woman; but I don't like goats.

 I don't blame ye at all, at all, Kathleen. But poor
Shamus O'Brien was probably only nosing around fer a bit of Christmas
Eve dinner. I'll kape him tied in the future.

Sure and it is Christmas Eve, isn't it?

Indade it is, and for the sake of the holy eve, I think
ye'd best be after forgiving the poor goat and not harbor any ill
feeling agin him on Christmas Day.
