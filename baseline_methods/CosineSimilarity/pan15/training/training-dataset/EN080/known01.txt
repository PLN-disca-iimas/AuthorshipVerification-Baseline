All you got to do is find the girl.

I have found her!

You have? When? I
thought you was saying--

This night. 
If she'll be having me. 'Tis
you I mean.

Say--are you--going crazy? Are you
trying to kid me? Proposing--to me!--for Gawd's sake!--on such short
acquaintance? 

I'm telling
you there's the will of God in it that brought me safe through the
storm and fog to the wan spot in the world where you was! Think of that
now, and isn't it queer--

Anna! 

Who d'you think you're talking to--a slave?

You need gat rest, Anna.
You gat sleep. What
you doing here, you sailor fallar? You ain't sick like oders. You gat
in fo'c's'tle. Dey give you bunk. You hurry, Ay tal
you!

But he is sick. Look at him. He can hardly stand
up.

Is it giving me orders ye are, me bucko? Let you look out, then! With
wan hand, weak as I am, I can break ye in two and fling the pieces over
the side--and your crew after you. I was
forgetting. You're her Old Man and I'd not raise a fist to you for the
world. 

Come on in the cabin.
You can have my bed if there ain't no other place.


Glory be to God, is it holding my arm about your neck you are! Anna!
Anna! Sure it's a sweet name is suited to you.

Sssh! Sssh!

Whisht, is it? Indade, and I'll not. I'll be roaring it out like
a fog horn over the sea! You're the girl of the world and we'll be
marrying soon and I don't care who knows it!

Ssshh! Never mind
that talk. You go to sleep. 

Dat's your dirty trick, damn ole davil, you!  But, py God, you don't do dat! Not while Ay'm living! No, py
God, you don't!My Yosephine, come
aboard de ship. Long time Ay wait for you.

I'm glad someone's feeling good.
Gee, I sure wish we was out of this dump and back in New
York.

Ay'm glad vhen ve sail again, too.  Ay
don't see vhy you don't like Boston, dough. You have good time here, Ay
tank. You go ashore all time, every day and night veek ve've been here.
You go to movies, see show, gat all kinds fun-- All with that damn Irish fallar!
