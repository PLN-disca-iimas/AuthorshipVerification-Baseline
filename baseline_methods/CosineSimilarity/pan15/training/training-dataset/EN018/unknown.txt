Lads like you, eh?

Ye take the words out o' my mouth. I'm the proper
lad for you, if it's meself do be saying it. Whisht, now, me daisy! Himself's in the
cabin. It's wan of your kisses I'm needing to take the tiredness from
me bones. Wan kiss, now! 

Leggo of me, you big mut! 

God stiffen it! 

You're coming to all right, eh? Gee, I was scared
for a moment I'd killed you.

Killed, is it? It'd take more than a bit of a blow to crack my thick
skull. But,
glory be, it's a power of strength is in them two fine arms of yours.
There's not a man in the world can say the same as you, that he seen
Mat Burke lying at his feet and him dead to the world.

Forget it. I'm sorry it happened, see?
Only you had no right
to be getting fresh with me. Listen, now, and don't go getting any more
wrong notions. I'm on this barge because I'm making a trip with my
father. The captain's my father. Now you know.

The old square--the old Swede, I mean?

Yes.

Sure I might have known it, if I
wasn't a bloody fool from birth. Where else'd you get that fine yellow
hair is like a golden crown on your head.

Say, nothing stops you, does it? [Then
attempting a severe tone again.] But don't you think you ought to be
apologizing for what you said and done yust a minute ago, instead of
trying to kid me with that mush?
