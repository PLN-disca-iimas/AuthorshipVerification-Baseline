Oh, he's coming, he's
coming. I'm going to get to see Santa Claus! Is it not wonderful? I'm
going to see him. Let me look.  Oh, it's getting
bigger and _bigger_ and BIGGER!

Hurray! daddy's coming! daddy's coming!

Now I can hear the bells. Oh, it's coming closer and _closer_
and CLOSER. Look out, it's going to hit the boat! 

He flew right by us.

Maybe he didn't see the boat. Oh, now he isn't coming at all.

Yes, he is. He's landed right over there. Here he comes; here he comes!

Here we are, Santa Claus. This is the place. Come in. Merry Christmas, Santa Claus, merry Christmas!


 Hello, there--where are you? It's so dark I can't see a single thing.

 Hello, daddy; merry Christmas.

 Hello yourself. Merry Christmas to you, too. Are you all ready for me?

Yes, it's all ready. The magical tree is just waiting for
your touch to turn into a real Christmas tree.

 Oh, we're going to have a real Christmas tree.

Hello, who's this young person?

This is Anita.

And why isn't she sound asleep like the rest of the
children?

She's such a good little girl that I told her she could
stay up with me and wait until you came.

Oh, ho; so you've made a hit with my boy, Jack
Frost, have you? Well, if that's the case, I guess you can stay.

But all of the children would like to see you, Santa Claus.
See, they've prepared the candle and the wreath of holly and the star
of Bethlehem all for you. There's Sergius and Tomasso and Hulda and
Meeny and Hans and Yakob and Neelda and Ah Goo and Sano San and Mieze
and the leetla Dutch twins, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum.
They've all been awfully good children. And Biddy Mary and Paddy Mike
they brought the candle. They're good, too.
