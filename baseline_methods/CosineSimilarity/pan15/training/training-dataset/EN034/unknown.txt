So long.  

Well,
what's up now?

Nutting--nutting. Anna!

Hello--father. She told me it
was you. I yust got here a little while ago.

It's good--for see you--after
all dem years, Anna. 

It's good to see you,
too.

Anna lilla! Anna lilla!

What's that--Swedish? I
don't know it.  Gee, I had an awful trip coming here. I'm all in. I had to
sit up in the dirty coach all night--couldn't get no sleep, hardly--and
then I had a hard job finding this place. I never been in New York
before, you know, and--

 You know you vas awful pooty gel, Anna? Ay
bet all men see you fall in love with you, py yiminy!

Cut it! You talk same as they all do.

Ain't no harm for your fader talk dat vay, Anna.

No--course not. Only--it's funny to see
you and not remember nothing. You're like--a stranger.

Ay s'pose. Ay never come home only few times ven you
vas kit in Sveden. You don't remember dat?

No. But why didn't you never come home them days?
Why didn't you never come out West to see me?

Ay tank, after your mo'der die, ven Ay vas avay on
voyage, it's better for you you don't never see me! [He sinks down in
the chair opposite her dejectedly--then turns to her--sadly.] Ay don't
know, Anna, vhy Ay never come home Sveden in ole year. Ay vant come
home end of every voyage. Ay vant see your mo'der, your two bro'der
before dey vas drowned, you ven you vas born--but--Ay--don't go. Ay
sign on oder ships--go South America, go Australia, go China, go every
port all over world many times--but Ay never go aboard ship sail for
Sveden. Ven Ay gat money for pay passage home as passenger den-- Ay forgat and Ay spend all money. Ven Ay tank
again, it's too late.  Ay don't know vhy but dat's vay with
most sailor fallar, Anna. Dat ole davil sea make dem crazy fools with
her dirty tricks. It's so.
