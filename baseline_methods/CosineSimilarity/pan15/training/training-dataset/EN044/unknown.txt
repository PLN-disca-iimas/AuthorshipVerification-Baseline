           Sullen night is laughing day--
                      All the year is merry May!

 And now our lives are going to begin in real earnest!
  What's a bachelor?  A mere nothing--he's a chrysalis.  He can't
  be said to live--he exists.

      What a delightful institution marriage is!  Why have
  we wasted all this time?  Why didn't we marry ten years ago?

 Because you couldn't find anybody nice enough.

 Because you were waiting for us.

I suppose that was the reason.  We were waiting for
you without knowing it. Hallo!

 Good morning.

If this gentleman is an undertaker it's a bad omen.

Ceremony of some sort going on?

He is an undertaker! No--a little unimportant family gathering.  Nothing in your line.

Somebody's birthday, I suppose?

Yes, mine!

And mine!

And mine!

And mine!

 Curious coincidence!  And how old may you all be?

It's a rude question--but about ten minutes.
 Remarkably fine children!  But surely you are jesting?

 In other words, we were married about ten minutes since.

Married!  You don't mean to say you are married?

 Oh yes, we are married.

 What, both of you?

All four of us.

Bless my heart, how extremely awkward!

You don't mind, I suppose?

You were not thinking of either of us for yourself, I
  presume?  Oh, Giuseppe, look at him--he was.  He's heart-broken!

 No, no, I wasn't!  I wasn't!

Now, my man we don't want anything in your line to-day, and if your curiosity's
 satisfied--you can go!

You mustn't call me your man.  It's a liberty.  I don't think you know who I am.

Not we, indeed!  We are jolly gondoliers, the sons of
  Baptisto Palmieri, who led the last revolution.  Republicans,
  heart and soul, we hold all men to be equal.  As we abhor
  oppression, we abhor kings: as we detest vain-glory, we detest
  rank: as we despise effeminacy, we despise wealth.  We are
  Venetian gondoliers--your equals in everything except our
  calling, and in that at once your masters and your servants.
