     Make haste, my son, the hour is waxing late,
     The night is cold, methinks our sheep await.


     Nay gran'ther, I would liefer tarry here.
     The town is gay, the inns are full of cheer.


     But there our duty lies, the wind grows cold!
     Come, let's away and put the sheep in fold.


     Nay, Simeon, wait! What means this crowd of men
     And women here in peaceful Bethlehem?


     Herod the King hath issued a decree
     That each and all his subjects tax√®d be;
     And every one who in this town saw light
     Must here return and register tonight.
     From all Judea, aye, from th' distant land,
     Each Bethlehemite must come at his command.


     The town is full of people, great and small,
     Each inn is crowded to its very wall.


     But come, we're wasting time, 'tis very late.
     Make haste, my son, I know the flocks await!


     Thou speakest true, though I would rather stay,
     Our duty calls, so to the hills, away!

     My inn is crowded to the doors. The heat
     Is stifling, but out here the air is sweet.



     The bright stars twinkle with mysterious light,
     Methinks there's something strange about the night.

 Some strange, unearthly voice seems calling me,
     Methinks this night portends great things to be.

     Hail, hostess of the inn, my cousin here
     Hath lodgings at your inn. We'd seek its cheer.

     Enter within. My guests tonight are gay
     And fain would turn this winter's night to day.

     Oh, mother, hark! There's music in the inn!


     'Tis not for us--their noise and merry din.


     Our little town is crowded, joyous, gay.


     So many travelers came this way today.


     The night is chill and cold, I much do fear
     The little sheep will shiver by the mere.


     Too cold it is for thee, I fear, in truth,
     Return and get thy cloak, my little Ruth.
     We'll wait for thee upon the little hill.
