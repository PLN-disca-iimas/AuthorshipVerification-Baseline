     But speed thy steps, the cold will work thee ill.


     I'll fly, dear mother, like an arrow home.



     We must not tarry. Come, my Thomas, come!

     Here is a place, now I must rest awhile!
     For many a league, for many a weary mile,
     We've trudged along since break of day began.


     'Tis true, and I'm an old and ancient man,
     My joints are stiff, my bones are waxing old--
     And the long night is bitter, bitter cold.
     Here take my cloak and keep thee warm within,
     And wait thee here while I search out an inn.


     For hours I've trudged the street in fruitless quest,
     Here is an inn, mayhap at last we'll rest.



     Husband, I'm faint; I can no farther go.
     Methinks I'll rest me here upon this loe.



     Have courage, Mary, here's the hostess here.



     We'd lodge with thee tonight.

     Alas, I fear
     My inn is crowded to the very wall,
     Soldiers and scribes, the rich, the great, the small!


     Is there room for us? My wife is ill.


     My heart is sad and it is not my will
     To send you hence, but naught is left to do.
     Perhaps some other inn will shelter you.


     Alas, the other inns are all the same!


     Never was seen the like in Bethlehem.



     My guests are merry, hear their jovial din!


     I pity you, there's no room at the inn.



     Our last hope gone! Now, what shall we do?
     My strength is leaving!


     Would I could succor you.
     I'll wrap thee warm. Now rest thee here a while.
     We've traveled far, full many a weary mile.


 Maiden, I fain would stop thee in thy flight--
     Can'st tell where we could lodge this winter night?

     That inn is crowded. There's one upon the hill.


     I've tried them all, my wife is very ill.


     That little stable there upon the loe,



     'Tis snug and warm. 'Twill shield thee from the snow.


     God's blessing on thy little head, sweet child!
     Come, Joseph, for the wind now waxes wild.
