That's because they didn't know them. They didn't
expect you at the party.

It was a surprise party, maw.

How was it a surprise party, Mary Ann?

They all looked surprised when we came in.

When I saw they weren't going to call out our names, I just rose
up in me seat and took the whole nine of 'em by the hand and marched
right up to Santa Claus. He looked real surprised at the bunch of us.

I should think he would.

"And who are you?" says he. "We're the ten little Mulligans from
Mulligan Alley in Shantytown," says I, as cool as an icicle. "And
we're ready for our presents, if it's all the same to you," says I. I
thought they was going to fire us out, but what did he do but dive way
down in the bottom of the sack and give every last one of us a present?

And then he gave us bags of candy and oranges and apples and
peanuts and popcorn and a candy cane, and then they had a show and
Bridget Honora spoke a piece, she did.

How did ye happen to spake a piece, Bridget Honora?

I just stood up and told 'em I knowed one. There ain't
nuthin' bashful about me. And I kind o' thought we ought to do
something to help pay fer the good things they gave us.

That's me good little Bridget Honora.

Oh, wee! Lookee there! Where'd she come from?

Santa Claus was after being here while you were away and
he left it for you.

Is it all for me?

It's the Mulligan dolly. It's fer all ten of yeez.

She can have my share. I don't want no dolls.

Oh, look at the efulunt. Look at the efulunt.

That is Mumbo Jumbo Mulligan from the sunny shores of
Africa, way down in Louisiana.

Who's he fur? Who's he fur?
