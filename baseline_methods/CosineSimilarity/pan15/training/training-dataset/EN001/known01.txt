 My, my, I was forgetting all about
the children and the mysterious fern seed. I wonder if it has changed
them back into real little children again. Yes,
here they come.

Oh, thank you, Mr. Wishing Man. I feel ever so much better
now.

Yes, indeed. My clothes are a perfect fit and nobody will laugh at me now.

I feel perfectly fan-tas-a-ma-gor-ious.

Oh, see the pretty French dollies. I wish they would talk to me.

If that's your wish, they can.

Can you talk?

Pa-pa, pa-pa, pa-pa!

 And what can you say?

 Ma-ma, ma-ma, ma-ma!

Go on and talk to me.

Mer-ry Christ-mas! Mer-ry Christ-mas!

I wish you could wind them up so they could walk around and
play with us.

Is that your wish?

Oh, yes. Do you think you can do it?

I can try.

Pa-pa, pa-pa, pa-pa! 

Here, stop her. She'll fall down.  Here, turn
around. Walk this way.

 Ma-ma, ma-ma, ma-ma; 

Oh, I think you are a darling.

Mer-ry Christ-mas! Mer-ry Christmas. 

Here, wait for me. 

Wind up the soldiers. Then each dolly can have a partner.

 Allow me.

Allow me. 

Allow me.

Oh, I wish they were all alive.

 You do? Is that your wish? Then I'll make them all alive.

     Hickety, kickety, bees in a hive,
     Witchery, twichery, you're alive.

 Oh, lookee! Candy!

That's alive, too. Mr. Snookie Ookums, let me introduce you to Mr. Jim Dandy, a stick of
candy.

Would he mind if I'd take a bite out of his leg?

You bet he would. I'm alive now.

And here comes Teddy Bear and Jimmy Bear. They're alive, too. And look at the Baby Elephant.
