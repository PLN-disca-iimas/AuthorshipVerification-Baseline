 Of course I'm sure. It was awful big. The biggest fish I ever
saw. Even in Russia we do not have such big fish as whales. Paddy Mike
saw it, too.

Sure and I did. And me two eyes nearly fell out of me head
with lookin' at it, it was that wonderful. He shot a big stream of
water right up out of his head, he did, and then he dived down in the
ocean again, and we didn't see him any more at all, at all.

 There! Now if you get to see the great big
whale, that's almost as good as having old Saint Nicholas come, ain't
it?

Whales can't bring you no Christmas presents, can they,
Klinker?

Und whales you can see any time. I'd rather have Saint
Nicholas, wouldn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?

Who is this Saint Nicholas they are looking for, Hulda?

Why, don't you know who he is yet? He's the best
old man that ever was. Und he comes the night before Christmas und
visits all the little children in Holland.

Und in Germany, too.

 Und if they're good they get candy und oranges und toys und
things, don't they, Schwillie Willie Winkum?

Und if they're bad, they get a good big birch stick. But I
ain't been bad. I've been awfully good, isn't I, Klinker?

Sure. Und me also.

On Christmas Eve in Holland all the children
march around the streets, following one who carries a big silver star.
And the people who meet us give us money and gifts to help the poor.
Oh, Christmas time is just grand in Holland!

Und we set out our leedle wooden shoes und old Saint Nicholas
fills 'em with candy.
