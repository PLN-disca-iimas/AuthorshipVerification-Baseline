Yes--we'll wait--certainly, we're all right.

I'll be havin' a nip now we're alone, and that cacklin'
hen gone. I'm feelin' sick in the pit of the stomach. 

For God's sake, don't! Put that bottle away! Don't you see that fellow in the chair there?

Ah, I'm not mindin' a man at all. Sure
I'll bet it's himself would be likin' a taste of the same. 

Stop it, you---- Don't you know he's probably a patient and
they don't allow them----

 A sick one, and him readin' a book like a dead
man without a civil word out of him! It's queer they'd be allowin' the
sick ones to read books, when I'll bet it's the same lazy readin' in
the house brought the half of them down with the consumption itself.
 I'm thinking this whole shebang is a big,
thievin' fake--and I've always thought so.

Put that bottle away, damn it! And don't shout.
You're not in a public-house.

I'll put it back when I'm ready, not
before, and no lip from you!

You're drunk now. It's disgusting.

 Drunk, am I? Is it the like of a young jackass like
you that's still wet behind the ears to be tellin' me I'm drunk?

 For heaven's sake, Mr. Carmody, remember where we are and don't raise any rumpus. What'll
Eileen say? Do you want to make trouble for her at the start?

It's a grand hotel this is, I'm thinkin', for the rich to be takin' their ease, and
not a hospital for the poor, but the poor has to pay for it.

Sssh!

Don't be shshin' at me? I'm tellin' you the truth. I'd make
Eileen come back out of this to-night if that divil of a doctor didn't
have me by the throat.

 I wonder how soon she'll be
back? The carriage is waiting for us. We'll have to hurry to make that
last train back. If we miss it--it means two hours on the damn tram.
