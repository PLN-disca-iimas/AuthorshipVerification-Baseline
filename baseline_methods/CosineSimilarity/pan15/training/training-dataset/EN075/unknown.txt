"The Orpheus legend is the--
er--apotheosis of animism.  Can we accept----"

Fine!  Fine!

Take up the curtain.  Mr Foreson?

Sir?

Everybody on.

Give us some light.

Electrics!  Turn up your floats!

I'd like to meet Miss Hellgrove. Miss Hellgrove, I want to say I
thought that fine--fine.  Fine.  It quite got
my soft spots.  Emotional.  Fine!

Oh!  Mr Frust; it means so much to me.  Thank you!

Er--fine! Where's Mr Flatway?

Fleetway.

Mr Fleetway, I want to say I thought your Orphoos very
remarkable.  Fine.

Thank you, sir, indeed--so glad you liked it.

 There wasn't much to it, but what there was was fine.  Mr Toone.

Mr Toone, I was very pleased with your Professor--quite a
character-study. Yes, sir!  I thought it fine. Who plays the goat?

I play the faun, Mr Frost.

Miss Maude 'Opkins.

Miss Hopkins, I guess your fawn was fine.

Oh! Thank you, Mr Frost.  How nice of you to say so.  I
do so enjoy playing him.

Mr Foreson, I thought the way you fixed that tree was very cunning; I certainly did.  Got a match?

Oh!  Mr Vane--do you think?  He seemed quite--Oh!  Mr Vane If only----

Yes, yes.  All right--you were splendid.
He liked it.  He quite----

How wonderful Oh, Mr Vane, thank you!

That lighting's just right now, Miller.  Got it marked carefully?

Yes, Mr Vane.

Good. Well, sir?  So glad----

Mr Vane, we got little Miggs on contract?

Yes.

Well, I liked that little pocket piece fine.  But I'm blamed
if I know what it's all about.

Why!  Of course it's a little allegory.
The tragedy of civilization--all real feeling for Beauty and Nature
kept out, or pent up even in the cultured.

Ye-ep. Little Miggs'd be fine in "Pop goes the Weasel."

Yes, he'd be all right, but----

Get him on the 'phone, and put it into rehearsal right now.

What!  But this piece--I--I----!
