Ay know it! Ay know dat
vas so!

Anna! Is it
making game of me you'd be? 'Tis a quare time to joke with me, and
don't be doing it, for the love of God.

D'you think I'd kid you now?
No, I'm not joking, Mat. I mean what I said.

Ye don't! Ye can't! 'Tis mad you are. I'm telling you!

No I'm not.

But what's come over you so sudden? You was
saying you loved me--

I'll say that as often as you want me to. It's true.

Then why--what, in the divil's name--Oh, God
help me, I can't make head or tail to it at all!

Because it's the best way out I can figure, Mat. I been thinking it over and thinking it over day and night
all week. Don't think it ain't hard on me, too, Mat.

For the love of God, tell me then, what is it that's preventing
you wedding me when the two of us has love? Is it giving heed to the like of
that old fool ye are, and him hating me and filling your ears full of
bloody lies against me?

Yes, Anna believe me, not you! She know her
old fa'der don't lie like you.

You sit down, d'you hear? Where
do you come in butting in and making things worse? You're like a devil,
you are! Good Lord, and I was beginning to like you,
beginning to forget all I've got held up against you!

You ain't got nutting for hold against me,
Anna.

Ain't I yust! Well, lemme tell you--[Say, Mat, I'm s'prised at you. You didn't think
anything he'd said--

Sure, what else would it be?

Think I've ever paid any attention to all his crazy bull? Gee,
you must take me for a five-year-old kid.

I don't know
how to take you, with your saying this one minute and that the next.

Well, he has nothing to do with it.

Then what is it has? Tell me, and don't keep me waiting and
sweating blood.
