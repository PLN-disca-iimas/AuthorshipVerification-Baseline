  And now to choose our brides!

  As all are young and fair, And amiable besides,

 We really do not care A preference to declare.

 A bias to disclose Would be indelicate--

 And therefore we propose To let impartial Fate Select for us a mate!

 Viva!

A bias to disclose Would be indelicate--

 But how do they propose To let impartial Fate Select for them a mate?

These handkerchiefs upon our eyes be good enough to bind,

And take good care that both of us are absolutely blind;

Then turn us round--and we, with all convenient despatch, Will undertake to
 marry any two of you we catch!

Viva! They undertake to marry any two of us\them they catch!

  Are you peeping? Can you see me?

Dark I'm keeping, Dark and dreamy!


 If you're blinded Truly, say so

 All right-minded Players play so!


Conduct shady! They are cheating! Surely they deserve a beating!
    
 This too much is; Maidens mocking-- Conduct such is Truly shocking!
       
You can spy, sir! Shut your eye, sir! You may use it by and by, sir!
You can see, sir! Don't tell me, sir!
That will do--now let it be, sir!

My papa he keeps three horses,
Black, and white, and dapple grey, sir;
Turn three times, then take your courses,
Catch whichever girl you may, sir!

 My papa, etc.

I've at length achieved a capture! This is Tessa! Rapture, rapture!

 Rapture, rapture!

To me Gianetta fate has granted! Just the very girl I wanted!

 Just the very girl he wanted!

If you'd rather change--

 My goodness! This indeed is simple rudeness.

I've no preference whatever--

Listen to him!  Well, I never!

		Thank you, gallant gondolieri!
                      In a set and formal measure
                 It is scarcely necessary
                      To express our pleasure.
                      Each of us to prove a treasure,
                 Conjugal and monetary,
                      Gladly will devote our leisure,
                 Gay and gallant gondolieri.
                      Tra, la, la, la, la, la, etc.
