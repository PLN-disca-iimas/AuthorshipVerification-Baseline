God's curse on you!

Listen, Mat! You hadn't come, and I'd gave up hope. But--in the
station--I couldn't go. I'd bought my ticket and everything. But I
got to thinking about you--and I couldn't take the train--I couldn't!
So I come back here--to wait some more. Oh, Mat, don't you see I've
changed? Can't you forgive what's dead and gone--and forget it?

Forget, is it? I'll
not forget 'til my dying day, I'm telling you, and me tormented with
thoughts. Oh, I'm wishing I had wan of them fornenst me
this minute and I'd beat him with my fists 'till he'd be a bloody
corpse! I'm wishing the whole lot of them will roast in hell 'til the
Judgment Day--and yourself along with them, for you're as bad as they
are.

Mat! Well, you've had your say. Now you better beat it.

And
what'll you be doing?

What difference does it make to you?

I'm asking you!

My bag's packed and I got my ticket. I'll go
to New York to-morrow.

You mean--you'll be doing the same again?

Yes.

You'll not! Don't torment me with that talk! 'Tis
a she-divil you are sent to drive me mad entirely!

Oh, for Gawd's sake, Mat, leave me alone!
Go away! Don't you see I'm licked? Why d'you want to keep on kicking me?

And don't you deserve the worst I'd say, God
forgive you?

All right. Maybe I do. But don't rub it in. Why ain't you done
what you said you was going to? Why ain't you got that ship was going
to take you to the other side of the earth where you'd never see me
again?

I have.

What--then you're going--honest?

I signed on to-day at noon, drunk as I was--and she's sailing
to-morrow.
