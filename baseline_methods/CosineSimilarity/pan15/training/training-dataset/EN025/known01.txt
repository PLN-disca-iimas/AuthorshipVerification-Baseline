     Just tell me what your wishes are,
       For I'm the Wishing Man.
     I have wishbones on my fingers,
       I have myst'ry in my eyes,
     My clothes are trimmed with horseshoes,
       And they're stained with magic dyes.
     My pocket's full of rabbits' feet,
       And clover leaves and charms,
     For luck I've got a big black cat
       All tattooed on my arms,
     I'm a friend of all the children,
       And I'll help you if I can,
     So tell me what your wishes are--
       For I'm the Wishing Man.

     I come from a distant country
       Away up near the pole,
     But the things that I am telling you,
       You mustn't tell a soul.
     I know every witch and goblin,
       And if you would believe!
     I have fortunes in my pocket-book,
       And wonders up my sleeve.
     When any little boy or girl
       Says, "Wishing Man, appear!"
     I jump right up from underneath,
       And here I am, my dear!
     I'm a friend of all the children,
       And I'll help you if I can,
     So tell me what your wishes are--
        For I'm the Wishing Man.

And can you really grant us anything we wish for?

I can, if it's a good wish--and if you all agree on the
same thing.

Anything in the wide, wide world?

Well, pretty nearly anything. Would you like some new toys?

Oh, no, thank you. This is Christmas, you know, and we got ever so many toys.

Ever so many toys.

I don't see what you called me for. You seem to have
everything you want.

Oh, no, we haven't. We've made a wish, and we're all agreed on it.

 Are you sure it's a good wish?

Oh, yes, it's an awful good wish. You see, we want to be
great big children so we can stay up late at night and go to Aunt
Clara's dinner parties. That's our wish. We want to be the biggest
children there are anywhere.
