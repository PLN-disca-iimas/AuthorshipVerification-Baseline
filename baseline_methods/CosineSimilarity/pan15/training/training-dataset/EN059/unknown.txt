A Christmas tree. A look at old Santa Claus. Some nice Christmas
presents, etc.

Stop, stop. I can't attend to so many wishes at once.

 Please, Mr. Wishing Man, couldn't you tell us
what we'd better wish for?

Have you ever had a great, big Christmas tree?

Oh, yes, lots of times.

Have you ever seen my old friend, Mr. Santa Claus?

 Oh, yes.

We see him every year at Christmas.

 How would like to go with me to Wishing Land.

 Oh, goody! That would be fine. Can you
take us there?

Of course I can. And that's just what we'll do. We'll all
of us go to the Wishing Land. First, I'll call little Dumpling.
Dumpling, little Dumpling, where are you?

Here I am, Mr. Wishing Man. I was playing with my little horse and wagon.

And how do you like being a great, big Dumpling?

Well, not very well. I'm always bumping my head on the doors
and things. And all my toys are so very little I'm always breaking them.

Where is your sister? Where is little Tootsy?

 Here, Mr. Wishing Man. I'm here. Me and my little dolly.

Well, little Tootsy, how do you like being a great, big Tootsy?

I don't like it very well. My clothes don't seem to fit, and I
know I look awfully funny.  Don't I? Everybody laughs
at me and it always makes me cry. 

And where is little Snookie Ookums?

Here I am, Mr. Wishing Man. Here's 'ittie Snookie Ookums.

 You look like a 'ittie baby elephant, Snookie Ookums.
Well, are you children satisfied with your wish?

Not very much. We wish we were little again.

I tried to ride my little horsie and I bweaked him
all to pieces.

And I can't get enough to eat. My little knife and fork and
spoon are too little, and when I eat I swallow dishes and all.

And all my clothes are too little for me, and I look so funny
that everybody laughs at me. And I don't like it at all.
