Anna! It ain't so--

But one thing I
never wrote you. It was one of them cousins that you think is such nice
people--the youngest son--Paul--that started me wrong. It
wasn't none of my fault. I hated him worse 'n hell and he knew it. But
he was big and strong----like you!

God blarst it!


Anna!

That was
why I run away from the farm. That was what made me get a yob as nurse
girl in St. Paul. And you think that was
a nice yob for a girl, too, don't you? With all them
nice inland fellers yust looking for a chance to marry me, I s'pose.
Marry me? What a chance! They wasn't looking for marrying. [I'm owning up to
everything fair and square. I was caged in, I tell you--yust like in
yail--taking care of other people's kids--listening to 'em bawling and
crying day and night--when I wanted to be out--and I was
lonesome--lonesome as hell! So
I give up finally. What was the use? You don't
say nothing--either of you--but I know what you're thinking. You're
like all the rest! And who's to blame for it, me
or you? If you'd even acted like a man--if you'd even been a regular
father and had me with you--maybe things would be different!

Don't talk dat vay, Anna! Ay go crazy! Ay von't
listen! 

You will too listen! 
You--keeping me safe inland--I wasn't no nurse girl the last two
years--I lied when I wrote you--I was in a house, that's what!--yes,
that kind of a house--the kind sailors like you and Mat goes to in
port--and your nice inland men, too--and all men, God damn 'em! I hate
'em! Hate 'em! 

Anna! Anna! It's lie! It's lie! 

So that's what's in it!

I s'pose you remember your promise, Mat? No other reason was to count with you so long as I wasn't married already. So I s'pose
you want me to get dressed and go ashore, don't you? Yes,
you do!
