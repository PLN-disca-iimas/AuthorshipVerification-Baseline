And do your best to cheer the patient up
when you talk to her. Give her confidence in her ability to get well.
That's half the battle. And she'll believe it, coming from you.

Yes, yes, I'll do all I can.

And don't take it to heart too much yourself.
There's every hope, remember that. In six months she'll come back to
you her old self again.

It's hard on a fellow--so suddenly--but I'll
remember--and---- Good night, Doctor.

Good night.

Has he gone away?

 Yes. He told me
to tell you he'd be back to-morrow with definite information--about the
sanatorium business.

Oho, he did, did he? Maybe I'll surprise him. I'm
thinkin' it's lyin' he is about Eileen's sickness, and her lookin' as
fresh as a daisy with the high colour in her cheeks when I saw her now.

That's silly, Mr. Carmody. Gaynor knows his
business. He told me all about Eileen's sickness.

Did he now, the auld monkey! Small thanks to
him to be tellin' our secrets to the town.

I didn't want to learn your affairs. He only
told me because you'd said I and Eileen were engaged. You're the one
who was telling--secrets.

 Ara, don't be talkin'! That's no secret at all
with the whole town watchin' Eileen and you spoonin' together from the
time you was kids.

Well, the whole town is liable to find out----

To hell with the town and all in it! I've troubles enough of my own. So he
told you he'd send Eileen away to the hospital? I've half a mind not to
let him--and let him try to make me! (_With a frown._) But Eileen
herself says she's wantin' to go, now. (_Angrily._) It's all that
divil's notion he put in her head that the children'd be catchin' her
sickness that makes her willin' to go.
