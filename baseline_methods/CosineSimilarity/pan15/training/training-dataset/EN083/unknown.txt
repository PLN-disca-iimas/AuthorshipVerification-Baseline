It's gatting pooty late in
night, Anna. Must be near five bells.

Five bells? What time is that?

Half past ten.

Funny I don't know nothing about sea talk--but those cousins was
always talking crops and that stuff. Gee, wasn't I sick of it--and of
them!

You don't like live on farm, Anna?

I've told you a hundred times I hated it. I'd rather
have one drop of ocean than all the farms in the world! Honest! And you
wouldn't like a farm, neither. Here's where you belong. But not on a coal barge. You belong on a
real ship, sailing all over the world.

Ay've done dat many year, Anna, when Ay vas damn fool.

Oh, rats! Was
the men in our family always sailors--as far back as you know about?

Yes. Damn fools! All men in our village on coast,
Sveden, go to sea. Ain't nutting else for dem to do. My fa'der die on
board ship in Indian Ocean. He's buried at sea. Ay don't never know him
only little bit. Den my tree bro'der, older'n me, dey go on ships. Den
Ay go, too. Den my mo'der she's left all 'lone. She die pooty quick
after dat--all 'lone. Ve vas all avay on voyage when she die. Two my bro'der dey gat lost on fishing boat same like
your bro'ders vas drowned. My oder bro'der, he save money, give up sea,
den he die home in bed. He's only one dat ole davil don't kill.
But me, Ay bet you Ay die ashore in bed, too!

Were all of 'em yust plain sailors?

CHEIS--Able body seaman, most of dem. Dey vas
all smart seaman, too--A one. Ay vas bo'sun.

Bo'sun?

Dat's kind of officer.

Gee, that was fine. What does he do?

Hard vork all time. It's rotten, Ay tal you,

Dey're all fool fallar, dem fallar in our family. Dey all vork rotten

But say--listen--did all the women of the family marry
sailors?
