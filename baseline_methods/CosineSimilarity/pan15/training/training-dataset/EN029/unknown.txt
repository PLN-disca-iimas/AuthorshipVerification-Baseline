       Hurrah, hurrah, for Santa Claus so dear,
           Sure, it was a happy night,
           The best one in the year.
       And we'll be marching on Christmas.

     Nora got a picture-book, Melissa got a rake,
     Every Mulligan on deck got oranges and cake,
     Got a bag of candy, too--and got the stomachache,
       But we'll be marching on Christmas.

       Hurrah, hurrah, the Mulligans are here,
       Hurrah, hurrah, for Santa Claus so dear,
           Sure, it was a happy night,
           The best one in the year.
       And we'll be marching on Christmas.

And did ye have a good time at the entertainment?

Indade and we did that. It was as good as a circus parade and
a picture show together. They treated us just lovely.

Did they now? And you wasn't invited at all, at all.

They gave us a seat way up in front, and Micky Machree acted
like a pig, he did. Sure, he grabbed two oranges.

Why, Micky, it's ashamed of ye I am.

I grabbed one to bring home to you, maw. I wanted you to have
some of the Christmas present, too.

That's just like your father, Micky.

And did ye have a good time, wee Peter Pan?

 Scwumptious, just scwumptious.

And me sash niver busted in two at all. And I was one of the
most stylish young ladies present, so I was.

And they had a great, big Christmas tree. Clean up to the
ceiling. With lights and toys and candy and little stars and bright
fairies and angels and everything.

And ould Santy Claus was there with a long white beard and a
big pack of presents to everyone.

And I pulled Santa Claus' whiskers and they nearly fell off.
He must be getting pretty old, 'cause his whiskers is coming loose.

 And Santy Claus called out all the names and everybody got up
when their names was called and he gave 'em a present.

And they never called our names at all, at all.
