Well, I haf just one shilling now!

I say, what's your name?

May.  Well, I call myself that.  It is no good asking yours.

 You're a distrustful little soul; aren't you?

I haf reason to be, don't you think?

Yes.  I suppose you're bound to think us all brutes.

Well, I haf a lot of reasons to be
afraid all my time.  I am dreadfully nervous now; I am not trusding
anybody.  I suppose you haf been killing lots of Germans?

We never know, unless it happens to be hand to hand; I
haven't come in for that yet.

But you would be very glad if you had killed some.

Oh, glad?  I don't think so.  We're all in the same boat,
so far as that's concerned.  We're not glad to kill each other--not
most of us.  We do our job--that's all.

Oh!  It is frightful.  I expect I haf my brothers killed.

Don't you get any news ever?

News?  No indeed, no news of anybody in my country.  I might
not haf a country; all that I ever knew is gone; fader, moder,
sisters, broders, all;  never any more I shall see them, I suppose,
now.  The war it breaks and breaks, it breaks hearts.  [She gives a
little snarl]  Do you know what I was thinking when you came up to
me?  I was thinking of my native town, and the river in the
moonlight.  If I could see it again I would be glad.  Were you ever
homeseeck?

Yes, I have been--in the trenches.  But one's ashamed
with all the others.

Ah!  Yees!  Yees!  You are all comrades there.  What is it
like for me here, do you think, where everybody hates and despises
me, and would catch me and put me in prison, perhaps.  [Her breast
heaves.]

Sorry--sorry.
