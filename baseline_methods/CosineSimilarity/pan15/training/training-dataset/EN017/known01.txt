It's a wonder you wouldn't stop this machine grinding
itself to bits, Mr. Murray.

 I was hoping the darn thing would bust. It keeps you from
talking to me. That's the real music.

 It's easy to see you've got Irish in you. Do you know what I think? I think you're a
natural born kidder. All newspaper reporters are like that, I've heard.

You wrong me terribly. And it isn't
charitable to remind me of my job. I hoped to forget all about it up
here.

I think it's great to be able to write. I
wish I could. You ought to be proud of it.

I'm not. You can't call it writing--not what I
did--small town stuff. But I wanted to ask
you something. Do you know when I'm to be moved away to the huts?

In a few days, I guess. Don't be impatient. What's the matter? Don't
you like us here at the Sanatorium?

Oh--you--yes!  I don't care for
the atmosphere, though. All those people in bed out there on the
porch seem so sick. It's depressing. I can't do anything for
them--and--it makes me feel so helpless.

 Well, it's the rules, you know. All the patients have to
come here first until Doctor Stanton finds out whether they're well
enough to be sent out to the huts and cottages. And remember you're a
patient just like the ones in bed out there--even if you are up and
about.

I know it. But I don't feel as I were--really sick like them.

None of them do, either.

 Yes, I suppose it's
that pipe dream that keeps us all going, eh?

Well, you ought to be thankful. You're very lucky, if you
knew it. Shall I tell you a secret? I've seen
your chart and _you've_ no cause to worry. Doctor Stanton joked about
it. He said you were too uninteresting--there was so little the matter
with you.
