I've heard Old Chris
talkin' about your bein' a nurse girl out there. Was that all a bluff
yuh put up when yuh wrote him?

Not on your life, it wasn't. It was true for two years. I didn't
go wrong all at one jump. Being a nurse girl was yust what finished me.
Taking care of other people's kids, always listening to their bawling
and crying, caged in, when you're only a kid yourself and want to go
out and see things. At last I got the chance--to get into that house.
And you bet your life I took it!  And I ain't sorry
neither.  It was all men's
fault--the whole business. It was men on the farm ordering and beating
me--and giving me the wrong start. Then when I was a nurse, it was men
again hanging around, bothering me, trying to see what they could get.
 And now it's men all the time. Gawd, I hate
'em all, every mother's son of 'em! Don't you?

Oh, I dunno. There's good ones and bad ones, kid. You've just
had a run of bad luck with 'em, that's all. Your Old Man, now--old
Chris--he's a good one.

He'll have to show me.

Yuh kept right on writing him yuh was a nurse girl still, even
after yuh was in the house, didn't yuh?

Sure. Not that I think he'd care a darn.

Yuh're all wrong about him, kid, I know Old Chris
well for a long time. He's talked to me 'bout you lots o' times. He
thinks the world o' you, honest he does.

Aw, quit the kiddin'!

Honest! Only, he's a simple old guy, see? He's got nutty
notions. But he means well, honest. Listen to me, kid-- Ssshh!

What's up?

Py
golly, Larry, dat grub taste good. Marthy in back?

Sure--and another tramp with her. [CHRIS starts for the entrance
to the back room.]

That's him now. He's
comin' in here. Brace up!

Who? 

Why hello, Old Chris.  Come here. I wanta tell yuh
somethin'. Listen! I'm goin' to beat it down to the barge--pack up me duds and
blow. That's her in there--your Anna--just come--waitin' for yuh. Treat
her right, see? She's been sick. Well, s'long!  S'long, kid. I gotta beat it now. See yuh later.
