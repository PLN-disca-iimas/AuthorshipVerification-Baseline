It is arranged  that, until it is decided which of us two is the actual King, we  are to act as one person.Exactly.Now, although we act as one person, we are, in point of fact, two persons.Ah, I dont think we can go into that.  It is a  legal fiction, and legal fictions are solemn things.  Situated as  we are, we cant recognize two independent responsibilities. No; but you can recognize two independent appetites.  Its all very well to say we act as one person, but when you  supply us with only one ration between us, I should describe it  as a legal fiction carried a little too far. Its rather a nice point.  I dont like to express an  opinion off-hand.  Suppose we reserve it for argument before the  full Court? Yes, but what are we to do in the meantime?We want our tea.I think we may make an interim order for double  rations on their Majesties entering into the usual undertaking to  indemnify in the event of an adverse decision?That, I think, will meet the case.  But you must work  hard--stick to it--nothing like work.Oh, certainly.  We quite understand that a man who  holds the magnificent position of King should do something to  justify it.  We are called \"Your Majesty\"; we are allowed to buy  ourselves magnificent clothes; our subjects frequently nod to us  in the streets; the sentries always return our salutes; and we  enjoy the inestimable privilege of heading the subscription lists  to all the principal charities.

I am now about to address myself to the gentleman  whom my daughter married; the other may allow his attention to  wander if he likes, for what I am about to say does not concern  him.  Sir, you will find in this young lady a combination of  excellences which you would search for in vain in any young lady  who had not the good fortune to be my daughter.  There is some  little doubt as to which of you is the gentleman I am addressing,  and which is the gentleman who is allowing his attention to  wander; but when that doubt is solved, I shall say , \"Take her, and may she make  you happier than her mother has made me.\"     Sir!    If possible.  And now there is a little matter to  which I think I am entitled to take exception.  I come here in  state with Her Grace the Duchess and Her Majesty my daughter, and  what do I find?  Do I find, for instance, a guard of honour to  receive me?  No!    No.    The town illuminated?  No!    No.       Refreshment provided?  No!   No.    A Royal salute fired?  No!     No. Triumphal arches erected?  No!No.The bells set ringing? No. Yes--one--the Visitors, and I rang it myself.  It is  not enough!  It is not enough!Upon my honour, Im very sorry; but you see, I was  brought up in a gondola, and my ideas of politeness are confined  to taking off my cap to my passengers when they tip me.Thats all very well in its way, but it is not enough."]}
