	Of life, alas! his leave he's taking,
            For ah! his faithful heart is breaking;
            When he is gone we'll surely tell
            The maid that, as he died, he loved her well.

  

	           Be warned, my messmates all
                        Who love in rank above you--
                      For Josephine I fall!

        
                        

                    Ah! stay your hand--I love you!

                    Ah! stay your hand--she loves you!

   			 Loves me? Loves you!

                  Yes, yes--ah, yes,--she loves you!

                             
                           Oh joy, oh rapture unforeseen,
                           For now the sky is all serene;
                           The god of day--the orb of love--
                           Has hung his ensign high above,
                                The sky is all ablaze.

                           With wooing words and loving song,
                           We'll chase the lagging hours along,
 			And if {I find  } the maiden coy,
                                   we find
                           I'll } murmur forth decorous joy
                           We'll
                                In dreamy roundelays!

                                   

                           He thinks he's won his Josephine,
                           But though the sky is now serene,
                           A frowning thunderbolt above
                           May end their ill-assorted love
                                Which now is all ablaze.

                           Our captain, ere the day is gone,
                           Will be extremely down upon
                           The wicked men who art employ
                           To make his Josephine less coy
                                In many various ways.   

                     This very night,

                    With bated breath

                     And muffled oar--

                       Without a light,

                     As still as death,

                    We'll steal ashore

                      A clergyman

                    Shall make us one

                      At half-past ten,

                     And then we can

                     Return, for none

                     Can part them then!

                      This very night, etc.

                       

 	   Forbear, nor carry out the scheme you've planned;
          She is a lady--you a foremast hand!
          Remember, she's your gallant captain's daughter,
          And you the meanest slave that crawls the water!

                     Back, vermin, back,
                             Nor mock us!
                           Back, vermin, back,
                             You shock us!
                                                        

          Let's give three cheers for the sailor's bride
          Who casts all thought of rank aside--
          Who gives up home and fortune too
          For the honest love of a sailor true!
                 For a British tar is a soaring soul
                   As free as a mountain bird!
                 His energetic fist should be ready to resist
                   A dictatorial word!
          His foot should stamp and his throat should growl,
          His hair should twirl and his face should scowl,
          His eyes should flash and his breast protrude,
          And this should be his customary attitude--.
