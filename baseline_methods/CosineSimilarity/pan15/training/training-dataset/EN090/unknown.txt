God!  What beauty!

Umm?

I said: God!  What beauty!

Aha!

Do you know that I have to repeat everything to you nowadays?

What?

That I have to repeat----

Yes; I heard.  I'm sorry.  I get absorbed.

In all but me.

My dear, your song was helping me like anything to
get the mood.  This paper is the very deuce--to balance between the
historical and the natural.

Who wants the natural?

 Umm!  Wish I thought that!  Modern taste!
History may go hang; they're all for tuppence-coloured sentiment
nowadays.

Is the Spring sentiment?

I beg your pardon, my dear; I didn't catch.

Beauty, beauty!

That's what I'm, trying to say here.  The Orpheus legend
symbolizes to this day the call of Beauty! Dash
it!  I get so sleepy; I wish you'd tell them to make the after-dinner
coffee twice as strong.

I will.

How does this strike you? "Many Renaissance
pictures, especially those of Botticelli, Francesca and Piero di
Cosimo were inspired by such legends as that of Orpheus, and we owe a
tiny gem--like Raphael 'Apollo and Marsyas' to the same Pagan
inspiration."

We owe it more than that--rebellion against the dry-as-dust.

Quite.  I might develop that: "We owe it our revolt against
the academic; or our disgust at 'big business,' and all the grossness
of commercial success.  We owe----".

It--love.

PROF.  [Abstracted]  Eh!

I said: We owe it love.

Possibly.  But--er I mustn't say that here--hardly!

Orpheus with his lute!

Most people think a lute is a sort of flute. My dear, if you're not going to sing again, d'you mind
sitting down?  I want to concentrate.

I'm going out.

Mind the dew!

The Christian virtues and the dew.

Not bad!  Not bad!  The Christian
virtues and the dew. "How far we can trace the modern resurgence against the Christian
virtues to the symbolic figures of Orpheus, Pan, Apollo, and Bacchus
might be difficult to estimate, but----"

   
She'll get her throat bad. Sounds queer at night-H'm! 
   

What's that girl's name?

Vanessa Hellgrove.

Aha!
