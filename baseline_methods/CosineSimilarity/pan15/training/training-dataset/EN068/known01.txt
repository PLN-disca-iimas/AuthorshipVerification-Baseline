Serve ye right, ye old divil--havin' a woman
at your age!

You tal me lie for tal
Marthy, Larry, so's she gat off barge quick.

She knows your daughter's comin'. Tell her to get the hell out
of it.

No. Ay don't like make her feel bad.

You're an old mush! Keep your girl away from the barge, then.
She'll likely want to stay ashore anyway.  What does she
work at, your Anna?

She stay on dem cousins' farm 'till two year ago. Dan she gat
yob nurse gel in St. Paul.  But Ay
don't vant for her gat yob now. Ay vant for her stay with me.

On a coal barge! She'll not like that, I'm
thinkin'.

Don't I get that bucket o' suds,
Dutchy?

Yes, Ay come, Marthy.

Now
you're in for it! You'd better tell her straight to get out!

Py golly. 
Marthy--

Wha's that?  I'm wise to what's in back of
your nut, Dutchy. Yuh want to git rid o' me, huh?--now she's comin'.
Gimme the bum's rush ashore, huh? Lemme tell yuh, Dutchy, there ain't a
square-head workin' on a boat man enough to git away with that. Don't
start nothin' yuh can't finish!

Ay don't start nutting, Marthy.

Ho-ho! Yuh're a scream, Square-head--an honest-ter-Gawd
knockout! Ho-ho! 

Ay don't see nutting for laugh at.

Take a slant in the mirror and yuh'll see. Ho-ho!  A square-head tryin' to kid
Marthy Owen at this late day!--after me campin' with barge men the last
twenty years. I'm wise to the game, up, down, and sideways. I ain't
been born and dragged up on the water front for nothin'. Think I'd make
trouble, huh? Not me! I'll pack up me duds an' beat it. I'm quittin'
yuh, get me? I'm tellin' yuh I'm sick of stickin' with yuh, and I'm
leavin' yuh flat, see? There's plenty of other guys on other barges
waitin' for me. Always was, I always found. So cheer up, Dutchy! I'll be offen the barge before
she comes. You'll be rid o' me for good--and me o' you--good riddance
for both of us. Ho-ho!
