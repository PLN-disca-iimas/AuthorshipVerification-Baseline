      After that we generally
       Go and dress our private valet--
       (It's a rather nervous duty--he's a touchy little man)--
       Write some letters literary
       For our private secretary--
       He is shaky in his spelling, so we help him if we can.
       Then, in view of cravings inner,
       We go down and order dinner;
       Then we polish the Regalia and the Coronation Plate--
       Spend an hour in titivating
       All our Gentlemen-in-Waiting;
       Or we run on little errands for the Ministers of State.

       Oh, philosophers may sing
       Of the troubles of a King;
       Yet the duties are delightful, and the privileges great;
       But the privilege and pleasure
       That we treasure beyond measure
       Is to run on little errands for the Ministers of State.

 Oh, philosophers may sing, etc.

  After luncheon 
       If we've nothing in particular to do,
  We may make a Proclamation,
  Or receive a deputation--
       Then we possibly create a Peer or two.
  Then we help a fellow-creature on his path
  With the Garter or the Thistle or the Bath,
  Or we dress and toddle off in semi-state
  To a festival, a function, or a fete.
       Then we go and stand as sentry
       At the Palace (private entry),
       Marching hither, marching thither, up and down and to and
  fro,
       While the warrior on duty
       Goes in search of beer and beauty
       (And it generally happens that he hasn't far to go).
       He relieves us, if he's able,
       Just in time to lay the table,
       Then we dine and serve the coffee, and at half-past twelve
  or one,
       With a pleasure that's emphatic,
  We retire to our attic
       With the gratifying feeling that our duty has been done!

       Oh, philosophers may sing
       Of the troubles of a King,
       But of pleasures there are many and of worries there are
  none;
       And the culminating pleasure
       That we treasure beyond measure
       Is the gratifying feeling that our duty has been done!
