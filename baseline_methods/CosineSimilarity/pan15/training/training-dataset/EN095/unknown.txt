I am the last person to insult a British sailor, Sir Joseph.

You are the last person who did, Captain Corcoran. Desire
that splendid seaman to step forward.

                          
No, no, the other splendid seaman.

Ralph Rackstraw, three paces to the front--march!

If what?

I beg your pardon--I don't think I understand you.

If you please.

Oh, yes, of course. If you please.

You're a remarkably fine fellow.

 Yes, your honour.

And a first-rate seaman, I'll be bound.

There's not a smarter topman in the Navy, your honour, though I
 say it who shouldn't.

Not at all. Proper self-respect, nothing more. Can you
dance a hornpipe?

No, your honour.

That's a pity: all sailors should dance hornpipes. I will
  teach you one this evening, after dinner. Now tell me--don't be
  afraid-- how does your captain treat you, eh?

A better captain don't walk the deck, your honour.

Aye; Aye!

 Good. I like to hear you speak well of your commanding
  officer; I daresay he don't deserve it, but still it does you
  credit. Can you sing?

I can hum a little, your honour.

Then hum this at your leisure. It is a song that I have composed for the use of the Royal Navy. 
It is designed to encourage independence of thought and action in the
 lower branches of the service, and to teach the principle that a  British sailor
  is any man's equal, excepting mine. Now, Captain Corcoran, a word with
  you in your cabin, on a tender and sentimental subject.

Aye, aye,

    Sir Joseph Boatswain, in commemoration of this joyous
  occasion, see that extra grog is served out to the ship's company
  at seven bells.

Beg pardon. If what, your honour?

If what? I don't think I understand you.

If you please, your honour.

What!

The gentleman is quite right. If you please.

 If you please!
