I'm just going to start on a journey to the Wishing Land.
The toys there are awfully big. They'd be just the right size for
you. Would you like to go with me?

Is it very far?

Could we get back by bedtime?

Wouldn't it be awfully cold flying through the air?

Oh, no. We'd fly so fast you'd only have time to shiver
once and then we'd be right there.

Oh, yes; let's go.

 All right. Now all of you part your hair right in the
middle, so you won't be heavier on one side than on the other.
That's good. Now give me your hands and hold on tight and
we're off to the Wishing Land. Follow me, full of glee.

 Well, here we are in the Wishing Land. My kingdom and not
a soul to welcome me!

 Oh, what a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful place.

See 'ittie bitsy teeny weeny trumpets gwowing in twees.

And the dolls. The lovely, lovely dolls.

What, ho! Is there none to welcome me?
Oh, see the Teddy Bear.

And he's the biggest one I ever saw.

Nice pussy, nice, nice pussy! 

T Oh, naughty, naughty, naughty!

Hello, Teddy Bear. Where's your brother?

 Go out and find him for me. Have you been a very, very good Teddy Bear while I was away?

That's good. Now go out and find Jimmy Bear.

 Everything is growing fine. I think
the bicycle trees need a little more water. Well, children, what do
you think of the Wishing Land?

It's awfully pretty.

It's perfectly gorgeous.

Wunnerful, simply wunnerful.

Here's where I grow my toys. See, there is the trumpet
vine, and the candy tree and the dolly flowers. Whenever a little
child makes a wish for anything like that, all I have to do is to come
in here and pick a toy. See?
