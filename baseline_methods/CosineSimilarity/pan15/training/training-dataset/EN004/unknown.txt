     It turns the night to day, it shines so bright
     I am afraid! It cannot be that any star,
     Only a star, can give so great a light.
     It frightens me.


     All things are strange tonight.
     The very sheep are restless in their fold,
     They watch the star and do not mind the cold.

     Again I heard a singing in the sky!


     You heard the tinkling bell of some stray sheep,
     The night grows late, come let us all to sleep.

   

  Yea, all ye lie down and take your rest,
     I'll keep the watch alone, this night is blest.


     Here, take the little sheep and keep it warm.

     Poor little new-born beast, I'll guard from harm.
     Again I marvel that you should be born
     On such a night, poor little lamb forlorn.


The Lord is my shepherd: I shall not want.

He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the
still waters.

He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for
his name's sake.

Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will
fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort
me.

Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou
anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and
I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever.


     Hark! There's music in the wind! And that strange light
     There in the east, it brightens all the night!
     I seem to hear again the whir of wings,
     Awake, awake! It is an angel sings!

     Glory to God in the highest!
         Fear not!
     For behold I bring you glad tidings
         Of great joy.
     For unto you is born this day
     In the city of David, a Saviour
