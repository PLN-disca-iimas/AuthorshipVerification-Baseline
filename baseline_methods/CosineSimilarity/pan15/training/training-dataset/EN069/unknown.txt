 Mush!  Indade and I will ask your pardon a thousand
times--and on my knees, if ye like. I didn't mean a word of what I said
or did. But divil a woman in all the
ports of the world has iver made a great fool of me that way before!

I see. You mean you're a lady-killer and
they all fall for you.

Leave off your fooling! 'Tis that is
after getting my back up at you. 'Tis no lie I'm telling
you about the women. Though it's a great jackass I am to be
mistaking you, even in anger, for the like of them cows on the
waterfront is the only women I've met up with since I was growed to a
man. I'm a hard, rough man and I'm not fit, I'm thinking, to be kissing the
shoe-soles of a fine, dacent girl the like of yourself. 'Tis only the
ignorance of your kind made me see you wrong. So you'll forgive me, for
the love of God, and let us be friends from this out. 
I'm thinking I'd rather be friends with you than have my wish for
anything else in the world. 

Sure.

God bless you! 

Ouch!

Your pardon, Miss. 'Tis a
clumsy ape I am. It's
great power I have in my hand and arm, and I do be forgetting it at
times.

Gee, you're some strong, all right.

It's no lie, and why shouldn't I be, with me
shoveling a million tons of coal in the stokeholes of ships since I was
a lad only. Let you sit down,
now, Miss, and I'll be telling you a bit of myself, and you'll be
telling me a bit of yourself, and in an hour we'll be as old friends as
if we was born in the same house. Sit
down now, if you plaze.

Well--But we won't talk
about me, see? You tell me about yourself and about the wreck.

I'll tell you, surely. But can I be asking you one
question. Miss, has my head in a puzzle?

Well--I dunno--what is it?

What is it you do when you're not taking a trip with the Old
Man? For I'm thinking a fine girl the like of you ain't living always
on this tub.
