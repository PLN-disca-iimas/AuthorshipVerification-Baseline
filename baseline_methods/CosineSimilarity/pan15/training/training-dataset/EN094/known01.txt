 Yes, yes, Jarvis--quite--quite right!

Yes, sir.  I've--I've got a 'abit that way at my time o'
life.

 How long have they been here, Jarvis?

 Well---er--a matter of three weeks, m'm.


  Of course, in my profession I can't afford to take
notice of whether there's the trifle of a ring between 'em, as the
sayin' is.  'Tisn't 'ardly my business like.


Er--thank you, Jarvis; you needn't wait.

 No, m'lady.  Your service, sir--service, m'm.


 Three weeks?  I say--er--
wasn't there a book?

Three weeks----I certainly haven't seen them in church.

 A trifle of a ring!

 Oh, bother!  I'm sure she's all right. And if she isn't, I don't care.  She's been much too splendid.

Must think of the village.  Didn't quite like the doctor's way of puttin' us off.

The poor darling owes his life to her.

H'm!  Dash it!  Yes!  Can't forget the way she ran into
that stinkin' pond.

Had she a wedding-ring on?

Well, I'm not going to be ungrateful.

It'd be dashed awkward--mustn't take a false step, Ella.

 And I've got his braces! 

Bertie!

That's all right, Rector--we're goin' to be perfectly
polite, and--and--thank her, and all that.

We can see she's a good sort.  What does it matter?

My dear Ella!  "What does it matter!"  We've got to know.

 We do want light.

 I'll ring the bell. 

What did you ring for, Tommy?

  God knows!

 Somebody'll come.

 Rector--you--you've got to----

 Yes, Bertie.

 Dear me!  But--er--what--er----How?

The whole thing's damn delicate.

 
 Er--er----your master is not in?

No.  'E's gone up to London.

 Er----Mr Challenger, I think?

Yes.

Yes!  Er----quite so

D'you want--Mrs Challenger?

Ah! Not precisely----

Go on.

 I asked because there was a--a--Mr. Challenger I used to know in the 'nineties, and I thought--you
wouldn't happen to know how long they've been married?  My friend
marr----

Three weeks.

Quite so--quite so!  I shall hope it will turn out to
be----Er--thank you--Ha!

  Our dog has been fighting with the Rector's, and Mrs
Challenger rescued him;  she's bathing his ear.  We're waiting to
thank her.  You needn't----

 No.
