Guess we can't take liberties with our public, Mr Vane.  They
want pep.

But it'll break that girl's heart.  I--really--I can't----

Give her the part of the 'tweeny in "Pop goes".

 Mr Frust, I--I beg.  I've taken a lot of trouble with this
little play.  It's good.  It's that girl's chance--and I----

We-ell!  I certainly thought she was fine.  Now, you 'phone
up Miggs, and get right along with it.  I've only one rule, sir!
Give the Public what it wants; and what the Public wants is punch and
go.  They've got no use for Beauty, Allegory, all that high-brow
racket.  I know 'em as I know my hand.

 Mr Frost, the Public would take this, I'm sure they would; I'm
convinced of it.  You underrate them.

Now, see here, Mr Blewitt Vane, is this my theatre?  I tell
you, I can't afford luxuries.

But it--it moved you, sir; I saw it.  I was watching.

 Mr Vane, I judge I'm not the average
man.  Before "Louisa Loses" the Public'll want a stimulant.  "Pop
goes the Weasel" will suit us fine.  So--get right along with it.
I'll go get some lunch.

Damnation!

Sir?

"Punch and go!" That superstition!

Mr Foreson!

 Sir?

This is scrapped. Tell 'em to set the first act of "Louisa Loses," and put some pep into it.


Electrics!

Hallo!

Where's Charlie?

Gone to his dinner.

Anybody on the curtain?

Yes, Mr Foreson.

Put your curtain down.
