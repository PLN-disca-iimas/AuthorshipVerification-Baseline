Now let the loyal lieges gather round--
            The Prince's foster-mother has been found!
            She will declare, to silver clarion's sound,
            The rightful King--let him forthwith be crowned!

       She will declare, etc.

 
    Speak, woman, speak--

       We're all attention!

   The news we seek-

         This moment mention.

    To us they bring--

        His foster-mother.

      Is he the King?

          Or this my brother?

    Speak, woman, speak, etc.

                          

            The Royal Prince was by the King entrusted
            To my fond care, ere I grew old and crusted;
            When traitors came to steal his son reputed,
            My own small boy I deftly substituted!
            The villains fell into the trap completely--
            I hid the Prince away--still sleeping sweetly:
            I called him "son" with pardonable slyness--
            His name, Luiz!  Behold his Royal Highness!

 Luiz!

Casilda! 

Get out, sir! 

 A hit, sir?

Take that, sir!

It's tit, sir,

For tat, sir!


        When two doughty heroes thunder,
        All the world is lost in wonder;
              When such men their temper lose,
              Awful are the words they use!

Tall snobs, small snobs, rich snobs and needy ones!

Whom are you alluding to?

Where are you intruding to?

 Fat snobs, thin snobs, swell snobs and seedy ones!

I rather think you err.
        To whom do you refer?

To you, sir!

To me, sir?

 I do, sir!

We'll see, sir!

 I jeer, sir! Grimace, sir!

Look here, sir-- A face, sir!


        When two heroes, once pacific,
        Quarrel, the effect's terrific!
              What a horrible grimace!
              What a paralysing face!

Big bombs, small bombs, etc.

He has insulted me, and, in a breath, This day we fight a duel to the death!

You mean, of course, by duel A Statutory Duel.

Why, what's that?
