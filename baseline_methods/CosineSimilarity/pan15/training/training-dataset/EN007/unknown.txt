Whoa, there, Jimmie! Oh, Grandpa, I do love my pony. It's the best of all my presents.

Well, it's time you put him in his stall.

I'm going to call my pony after Mr. ----.
'Cause he looks just like him.

And what are you going to call your pony, Snookums?

Going to call him Elizabeth, after you, Grandma.

That's my baby!

Grandma, we'd better get our hats and coats. It's nearly time for the car to be after us.

Come, Grandpa. It's nearly eight o'clock.

But I don't like to leave the children.

And we don't like to have you leave us, either. My, this has
been the grandest Christmas day I've ever seen.

Come, Grandma. 

Come, children. I'm glad you've had such a happy Christmas. You got everything you wanted, didn't you?

Yes, everything. My, I wish Christmas would come every day.

Tell us the story about old Saint Nick, Grandpa.

Do you want to hear that old chestnut again?

Oh, yes, yes!

Oh, that was just lovely.

I just wish I could see him. Just once!

And so do I. I'm going to catch him some Christmas Eve.

Me, too!
Here, Grandpa, put on your coat and hat, or we'll be late for the dinner.

I'd rather stay here and talk to the children.

But Aunt Clara is expecting us.

And the auto is at the door.

Dumpling, are you sure you got everything you wanted for Christmas?

I can't think of anything else.

If you didn't, and if all three of you children can agree on
anything else, it shall be yours if money can buy it.

Money can buy everything, can't it, Grandpa?

No, my dear, not quite everything.

 But suppose we wish for something that money can't buy?

I'd try to get it for you some other way.
