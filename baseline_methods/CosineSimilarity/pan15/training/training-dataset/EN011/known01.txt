Not for mine. I'm full up. And you-- Had
anythin' to eat lately?

Not since this morning on the train.

Then yuh better go easy on it, hadn't yuh?

Guess you're right. I got to meet
someone, too. But my nerves is on edge after that rotten trip.

Yuh said yuh was just outa the hospital?

Two weeks ago.  The joint
I was in out in St. Paul got raided. That was the start. The judge give
all us girls thirty days. The others didn't seem to mind being in the
cooler much. Some of 'em was used to it. But me, I couldn't stand it.
It got my goat right--couldn't eat or sleep or nothing. I never could
stand being caged up nowheres. I got good and sick and they had to send
me to the hospital. It was nice there. I was sorry to leave it, honest!

Did yuh say yuh got to meet someone
here?

Yes. Oh, not what you mean. It's my Old Man I got to meet.
Honest! It's funny, too. I ain't seen him since I was a kid--don't even
know what he looks like--yust had a letter every now and then. This was
always the only address he give me to write him back. He's yanitor of
some building here now--used to be a sailor.

Janitor!

Sure. And I was thinking maybe, seeing he ain't never done a
thing for me in my life, he might be willing to stake me to a room and
eats till I get rested up. Gee, I sure need that rest! I'm
knocked out. But I ain't expecting much from him.
Give you a kick when you're down, that's what all men do. Men, I hate 'em--all of 'em! And I don't expect he'll turn
out no better than the rest. Say, do you
hang out around this dump much?

Oh, off and on.

Then maybe you know him--my Old Man--or at least seen him?

It ain't old Chris, is it?

Old Chris?

Chris Christopherson, his full name is.

Yes, that's him! Anna Christopherson--that's my real
name--only out there I called myself Anna Christie. So you know him, eh?

Seen him about for years.

Say, what's he like, tell me, honest?

Oh, he's short and--
