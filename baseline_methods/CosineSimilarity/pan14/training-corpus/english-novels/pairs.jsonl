{"id": "EN068", "pair": ["III. A Search and an Evocation1.Charles Ward, as we have seen, first learned in 1918 of his descent from Joseph Curwen. That he at once took an intense interest in everything pertaining to the bygone mystery is not to be wondered at; for every vague rumour that he had heard of Curwen now became something vital to himself, in whom flowed Curwens blood. No spirited and imaginative genealogist could have done otherwise than begin forthwith an avid and systematic collection of Curwen data.      In his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at secrecy; so that even Dr. Lyman hesitates to date the youths madness from any period before the close of 1919. He talked freely with his family - though his mother was not particularly pleased to own an ancestor like Curwen - and with the officials of the various museums and libraries he visited. In applying to private families for records thought to be in their possession he made no concealment of his object, and shared the somewhat amused scepticism with which the accounts of the old diarists and letter-writers were regarded. He often expressed a keen wonder as to what really had taken place a century and a half before at that Pawtuxet farmhouse whose site he vainly tried to find, and what Joseph Curwen really had been.      When he came across the Smith diary and archives and encountered the letter from Jedediah Orne he decided to visit Salem and look up Curwens early activities and connexions there, which he did during the Easter vacation of 1919. At the Essex Institute, which was well known to him from former sojourns in the glamorous old town of crumbling Puritan gables and clustered gambrel roofs, he was very kindly received, and unearthed there a considerable amount of Curwen data. He found that his ancestor was born in Salem-Village, now Danvers, seven miles from town, on the eighteenth of February (O.S.) 1662-3; and that he had run away to sea at the age of fifteen, not appearing again for nine years, when he returned with the speech, dress, and manners of a native Englishman and settled in Salem proper. At that time he had little to do with his family, but spent most of his hours with the curious books he had brought from Europe, and the strange chemicals which came for him on ships from England, France, and Holland. Certain trips of his into the country were the objects of much local inquisitiveness, and were whisperingly associated with vague rumours of fires on the hills at night.      Curwens only close friends had been one Edward Hutchinson of Salem-Village and one Simon Orne of Salem. With these men he was often seen in conference about the Common, and visits among them were by no means infrequent. Hutchinson had a house well out toward the woods, and it was not altogether liked by sensitive people because of the sounds heard there at night. He was said to entertain strange visitors, and the lights seen from his windows were not always of the same colour. The knowledge he displayed concerning long-dead persons and long-forgotten events was considered distinctly unwholesome, and he disappeared about the time the witchcraft panic began, never to be heard from again. At that time Joseph Curwen also departed, but his settlement in Providence was soon learned of. Simon Orne lived in Salem until 1720, when his failure to grow visibly old began to excite attention. He thereafter disappeared, though thirty years later his precise counterpart and self-styled son turned up to claim his property. The claim was allowed on the strength of documents in Simon Ornes known hand, and Jedediah Orne continued to dwell in Salem till 1771, when certain letters from Providence citizens to the Rev. Thomas Barnard and others brought about his quiet removal to parts unknown.      Certain documents by and about all of these strange characters were available at the Essex Institute, the Court House, and the Registry of Deeds, and included both harmless commonplaces such as land titles and bills of sale, and furtive fragments of a more provocative nature. There were four or five unmistakable allusions to them on the witchcraft trial records; as when one Hepzibah Lawson swore on July 10, 1692, at the Court of Oyer and Terminer under Judge Hathorne, that fortie Witches and the Blacke Man were wont to meete in the Woodes behind Mr. Hutchinsons house, and one Amity How declared at a session of August 8th before Judge Gedney that Mr. G. B. (Rev. George Burroughs) on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B. Then there was a catalogue of Hutchinsons uncanny library as found after his disappearance, and an unfinished manuscript in his handwriting, couched in a cipher none could read. Ward had a photostatic copy of this manuscript made, and began to work casually on the cipher as soon as it was delivered to him. After the following August his labours on the cipher became intense and feverish, and there is reason to believe from his speech and conduct that he hit upon the key before October or November. He never stated, though, whether or not he had succeeded.      But of the greatest immediate interest was the Orne material. It took Ward only a short time to prove from identity of penmanship a thing he had already considered established from the text of the letter to Curwen; namely, that Simon Orne and his supposed son were one and the same person. As Orne had said to his correspondent, it was hardly safe to live too long in Salem, hence he resorted to a thirty-year sojourn abroad, and did not return to claim his lands except as a representative of a new generation. Orne had apparently been careful to destroy most of his correspondence, but the citizens who took action in 1771 found and preserved a few letters and papers which excited their wonder. There were cryptic formulae and diagrams in his and other hands which Ward now either copied with care or had photographed, and one extremely mysterious letter in a chirography that the searcher recognised from items in the Registry of Deeds as positively Joseph Curwens.      This Curwen letter, though undated as to the year, was evidently not the one in answer to which Orne had written the confiscated missive; and from internal evidence Ward placed it not much later than 1750. It may not be amiss to give the text in full, as a sample of the style of one whose history was so dark and terrible. The recipient is addressed as \"Simon\", but a line (whether drawn by Curwen or Orne Ward could not tell) is run through the word.Prouidence, I.

This letter, oddly enough, was what first gave Ward the exact location of Curwens Providence home; for none of the records encountered up to that time had been at all specific. The discovery was doubly striking because it indicated as the newer Curwen house built in 1761 on the site of the old, a dilapidated building still standing in Olney Court and well known to Ward in his antiquarian rambles over Stampers Hill. The place was indeed only a few squares from his own home on the great hills higher ground, and was now the abode of a negro family much esteemed for occasional washing, housecleaning, and furnace-tending services. To find, in distant Salem, such sudden proof of the significance of this familiar rookery in his own family history, was a highly impressive thing to Ward; and he resolved to explore the place immediately upon his return. The more mystical phases of the letter, which he took to be some extravagant kind of symbolism, frankly baffled him; though he noted with a thrill of curiosity that the Biblical passage referred to - Job 14, 14 - was the familiar verse, \"If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.\"2.      Young Ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement, and spent the following Saturday in a long and exhaustive study of the house in Olney Court. The place, now crumbling with age, had never been a mansion; but was a modest two-and-a-half story wooden town house of the familiar Providence colonial type, with plain peaked roof, large central chimney, and artistically carved doorway with rayed fanlight, triangular pediment, and trim Doric pilasters. It had suffered but little alteration externally, and Ward felt he was gazing on something very close to the sinister matters of his quest.      The present negro inhabitants were known to him, and he was very courteously shewn about the interior by old Asa and his stout wife Hannah. Here there was more change than the outside indicated, and Ward saw with regret that fully half of the fine scroll-and-urn overmantels and shell-carved cupboard linings were gone, whilst much of the fine wainscotting and bolection moulding was marked, hacked, and gouged, or covered up altogether with cheap wall-paper. In general, the survey did not yield as much as Ward had somehow expected; but it was at least exciting to stand within the ancestral walls which had housed such a man of horror as Joseph Curwen. He saw with a thrill that a monogram had been very carefully effaced from the ancient brass knocker.      From then until after the close of school Ward spent his time on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local Curwen data. The former still proved unyielding; but of the latter he obtained so much, and so many clues to similar data elsewhere, that he was ready by July to make a trip to New London and New York to consult old letters whose presence in those places was indicated. This trip was very fruitful, for it brought him the Fenner letters with their terrible description of the Pawtuxet farmhouse raid, and the Nightingale-Talbot letters in which he learned of the portrait painted on a panel of the Curwen library. This matter of the portrait interested him particularly, since he would have given much to know just what Joseph Curwen looked like; and he decided to make a second search of the house in Olney Court to see if there might not be some trace of the ancient features beneath peeling coats of later paint or layers of mouldy wall-paper.      Early in August that search took place, and Ward went carefully over the walls of every room sizeable enough to have been by any possibility the library of the evil builder. He paid especial attention to the large panels of such overmantels as still remained; and was keenly excited after about an hour, when on a broad area above the fireplace in a spacious ground-floor room he became certain that the surface brought out by the peeling of several coats of paint was sensibly darker than any ordinary interior paint or the wood beneath it was likely to have been. A few more careful tests with a thin knife, and he knew that he had come upon an oil portrait of great extent. With truly scholarly restraint the youth did not risk the damage which an immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture with the knife might have done, but just retired from the scene of his discovery to enlist expert help. In three days he returned with an artist of long experience, Mr. Walter C. Dwight, whose studio is near the foot of College Hill; and that accomplished restorer of paintings set to work at once with proper methods and chemical substances. Old Asa and his wife were duly excited over their strange visitors, and were properly reimbursed for this invasion of their domestic hearth.      As day by day the work of restoration progressed, Charles Ward looked on with growing interest at the lines and shades gradually unveiled after their long oblivion. Dwight had begun at the bottom; hence since the picture was a three-quarter-length one, the face did not come out for some time. It was meanwhile seen that the subject was a spare, well-shaped man with dark-blue coat, embroidered waistcoat, black satin small-clothes, and white silk stockings, seated in a carved chair against the background of a window with wharves and ships beyond. When the head came out it was observed to bear a neat Albemarle wig, and to possess a thin, calm, undistinguished face which seemed somehow familiar to both Ward and the artist. Only at the very last, though, did the restorer and his client begin to gasp with astonishment at the details of that lean, pallid visage, and to recognise with a touch of awe the dramatic trick which heredity had played. For it took the final bath of oil and the final stroke of the delicate scraper to bring out fully the expression which centuries had hidden; and to confront the bewildered Charles Dexter Ward, dweller in the past, with his own living features in the countenance of his horrible great-great-great-grandfather.      Ward brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered, and his father at once determined to purchase the picture despite its execution on stationary panelling. The resemblance to the boy, despite an appearance of rather greater age, was marvellous; and it could be seen that through some trick of atavism the physical contours of Joseph Curwen had found precise duplication after a century and a half. Mrs. Wards resemblance to her ancestor was not at all marked, though she could recall relatives who had some of the facial characteristics shared by her son and by the bygone Curwen. She did not relish the discovery, and told her husband that he had better burn the picture instead of bringing it home. There was, she averred, something unwholesome about it; not only intrinsically, but in its very resemblance to Charles. Mr. Ward, however, was a practical man of power and affairs - a cotton manufacturer with extensive mills at Riverpoint in the Pawtuxet Valley - and not one to listen to feminine scruples. The picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to his son, and he believed the boy deserved it as a present. In this opinion, it is needless to say, Charles most heartily concurred; and a few days later Mr. Ward located the owner of the house - a small rodent-featured person with a guttural accent - and obtained the whole mantel and overmantel bearing the picture at a curtly fixed priced which cut short the impending torrent of unctuous haggling.      It now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the Ward home, where provisions were made for its thorough restoration and installation with an electric mock-fireplace in Charless third-floor study or library. To Charles was left the task of superintending this removal, and on the twenty-eighth of August he accompanied two expert workmen from the Crooker decorating firm to the house in Olney Court, where the mantel and portrait-bearing overmantel were detached with great care and precision for transportation in the companys motor truck. There was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the chimneys course, and in this young Ward observed a cubical recess about a foot square, which must have lain directly behind the head of the portrait. Curious as to what such a space might mean or contain, the youth approached and looked within; finding beneath the deep coatings of dust and soot some loose yellowed papers, a crude, thick copybook, and a few mouldering textile shreds which may have formed the ribbon binding the rest together. Blowing away the bulk of the dirt and cinders, he took up the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover. It was in a hand which he had learned to recognise at the Essex Institute, and proclaimed the volume as the \"Journall and Notes of Jos: Curwen, Gent., of Providence-Plantations, Late of Salem.\"      Excited beyond measure by his discovery, Ward shewed the book to the two curious workmen beside him. Their testimony is absolute as to the nature and genuineness of the finding, and Dr. Willett relies on them to help establish his theory that the youth was not mad when he began his major eccentricities. All the other papers were likewise in Curwens handwriting, and one of them seemed especially portentous because of its inscription: \"To Him Who Shal Come After, & How He May Gett Beyonde Time & ye Spheres.\" Another was in a cipher; the same, Ward hoped, as the Hutchinson cipher which had hitherto baffled him. A third, and here the searcher rejoiced, seemed to be a key to the cipher; whilst the fourth and fifth were addressed respectively to \"Edw: Hutchinson, Armiger\" and \"Jedediah Orne, Esq.\", or Their Heir or Heirs, or Those Representg Them. The sixth and last was inscribed: \"Joseph Curwen his Life and Travells Betn ye yeares 1678 and 1687: Of Whither He Voyagd, Where He Stayd, Whom He Sawe, and What He Learnt.\"3.      We have now reached the point from which the more academic school of alienists date Charles Wards madness. Upon his discovery the youth had looked immediately at a few of the inner pages of the book and manuscripts, and had evidently seen something which impressed him tremendously. Indeed, in shewing the titles to the workmen he appeared to guard the text itself with peculiar care, and to labour under a perturbation for which even the antiquarian and genealogical significance of the find could hardly account. Upon returning home he broke the news with an almost embarrassed air, as if he wished to convey an idea of its supreme importance without having to exhibit the evidence itself. He did not even shew the titles to his parents, but simply told them that he had found some documents in Joseph Curwens handwriting, \"mostly in cipher\", which would have to be studied very carefully before yielding up their true meaning. It is unlikely that he would have shewn what he did to the workmen, had it not been for their unconcealed curiosity. As it was he doubtless wished to avoid any display of peculiar reticence which would increase their discussion of the matter.      That night Charles Ward sat up in his room reading the new-found book and papers, and when day came he did not desist. His meals, on his urgent request when his mother called to see what was amiss, were sent up to him; and in the afternoon he appeared only briefly when the men came to install the Curwen picture and mantelpiece in his study. The next night he slept in snatches in his clothes, meanwhile wrestling feverishly with the unravelling of the cipher manuscript. In the morning his mother saw that he was at work on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher, which he had frequently shewn her before; but in response to her query he said that the Curwen key could not be applied to it. That afternoon he abandoned his work and watched the men fascinatedly as they finished their installation of the picture with its woodwork above a cleverly realistic electric log, setting the mock-fireplace and overmantel a little out from the north wall as if a chimney existed, and boxing in the sides with panelling to match the rooms. The front panel holding the picture was sawn and hinged to allow cupboard space behind it. After the workmen went he moved his work into the study and sat down before it with his eyes half on the cipher and half on the portrait which stared back at him like a year-adding and century-recalling mirror.      His parents, subsequently recalling his conduct at this period, give interesting details anent the policy of concealment which he practiced. Before servants he seldom hid any paper which he might be studying, since he rightly assumed that Curwens intricate and archaic chirography would be too much for them. With his parents, however, he was more circumspect; and unless the manuscript in question were a cipher, or a mere mass of cryptic symbols and unknown ideographs (as that entitled \"To Him Who Shal Come After etc.\" seemed to be), he would cover it with some convenient paper until his caller had departed. At night he kept the papers under lock and key in an antique cabinet of his, where he also placed them whenever he left the room. He soon resumed fairly regular hours and habits, except that his long walks and other outside interests seemed to cease. The opening of school, where he now began his senior year, seemed a great bore to him; and he frequently asserted his determination never to bother with college. He had, he said, important special investigations to make, which would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and the humanities than any university which the world could boast.      Naturally, only one who had always been more or less studious, eccentric, and solitary could have pursued this course for many days without attracting notice. Ward, however, was constitutionally a scholar and a hermit; hence his parents were less surprised than regretful at the close confinement and secrecy he adopted. At the same time, both his father and mother thought it odd that he would shew them no scrap of his treasure-trove, nor give any connected account of such data as he had deciphered. This reticence he explained away as due to a wish to wait until he might announce some connected revelation, but as the weeks passed without further disclosures there began to grow up between the youth and his family a kind of constraint; intensified in his mothers case by her manifest disapproval of all Curwen delvings.      During October Ward began visiting the libraries again, but no longer for the antiquarian matter of his former days. Witchcraft and magic, occultism and daemonology, were what he sought now; and when Providence sources proved unfruitful he would take the train for Boston and tap the wealth of the great library in Copley Square, the Widener Library at Harvard, or the Zion Research Library in Brookline, where certain rare works on Biblical subjects are available. He bought extensively, and fitted up a whole additional set of shelves in his study for newly acquired works on uncanny subjects; while during the Christmas holidays he made a round of out-of-town trips including one to Salem to consult certain records at the Essex Institute.      About the middle of January, 1920, there entered Wards bearing an element of triumph which he did not explain, and he was no more found at work upon the Hutchinson cipher. Instead, he inaugurated a dual policy of chemical research and record-scanning; fitting up for the one a laboratory in the unused attic of the house, and for the latter haunting all the sources of vital statistics in Providence. Local dealers in drugs and scientific supplies, later questioned, gave astonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and instruments he purchased; but clerks at the State House, the City Hall, and the various libraries agree as to the definite object of his second interest. He was searching intensely and feverishly for the grave of Joseph Curwen, from whose slate slab an older generation had so wisely blotted the name.      Little by little there grew upon the Ward family the conviction that something was wrong. Charles had had freaks and changes of minor interests before, but this growing secrecy and absorption in strange pursuits was unlike even him. His school work was the merest pretence; and although he failed in no test, it could be seen that the old application had all vanished. He had other concernments now; and when not in his new laboratory with a score of obsolete alchemical books, could be found either poring over old burial records down town or glued to his volumes of occult lore in his study, where the startlingly - one almost fancied increasingly - similar features of Joseph Curwen stared blandly at him from the great overmantel on the north wall.      Late in March Ward added to his archive-searching a ghoulish series of rambles about the various ancient cemeteries of the city. The cause appeared later, when it was learned from City Hall clerks that he had probably found an important clue. His quest had suddenly shifted from the grave of Joseph Curwen to that of one Naphthali Field; and this shift was explained when, upon going over the files that he had been over, the investigators actually found a fragmentary record of Curwens burial which had escaped the general obliteration, and which stated that the curious leaden coffin had been interred \"10 ft. S. and 5 ft. W. of Naphthali Fields grave in ye - \". The lack of a specified burying-ground in the surviving entry greatly complicated the search, and Naphthali Fields grave seemed as elusive as that of Curwen; but here no systematic effacement had existed, and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on the stone itself even if its record had perished. Hence the rambles - from which St. Johns (the former Kings) Churchyard and the ancient Congregational burying-ground in the midst of Swan Point Cemetery were excluded, since other statistics had shewn that the only Naphthali Field (obiit 1729) whose grave could have been meant had been a Baptist.4.      It was toward May when Dr. Willett, at the request of the senior Ward, and fortified with all the Curwen data which the family had gleaned from Charles in his non-secretive days, talked with the young man. The interview was of little value or conclusiveness, for Willett felt at every moment that Charles was thoroughly master of himself and in touch with matters of real importance; but it at least forced the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanour. Of a pallid, impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment, Ward seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits, though not to reveal their object. He stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early scientific knowledge, for the most part in cipher, of an apparent scope comparable only to the discoveries of Friar Bacon and perhaps surpassing even those. They were, however, meaningless except when correlated with a body of learning now wholly obsolete; so that their immediate presentation to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all impressiveness and dramatic significance. To take their vivid place in the history of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of which they evolved, and to this task of correlation Ward was now devoting himself. He was seeking to acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of the Curwen data must possess, and hoped in time to make a full announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to the world of thought. Not even Einstein, he declared, could more profoundly revolutionise the current conception of things.      As to his graveyard search, whose object he freely admitted, but the details of whose progress he did not relate, he said he had reason to think that Joseph Curwens mutilated headstone bore certain mystic symbols - carved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by those who had effaced the name - which were absolutely essential to the final solution of his cryptic system. Curwen, he believed, had wished to guard his secret with care; and had consequently distributed the data in an exceedingly curious fashion. When Dr. Willett asked to see the mystic documents, Ward displayed much reluctance and tried to put him off with such things as photostatic copies of the Hutchinson cipher and Orne formulae and diagrams; but finally shewed him the exteriors of some of the real Curwen finds - the \"Journall and Notes\", the cipher (title in cipher also), and the formula-filled message \"To Him Who Shal Come After\" - and let him glance inside such as were in obscure characters.      He also opened the diary at a page carefully selected for its innocuousness and gave Willett a glimpse of Curwens connected handwriting in English. The doctor noted very closely the crabbed and complicated letters, and the general aura of the seventeenth century which clung round both penmanship and style despite the writers survival into the eighteenth century, and became quickly certain that the document was genuine. The text itself was relatively trivial, and Willett recalled only a fragment:\"Wedn. 16 Octr. 1754.

Simon hath not Writ these V. Weekes, but I expecte soon hearg from him.\"      When upon reaching this point Dr. Willett turned the leaf he was quickly checked by Ward, who almost snatched the book from his grasp. All that the doctor had a chance to see on the newly opened page was a brief pair of sentences; but these, strangely enough, lingered tenaciously in his memory. They ran: \"Ye Verse from Liber-Damnatus beg spoke V Roodmasses and IV Hallows-Eves, I am Hopeful ye Thing is breedg Outside ye Spheres. It will drawe One who is to Come, if I can make sure he shal bee, and he shall think on Past thinges and look back thro all ye yeares, against ye which I must have ready ye Saltes or That to make em with.\"      Willett saw no more, but somehow this small glimpse gave a new and vague terror to the painted features of Joseph Curwen which stared blandly down from the overmantel. Ever after that he entertained the odd fancy - which his medical skill of course assured him was only a fancy - that the eyes of the portrait had a sort of wish, if not an actual tendency, to follow young Charles Ward as he moved about the room. He stopped before leaving to study the picture closely, marvelling at its resemblance to Charles and memorising every minute detail of the cryptical, colourless face, even down to a slight scar or pit in the smooth brow above the right eye. Cosmo Alexander, he decided, was a painter worthy of the Scotland that produced Raeburn, and a teacher worthy of his illustrious pupil Gilbert Stuart.      Assured by the doctor that Charless mental health was in no danger, but that on the other hand he was engaged in researches which might prove of real importance, the Wards were more lenient than they might otherwise have been when during the following June the youth made positive his refusal to attend college. He had, he declared, studies of much more vital importance to pursue; and intimated a wish to go abroad the following year in order to avail himself of certain sources of data not existing in America. The senior Ward, while denying this latter wish as absurd for a boy of only eighteen, acquiesced regarding the university; so that after a none too brilliant graduation from the Moses Brown School there ensued for Charles a three-year period of intensive occult study and graveyard searching. He became recognised as an eccentric, and dropped even more completely from the sight of his familys friends than he had been before; keeping close to his work and only occasionally making trips to other cities to consult obscure records. Once he went south to talk with a strange old mulatto who dwelt in a swamp and about whom a newspaper had printed a curious article. Again he sought a small village in the Adirondacks whence reports of certain odd ceremonial practices had come. But still his parents forbade him the trip to the Old World which he desired.      Coming of age in April, 1923, and having previously inherited a small competence from his maternal grandfather, Ward determined at last to take the European trip hitherto denied him. Of his proposed itinerary he would say nothing save that the needs of his studies would carry him to many places, but he promised to write his parents fully and faithfully. When they saw he could not be dissuaded, they ceased all opposition and helped as best they could; so that in June the young man sailed for Liverpool with the farewell blessings of his father and mother, who accompanied him to Boston and waved him out of sight from the White Star pier in Charlestown. Letters soon told of his safe arrival, and of his securing good quarters in Great Russell Street, London; where he proposed to stay, shunning all family friends, till he had exhausted the resources of the British Museum in a certain direction. Of his daily life he wrote but little, for there was little to write. Study and experiment consumed all his time, and he mentioned a laboratory which he had established in one of his rooms. That he said nothing of antiquarian rambles in the glamorous old city with its luring skyline of ancient domes and steeples and its tangles of roads and alleys whose mystic convolutions and sudden vistas alternately beckon and surprise, was taken by his parents as a good index of the degree to which his new interests had engrossed his mind.      In June, 1924, a brief note told of his departure for Paris, to which he had before made one or two flying trips for material in the Bibliothque Nationale. For three months thereafter he sent only postal cards, giving an address in the Rue St. Jacques and referring to a special search among rare manuscripts in the library of an unnamed private collector. He avoided acquaintances, and no tourists brought back reports of having seen him. Then came a silence, and in October the Wards received a picture card from Prague, Czecho-Slovakia, stating that Charles was in that ancient town for the purpose of conferring with a certain very aged man supposed to be the last living possessor of some very curious mediaeval information. He gave an address in the Neustadt, and announced no move till the following January; when he dropped several cards from Vienna telling of his passage through that city on the way toward a more easterly region whither one of his correspondents and fellow-delvers into the occult had invited him.      The next card was from Klausenburg in Transylvania, and told of Wards progress toward his destination. He was going to visit a Baron Ferenczy, whose estate lay in the mountains east of Rakus; and was to be addressed at Rakus in the care of that nobleman. Another card from Rakus a week later, saying that his hosts carriage had met him and that he was leaving the village for the mountains, was his last message for a considerable time; indeed, he did not reply to his parents frequent letters until May, when he wrote to discourage the plan of his mother for a meeting in London, Paris, or Rome during the summer, when the elder Wards were planning to travel in Europe. His researches, he said, were such that he could not leave his present quarters; while the situation of Baron Ferenczys castle did not favour visits. It was on a crag in the dark wooded mountains, and the region was so shunned by the country folk that normal people could not help feeling ill at ease. Moreover, the Baron was not a person likely to appeal to correct and conservative New England gentlefolk. His aspect and manners had idiosyncrasies, and his age was so great as to be disquieting. It would be better, Charles said, if his parents would wait for his return to Providence; which could scarcely be far distant.      That return did not, however, take place until May, 1926, when after a few heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into New York on the Homeric and traversed the long miles to Providence by motor-coach, eagerly drinking in the green rolling hills, the fragrant, blossoming orchards, and the white steepled towns of vernal Connecticut; his first taste of ancient New England in nearly four years. When the coach crossed the Pawcatuck and entered Rhode Island amidst the faery goldenness of a late spring afternoon his heart beat with quickened force, and the entry to Providence along Reservoir and Elmwood avenues was a breathless and wonderful thing despite the depths of forbidden lore to which he had delved. At the high square where Broad, Weybosset, and Empire Streets join, he saw before and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant, remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town; and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down the terminal behind the Biltmore, bringing into view the great dome and soft, roof-pierced greenery of the ancient hill across the river, and the tall colonial spire of the First Baptist Church limned pink in the magic evening light against the fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous background.      Old Providence! It was this place and the mysterious forces of its long, continuous history which had brought him into being, and which had drawn him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no prophet might fix. Here lay the arcana, wondrous or dreadful as the case might be, for which all his years of travel and application had been preparing him. A taxicab whirled him through Post Office Square with its glimpse of the river, the old Market House, and the head of the bay, and up the steep curved slope of Waterman Street to Prospect, where the vast gleaming dome and sunset-flushed Ionic columns of the Christian Science Church beckoned northward. Then eight squares past the fine old estates his childish eyes had known, and the quaint brick sidewalks so often trodden by his youthful feet. And at last the little white overtaken farmhouse on the right, on the left the classic Adam porch and stately bayed facade of the great brick house where he was born. It was twilight, and Charles Dexter Ward had come home.5.      A school of alienists slightly less academic than Dr. Lymans assign to Wards European trip the beginning of his true madness. Admitting that he was sane when he started, they believe that his conduct upon returning implies a disastrous change. But even to this claim Dr. Willett refuses to accede. There was, he insists, something later; and the queernesses of the youth at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroad - odd enough things, to be sure, but by no means implying mental aberration on the part of their celebrant. Ward himself, though visibly aged and hardened, was still normal in his general reactions; and in several talks with Willett displayed a balance which no madman - even an incipient one - could feign continuously for long. What elicited the notion of insanity at this period were the sounds heard at all hours from Wards attic laboratory, in which he kept himself most of the time. There were chantings and repetitions, and thunderous declamations in uncanny rhythms; and although these sounds were always in Wards own voice, there was something in the quality of that voice, and in the accents of the formulae it pronounced, which could not but chill the blood of every hearer. It was noticed that Nig, the venerable and beloved black cat of the household, bristled and arched his back perceptibly when certain of the tones were heard.      The odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise exceedingly strange. Sometimes they were very noxious, but more often they were aromatic, with a haunting, elusive quality which seemed to have the power of inducing fantastic images. People who smelled them had a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas, with strange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite distance. Ward did not resume his old-time rambles, but applied himself diligently to the strange books he had brought home, and to equally strange delvings within his quarters; explaining that European sources had greatly enlarged the possibilities of his work, and promising great revelations in the years to come. His older aspect increased to a startling degree his resemblance to the Curwen portrait in his library; and Dr. Willett would often pause by the latter after a call, marvelling at the virtual identity, and reflecting that only the small pit above the pictures right eye now remained to differentiate the long-dead wizard from the living youth. These calls of Willetts, undertaken at the request of the senior Wards, were curious affairs. Ward at no time repulsed the doctor, but the latter saw that he could never reach the young mans inner psychology. Frequently he noted peculiar things about; little wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables, and the half-erased remnants of circles, triangles, and pentagrams in chalk or charcoal on the cleared central space of the large room. And always in the night those rhythms and incantations thundered, till it became very difficult to keep servants or suppress furtive talk of Charless madness.      In January, 1927, a peculiar incident occurred. One night about midnight, as Charles was chanting a ritual whose weird cadence echoed unpleasantly through the house below, there came a sudden gust of chill wind from the bay, and a faint, obscure trembling of the earth which everyone in the neighbourhood noted. At the same time the cat exhibited phenomenal traces of fright, while dogs bayed for as much as a mile around. This was the prelude to a sharp thunderstorm, anomalous for the season, which brought with it such a crash that Mr. and Mrs. Ward believed the house had been struck. They rushed upstairs to see what damage had been done, but Charles met them at the door to the attic; pale, resolute, and portentous, with an almost fearsome combination of triumph and seriousness on his face. He assured them that the house had not really been struck, and that the storm would soon be over. They paused, and looking through a window saw that he was indeed right; for the lightning flashed farther and farther off, whilst the trees ceased to bend in the strange frigid gust from the water. The thunder sank to a sort of dull mumbling chuckle and finally died away. Stars came out, and the stamp of triumph on Charles Wards face crystallised into a very singular expression.      For two months or more after this incident Ward was less confined than usual to his laboratory. He exhibited a curious interest in the weather, and made odd inquiries about the date of the spring thawing of the ground. One night late in March he left the house after midnight, and did not return till almost morning; when his mother, being wakeful, heard a rumbling motor draw up to the carriage entrance. Muffled oaths could be distinguished, and Mrs. Ward, rising and going to the window, saw four dark figures removing a long, heavy box from a truck at Charless direction and carrying it within by the side door. She heard laboured breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs, and finally a dull thumping in the attic; after which the footfalls descended again, and the four men reappeared outside and drove off in their truck.      The next day Charles resumed his strict attic seclusion, drawing down the dark shades of his laboratory windows and appearing to be working on some metal substance. He would open the door to no one, and steadfastly refused all proffered food. About noon a wrenching sound followed by a terrible cry and a fall were heard, but when Mrs. Ward rapped at the door her son at length answered faintly, and told her that nothing had gone amiss. The hideous and indescribable stench now welling out was absolutely harmless and unfortunately necessary. Solitude was the one prime essential, and he would appear later for dinner. That afternoon, after the conclusion of some odd hissing sounds which came from behind the locked portal, he did finally appear; wearing an extremely haggard aspect and forbidding anyone to enter the laboratory upon any pretext. This, indeed, proved the beginning of a new policy of secrecy; for never afterward was any other person permitted to visit either the mysterious garret workroom or the adjacent storeroom which he cleaned out, furnished roughly, and added to his inviolably private domain as a sleeping apartment. Here he lived, with books brought up from his library beneath, till the time he purchased the Pawtuxet bungalow and moved to it all his scientific effects.      In the evening Charles secured the paper before the rest of the family and damaged part of it through an apparent accident. Later on Dr. Willett, having fixed the date from statements by various members of the household, looked up an intact copy at the Journal office and found that in the destroyed section the following small item had occurred:Nocturnal Diggers Surprised inNorth Burial GroundRobert Hart, night watchman at the North Burial Ground, this morning discovered a party of several men with a motor truck in the oldest part of the cemetery, but apparently frightened them off before they had accomplished whatever their object may have been.      The discovery took place at about four oclock, when Harts attention was attracted by the sound of a motor outside his shelter. Investigating, he saw a large truck on the main drive several rods away; but could not reach it before the sound of his feet on the gravel had revealed his approach. The men hastily placed a large box in the truck and drove away toward the street before they could be overtaken; and since no known grave was disturbed, Hart believes that this box was an object which they wished to bury.      The diggers must have been at work for a long while before detection, for Hart found an enormous hole dug at a considerable distance back from the roadway in the lot of Amasa Field, where most of the old stones have long ago disappeared. The hole, a place as large and deep as a grave, was empty; and did not coincide with any interment mentioned in the cemetery records.      Sergt. Riley of the Second Station viewed the spot and gave the opinion that the hole was dug by bootleggers rather gruesomely and ingeniously seeking a safe cache for liquor in a place not likely to be disturbed. In reply to questions Hart said he thought the escaping truck had headed up Rochambeau Avenue, though he could not be sure.      During the next few days Ward was seldom seen by his family. Having added sleeping quarters to his attic realm, he kept closely to himself there, ordering food brought to the door and not taking it in until after the servant had gone away. The droning of monotonous formulae and the chanting of bizarre rhythms recurred at intervals, while at other times occasional listeners could detect the sound of tinkling glass, hissing chemicals, running water, or roaring gas flames. Odours of the most unplaceable quality, wholly unlike any before noted, hung at times around the door; and the air of tension observable in the young recluse whenever he did venture briefly forth was such as to excite the keenest speculation. Once he made a hasty trip to the Athenaeum for a book he required, and again he hired a messenger to fetch him a highly obscure volume from Boston. Suspense was written portentously over the whole situation, and both the family and Dr. Willett confessed themselves wholly at a loss what to do or think about it.6.      Then on the fifteenth of April a strange development occurred. While nothing appeared to grow different in kind, there was certainly a very terrible difference in degree; and Dr. Willett somehow attaches great significance to the change. The day was Good Friday, a circumstance of which the servants made much, but which others quite naturally dismiss as an irrelevant coincidence. Late in the afternoon young Ward began repeating a certain formula in a singularly loud voice, at the same time burning some substance so pungent that its fumes escaped over the entire house. The formula was so plainly audible in the hall outside the locked door that Mrs. Ward could not help memorising it as she waited and listened anxiously, and later on she was able to write it down at Dr. Willetts request. It ran as follows, and experts have told Dr. Willett that its very close analogue can be found in the mystic writings of \"Eliphas Levi\", that cryptic soul who crept through a crack in the forbidden door and glimpsed the frightful vistas of the void beyond:\"Per Adonai Eloim, Adonai Jehova,Adonai Sabaoth, Metraton On Agla Mathon,verbum pythonicum, mysterium salamandrae,conventus sylvorum, antra gnomorum,daemonia Coeli Gad, Almousin, Gibor, Jehosua,Evam, Zariatnatmik, veni, veni, veni.\"      This had been going on for two hours without change or intermission when over all the neighbourhood a pandaemoniac howling of dogs set in. The extent of this howling can be judged from the space it received in the papers the next day, but to those in the Ward household it was overshadowed by the odour which instantly followed it; a hideous, all-pervasive odour which none of them had ever smelt before or have ever smelt since. In the midst of this mephitic flood there came a very perceptible flash like that of lightning, which would have been blinding and impressive but for the daylight around; and then was heard the voice that no listener can ever forget because of its thunderous remoteness, its incredible depth, and its eldritch dissimilarity to Charles Wards voice. It shook the house, and was clearly heard by at least two neighbours above the howling of the dogs. Mrs. Ward, who had been listening in despair outside her sons locked laboratory, shivered as she recognised its hellish import; for Charles had told her of its evil fame in dark books, and of the manner in which it had thundered, according to the Fenner letters, above the doomed Pawtuxet farmhouse on the night of Joseph Curwens annihilation. There was no mistaking that nightmare phrase, for Charles had described it too vividly in the old days when he had talked frankly of his Curwen investigations. And yet it was only this fragment of an archaic and forgotten language: \"DIES MIES JESCHET BOENE DOESEF DOUVEMA ENITEMAUS\".      Close upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening of the daylight, though sunset was still an hour distant, and then a puff of added odour different from the first but equally unknown and intolerable. Charles was chanting again now and his mother could hear syllables that sounded like \"Yi-nash-Yog-Sothoth-he-lgeb-fi-throdog\" - ending in a \"Yah!\" whose maniacal force mounted in an ear-splitting crescendo. A second later all previous memories were effaced by the wailing scream which burst out with frantic explosiveness and gradually changed form to a paroxysm of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Mrs. Ward, with the mingled fear and blind courage of maternity, advanced and knocked affrightedly at the concealing panels, but obtained no sign of recognition. She knocked again, but paused nervelessly as a second shriek arose, this one unmistakably in the familiar voice of her son, and sounding concurrently with the still bursting cachinnations of that other voice. Presently she fainted, although she is still unable to recall the precise and immediate cause. Memory sometimes makes merciful deletions.      Mr. Ward returned from the business section at about quarter past six; and not finding his wife downstairs, was told by the frightened servants that she was probably watching at Charless door, from which the sounds had been far stranger than ever before. Mounting the stairs at once, he saw Mrs. Ward stretched at full length on the floor of the corridor outside the laboratory; and realising that she had fainted, hastened to fetch a glass of water from a set bowl in a neighbouring alcove. Dashing the cold fluid in her face, he was heartened to observe an immediate response on her part, and was watching the bewildered opening of her eyes when a chill shot through him and threatened to reduce him to the very state from which she was emerging. For the seemingly silent laboratory was not as silent as it had appeared to be, but held the murmurs of a tense, muffled conversation in tones too low for comprehension, yet of a quality profoundly disturbing to the soul.      It was not, of course, new for Charles to mutter formulae; but this muttering was definitely different. It was so palpably a dialogue, or imitation of a dialogue, with the regular alteration of inflections suggesting question and answer, statement and response. One voice was undisguisedly that of Charles, but the other had a depth and hollowness which the youths best powers of ceremonial mimicry had scarcely approached before. There was something hideous, blasphemous, and abnormal about it, and but for a cry from his recovering wife which cleared his mind by arousing his protective instincts it is not likely that Theodore Howland Ward could have maintained for nearly a year more his old boast that he had never fainted. As it was, he seized his wife in his arms and bore her quickly downstairs before she could notice the voices which had so horribly disturbed him. Even so, however, he was not quick enough to escape catching something himself which caused him to stagger dangerously with his burden. For Mrs. Wards cry had evidently been heard by others than he, and there had come from behind the locked door the first distinguishable words which that masked and terrible colloquy had yielded. They were merely an excited caution in Charless own voice, but somehow their implications held a nameless fright for the father who overheard them. The phrase was just this: \"Sshh! - write!\"      Mr. and Mrs. Ward conferred at some length after dinner, and the former resolved to have a firm and serious talk with Charles that very night. No matter how important the object, such conduct could no longer be permitted; for these latest developments transcended every limit of sanity and formed a menace to the order and nervous well-being of the entire household. The youth must indeed have taken complete leave of his senses, since only downright madness could have prompted the wild screams and imaginary conversations in assumed voices which the present day had brought forth. All this must be stopped, or Mrs. Ward would be made ill and the keeping of servants become an impossibility.      Mr. Ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for Charless laboratory. On the third floor, however, he paused at the sounds which he heard proceeding from the now disused library of his son. Books were apparently being flung about and papers wildly rustled, and upon stepping to the door Mr. Ward beheld the youth within, excitedly assembling a vast armful of literary matter of every size and shape. Charless aspect was very drawn and haggard, and he dropped his entire load with a start at the sound of his fathers voice. At the elder mans command he sat down, and for some time listened to the admonitions he had so long deserved. There was no scene. At the end of the lecture he agreed that his father was right, and that his noises, mutterings, incantations, and chemical odours were indeed inexcusable nuisances. He agreed to a policy of greater quiet, though insisting on a prolongation of his extreme privacy. Much of his future work, he said, was in any case purely book research; and he could obtain quarters elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be necessary at a later stage. For the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed the keenest contrition, and explained that the conversation later heard was part of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental atmosphere. His use of abstruse technical terms somewhat bewildered Mr. Ward, but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and poise despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity. The interview was really quite inconclusive, and as Charles picked up his armful and left the room Mr. Ward hardly knew what to make of the entire business. It was as mysterious as the death of poor old Nig, whose stiffening form had been found an hour before in the basement, with staring eyes and fear-distorted mouth.      Driven by some vague detective instinct, the bewildered parent now glanced curiously at the vacant shelves to see what his son had taken up to the attic. The youths library was plainly and rigidly classified, so that one might tell at a glance the books or at least the kind of books which had been withdrawn. On this occasion Mr. Ward was astonished to find that nothing of the occult or the antiquarian, beyond what had been previously removed, was missing. These new withdrawals were all modern items; histories, scientific treatises, geographies, manuals of literature, philosophic works, and certain contemporary newspapers and magazines. It was a very curious shift from Charles Wards recent run of reading, and the father paused in a growing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense of strangeness. The strangeness was a very poignant sensation, and almost clawed at his chest as he strove to see just what was wrong around him. Something was indeed wrong, and tangibly as well as spiritually so. Ever since he had been in this room he had known that something was amiss, and at last it dawned upon him what it was.      On the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the house in Olney Court, but to the cracked and precariously restored oils of the large Curwen portrait disaster had come. Time and unequal heating had done their work at last, and at some time since the rooms last cleaning the worst had happened. Peeling clear of the wood, curling tighter and tighter, and finally crumbling into small bits with what must have been malignly silent suddenness, the portrait of Joseph Curwen had resigned forever its staring surveillance of the youth it so strangely resembled, and now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust.", "Rodrigo: (Laughing) \"Horror? You speak to me of horror? I have seen things which would make the gods tremble!\"Massa di Requiem per ShuggayAct II Scene IVBenevento Chieti Bordighera(Translated from the original Italian)Torren-Wraeth hated being summoned. He hated human sacrifice even more. After all, his mother had been human, but he could not act against his fathers wishes, nor those who had summoned him, at least, not directly. He was here merely to witness, to stand helpless as a life was taken.The youth stood, tall and handsome, his striking Polynesian features offset by his green skin and six slender tendrils that lined his chin and jaw. He was in a house, surrounded by black-robed humans, cult artifacts and blazing braziers. A young man lay upon a stone table, bound, screaming. Torren-Wraeth walked over to the table, regret in his glistening yellow eyes, \"Im so sorry.\" The mans bulging eyes stared past him, followed two of the cultists as they moved toward a spot near the west wall of the basement/temple, strained with terror.The worshipers began to chant, and one among them called out in a loud voice, \"For the glory of Great Cthulhu, we offer this one to The Beast Below!\"\"My father does not need sacrifices...\" Torren-Wraeth said loudly. That was true, to a point. His father did not, in fact, need sacrifices, but he did desire them. Perhaps, he could save this one... But they ignored him. He watched as the men rolled back a large stone, revealing a dark hole beneath. Ghouls? Ghouls can be reasoned with, better than some humans... He frowned, spoke louder \"I said, my father...\"Then it hit him. A noxious smell poured forth through the opening, gagging him. It was not the familiar, moldy corpse smell of ghouls, but something bizarre, like ammonia and drying blood... And there was something else, something far, far worse. Voices. Many voices. Laughing madly, weeping, screaming. Screaming such as Torren-Wraeth had never heard in his life; the horrific, hopeless shrieking of the damned.He unconsciously backed away as a huge form slithered slowly from the deepest region of the pit. Torren-Wraeth nearly vomited at the sight. It was similar in shape to a worm, blood-colored and slimy, but that was not the true horror of the thing, it was its faces... A grinning, evil human face peered from the anterior of the beast, but dozens of other anguished, maddened human faces protruded at random from its hideous form. Their eyes reflected unspeakable torment, madness, and a longing for the release of death. Some babbled or laughed senselessly, others begged for death or wept, or just screamed... So many faces, so much unholy suffering. It turned toward the sacrificial table and its occupant.At the sight the victim screamed in utter terror, but his voice was drowned out by the many voices of the thing. Torren-Wraeth had heard of such things, but had not believed, had hoped that they did not exist.The Chakota.An abomination which absorbed its victims, body and mind, leaving its unfortunate prey trapped within its hateful body, aware but helpless. The first head, the mind of the beast, was the cultist who had willingly created it, literally became the beast, the others the miserable wretches it had absorbed over the years.Torren-Wraeths body turned pale yellow with horror. He had seen so much evil and cruelty in his life, but this, this was vile beyond all reason. The Binding broke with his terror. He was free to act.His reaction was instinctive, human.He screamed, grabbed the nearest brazier, and struck at the beast with it.The Chakota itself screamed as the coals and flames struck its slimy flesh, and it was alight. Torren-Wraeth struck at it again and again, scattering flaming coal across the room, igniting tapestries and furnishings. More braziers were knocked over by the beasts own struggles and the cultists scrambling for the stairs. The stone floor grew hot, and the walls caught fire. The Chakota turned to flee toward its hole, towards cool, dark safety, but Torren-Wraeth drove the broken brazier through it like a stake, pinning it in place. There was no escape.The flames danced across the stones.As the fire raged around him, Torren-Wraeth turned to the sacrificial victim, intending to free him, but a quick glance revealed that the man was dead, his face contorted in terror. He had died of fear.In some ways, he was lucky. He wondered how many of the cultists had died in the fire, and had the brief, dark feeling that they deserved it. He pushed it from his mind.He turned his attention back to the Chakota.The beast writhed in agony. The screams grew louder, shriller, while, from some of the faces trapped within the beast, came shouts of joy and thanksgiving. Facing the flames was preferable to living within the beast...Though it was obscured by smoke and flames, Torren-Wraeth watched as the Chakota quickly shriveled and blackened, withered like a worm on a hot sidewalk.Then, there were only ashes.The fire was spreading too quickly, the heat was intense, he had to leave or risk injury himself. Torren-Wraeth teleported away, leaving the cleansing fire to its work.He returned home. Not RLyeh, but Rapa Nui, which the white men called Easter Island.He threw up, then wept...Later,Torren-Wraeth stood within an ancient quarry, partially carved Moai bearing mute witness to his words. \"No more! No more human sacrifices!\" He shouted at the top of his lungs. He didnt care about the consequences. He had ignored his conscience, his honor for too long.\"You go where you are summoned!\" Great Cthulhus telepathic voice, calling out from his body in RLyeh, registered rage at this defiance.\"Never again!\" Torren-Wraeths voice was firm. He was ashamed that he had ever been party to such a thing, and he refused to do so again. His skin was blotched with conflicting emotion, \"You dont even need sacrifices, much less intelligent ones! I wont help you commit murder, not anymore!\"\"Who are you to judge me!?\"Torren-Wraeth fell silent.Great Cthulhu sighed, his child was becoming sentimental, rebellious. It was his mothers blood, it could not be helped. Ever since he had befriended that human, he had become more like them... Still, it was a small thing. \"Very well, Torren-Wraeth, from now on you will never represent me at a sentient sacrifice again.\"The boy knelt quickly, \"Thank you, father...\"\"Do not thank me yet, I may ask something of you in return.\"And Torren-Wraeth knew without a doubt that he would."]}
{"id": "EN065", "pair": ["III. A Search and an Evocation1.Charles Ward, as we have seen, first learned in 1918 of his descent from Joseph Curwen. That he at once took an intense interest in everything pertaining to the bygone mystery is not to be wondered at; for every vague rumour that he had heard of Curwen now became something vital to himself, in whom flowed Curwens blood. No spirited and imaginative genealogist could have done otherwise than begin forthwith an avid and systematic collection of Curwen data.      In his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at secrecy; so that even Dr. Lyman hesitates to date the youths madness from any period before the close of 1919. He talked freely with his family - though his mother was not particularly pleased to own an ancestor like Curwen - and with the officials of the various museums and libraries he visited. In applying to private families for records thought to be in their possession he made no concealment of his object, and shared the somewhat amused scepticism with which the accounts of the old diarists and letter-writers were regarded. He often expressed a keen wonder as to what really had taken place a century and a half before at that Pawtuxet farmhouse whose site he vainly tried to find, and what Joseph Curwen really had been.      When he came across the Smith diary and archives and encountered the letter from Jedediah Orne he decided to visit Salem and look up Curwens early activities and connexions there, which he did during the Easter vacation of 1919. At the Essex Institute, which was well known to him from former sojourns in the glamorous old town of crumbling Puritan gables and clustered gambrel roofs, he was very kindly received, and unearthed there a considerable amount of Curwen data. He found that his ancestor was born in Salem-Village, now Danvers, seven miles from town, on the eighteenth of February (O.S.) 1662-3; and that he had run away to sea at the age of fifteen, not appearing again for nine years, when he returned with the speech, dress, and manners of a native Englishman and settled in Salem proper. At that time he had little to do with his family, but spent most of his hours with the curious books he had brought from Europe, and the strange chemicals which came for him on ships from England, France, and Holland. Certain trips of his into the country were the objects of much local inquisitiveness, and were whisperingly associated with vague rumours of fires on the hills at night.      Curwens only close friends had been one Edward Hutchinson of Salem-Village and one Simon Orne of Salem. With these men he was often seen in conference about the Common, and visits among them were by no means infrequent. Hutchinson had a house well out toward the woods, and it was not altogether liked by sensitive people because of the sounds heard there at night. He was said to entertain strange visitors, and the lights seen from his windows were not always of the same colour. The knowledge he displayed concerning long-dead persons and long-forgotten events was considered distinctly unwholesome, and he disappeared about the time the witchcraft panic began, never to be heard from again. At that time Joseph Curwen also departed, but his settlement in Providence was soon learned of. Simon Orne lived in Salem until 1720, when his failure to grow visibly old began to excite attention. He thereafter disappeared, though thirty years later his precise counterpart and self-styled son turned up to claim his property. The claim was allowed on the strength of documents in Simon Ornes known hand, and Jedediah Orne continued to dwell in Salem till 1771, when certain letters from Providence citizens to the Rev. Thomas Barnard and others brought about his quiet removal to parts unknown.      Certain documents by and about all of these strange characters were available at the Essex Institute, the Court House, and the Registry of Deeds, and included both harmless commonplaces such as land titles and bills of sale, and furtive fragments of a more provocative nature. There were four or five unmistakable allusions to them on the witchcraft trial records; as when one Hepzibah Lawson swore on July 10, 1692, at the Court of Oyer and Terminer under Judge Hathorne, that fortie Witches and the Blacke Man were wont to meete in the Woodes behind Mr. Hutchinsons house, and one Amity How declared at a session of August 8th before Judge Gedney that Mr. G. B. (Rev. George Burroughs) on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B. Then there was a catalogue of Hutchinsons uncanny library as found after his disappearance, and an unfinished manuscript in his handwriting, couched in a cipher none could read. Ward had a photostatic copy of this manuscript made, and began to work casually on the cipher as soon as it was delivered to him. After the following August his labours on the cipher became intense and feverish, and there is reason to believe from his speech and conduct that he hit upon the key before October or November. He never stated, though, whether or not he had succeeded.      But of the greatest immediate interest was the Orne material. It took Ward only a short time to prove from identity of penmanship a thing he had already considered established from the text of the letter to Curwen; namely, that Simon Orne and his supposed son were one and the same person. As Orne had said to his correspondent, it was hardly safe to live too long in Salem, hence he resorted to a thirty-year sojourn abroad, and did not return to claim his lands except as a representative of a new generation. Orne had apparently been careful to destroy most of his correspondence, but the citizens who took action in 1771 found and preserved a few letters and papers which excited their wonder. There were cryptic formulae and diagrams in his and other hands which Ward now either copied with care or had photographed, and one extremely mysterious letter in a chirography that the searcher recognised from items in the Registry of Deeds as positively Joseph Curwens.      This Curwen letter, though undated as to the year, was evidently not the one in answer to which Orne had written the confiscated missive; and from internal evidence Ward placed it not much later than 1750. It may not be amiss to give the text in full, as a sample of the style of one whose history was so dark and terrible. The recipient is addressed as \"Simon\", but a line (whether drawn by Curwen or Orne Ward could not tell) is run through the word.Prouidence, I.

This letter, oddly enough, was what first gave Ward the exact location of Curwens Providence home; for none of the records encountered up to that time had been at all specific. The discovery was doubly striking because it indicated as the newer Curwen house built in 1761 on the site of the old, a dilapidated building still standing in Olney Court and well known to Ward in his antiquarian rambles over Stampers Hill. The place was indeed only a few squares from his own home on the great hills higher ground, and was now the abode of a negro family much esteemed for occasional washing, housecleaning, and furnace-tending services. To find, in distant Salem, such sudden proof of the significance of this familiar rookery in his own family history, was a highly impressive thing to Ward; and he resolved to explore the place immediately upon his return. The more mystical phases of the letter, which he took to be some extravagant kind of symbolism, frankly baffled him; though he noted with a thrill of curiosity that the Biblical passage referred to - Job 14, 14 - was the familiar verse, \"If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.\"2.      Young Ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement, and spent the following Saturday in a long and exhaustive study of the house in Olney Court. The place, now crumbling with age, had never been a mansion; but was a modest two-and-a-half story wooden town house of the familiar Providence colonial type, with plain peaked roof, large central chimney, and artistically carved doorway with rayed fanlight, triangular pediment, and trim Doric pilasters. It had suffered but little alteration externally, and Ward felt he was gazing on something very close to the sinister matters of his quest.      The present negro inhabitants were known to him, and he was very courteously shewn about the interior by old Asa and his stout wife Hannah. Here there was more change than the outside indicated, and Ward saw with regret that fully half of the fine scroll-and-urn overmantels and shell-carved cupboard linings were gone, whilst much of the fine wainscotting and bolection moulding was marked, hacked, and gouged, or covered up altogether with cheap wall-paper. In general, the survey did not yield as much as Ward had somehow expected; but it was at least exciting to stand within the ancestral walls which had housed such a man of horror as Joseph Curwen. He saw with a thrill that a monogram had been very carefully effaced from the ancient brass knocker.      From then until after the close of school Ward spent his time on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local Curwen data. The former still proved unyielding; but of the latter he obtained so much, and so many clues to similar data elsewhere, that he was ready by July to make a trip to New London and New York to consult old letters whose presence in those places was indicated. This trip was very fruitful, for it brought him the Fenner letters with their terrible description of the Pawtuxet farmhouse raid, and the Nightingale-Talbot letters in which he learned of the portrait painted on a panel of the Curwen library. This matter of the portrait interested him particularly, since he would have given much to know just what Joseph Curwen looked like; and he decided to make a second search of the house in Olney Court to see if there might not be some trace of the ancient features beneath peeling coats of later paint or layers of mouldy wall-paper.      Early in August that search took place, and Ward went carefully over the walls of every room sizeable enough to have been by any possibility the library of the evil builder. He paid especial attention to the large panels of such overmantels as still remained; and was keenly excited after about an hour, when on a broad area above the fireplace in a spacious ground-floor room he became certain that the surface brought out by the peeling of several coats of paint was sensibly darker than any ordinary interior paint or the wood beneath it was likely to have been. A few more careful tests with a thin knife, and he knew that he had come upon an oil portrait of great extent. With truly scholarly restraint the youth did not risk the damage which an immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture with the knife might have done, but just retired from the scene of his discovery to enlist expert help. In three days he returned with an artist of long experience, Mr. Walter C. Dwight, whose studio is near the foot of College Hill; and that accomplished restorer of paintings set to work at once with proper methods and chemical substances. Old Asa and his wife were duly excited over their strange visitors, and were properly reimbursed for this invasion of their domestic hearth.      As day by day the work of restoration progressed, Charles Ward looked on with growing interest at the lines and shades gradually unveiled after their long oblivion. Dwight had begun at the bottom; hence since the picture was a three-quarter-length one, the face did not come out for some time. It was meanwhile seen that the subject was a spare, well-shaped man with dark-blue coat, embroidered waistcoat, black satin small-clothes, and white silk stockings, seated in a carved chair against the background of a window with wharves and ships beyond. When the head came out it was observed to bear a neat Albemarle wig, and to possess a thin, calm, undistinguished face which seemed somehow familiar to both Ward and the artist. Only at the very last, though, did the restorer and his client begin to gasp with astonishment at the details of that lean, pallid visage, and to recognise with a touch of awe the dramatic trick which heredity had played. For it took the final bath of oil and the final stroke of the delicate scraper to bring out fully the expression which centuries had hidden; and to confront the bewildered Charles Dexter Ward, dweller in the past, with his own living features in the countenance of his horrible great-great-great-grandfather.      Ward brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered, and his father at once determined to purchase the picture despite its execution on stationary panelling. The resemblance to the boy, despite an appearance of rather greater age, was marvellous; and it could be seen that through some trick of atavism the physical contours of Joseph Curwen had found precise duplication after a century and a half. Mrs. Wards resemblance to her ancestor was not at all marked, though she could recall relatives who had some of the facial characteristics shared by her son and by the bygone Curwen. She did not relish the discovery, and told her husband that he had better burn the picture instead of bringing it home. There was, she averred, something unwholesome about it; not only intrinsically, but in its very resemblance to Charles. Mr. Ward, however, was a practical man of power and affairs - a cotton manufacturer with extensive mills at Riverpoint in the Pawtuxet Valley - and not one to listen to feminine scruples. The picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to his son, and he believed the boy deserved it as a present. In this opinion, it is needless to say, Charles most heartily concurred; and a few days later Mr. Ward located the owner of the house - a small rodent-featured person with a guttural accent - and obtained the whole mantel and overmantel bearing the picture at a curtly fixed priced which cut short the impending torrent of unctuous haggling.      It now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the Ward home, where provisions were made for its thorough restoration and installation with an electric mock-fireplace in Charless third-floor study or library. To Charles was left the task of superintending this removal, and on the twenty-eighth of August he accompanied two expert workmen from the Crooker decorating firm to the house in Olney Court, where the mantel and portrait-bearing overmantel were detached with great care and precision for transportation in the companys motor truck. There was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the chimneys course, and in this young Ward observed a cubical recess about a foot square, which must have lain directly behind the head of the portrait. Curious as to what such a space might mean or contain, the youth approached and looked within; finding beneath the deep coatings of dust and soot some loose yellowed papers, a crude, thick copybook, and a few mouldering textile shreds which may have formed the ribbon binding the rest together. Blowing away the bulk of the dirt and cinders, he took up the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover. It was in a hand which he had learned to recognise at the Essex Institute, and proclaimed the volume as the \"Journall and Notes of Jos: Curwen, Gent., of Providence-Plantations, Late of Salem.\"      Excited beyond measure by his discovery, Ward shewed the book to the two curious workmen beside him. Their testimony is absolute as to the nature and genuineness of the finding, and Dr. Willett relies on them to help establish his theory that the youth was not mad when he began his major eccentricities. All the other papers were likewise in Curwens handwriting, and one of them seemed especially portentous because of its inscription: \"To Him Who Shal Come After, & How He May Gett Beyonde Time & ye Spheres.\" Another was in a cipher; the same, Ward hoped, as the Hutchinson cipher which had hitherto baffled him. A third, and here the searcher rejoiced, seemed to be a key to the cipher; whilst the fourth and fifth were addressed respectively to \"Edw: Hutchinson, Armiger\" and \"Jedediah Orne, Esq.\", or Their Heir or Heirs, or Those Representg Them. The sixth and last was inscribed: \"Joseph Curwen his Life and Travells Betn ye yeares 1678 and 1687: Of Whither He Voyagd, Where He Stayd, Whom He Sawe, and What He Learnt.\"3.      We have now reached the point from which the more academic school of alienists date Charles Wards madness. Upon his discovery the youth had looked immediately at a few of the inner pages of the book and manuscripts, and had evidently seen something which impressed him tremendously. Indeed, in shewing the titles to the workmen he appeared to guard the text itself with peculiar care, and to labour under a perturbation for which even the antiquarian and genealogical significance of the find could hardly account. Upon returning home he broke the news with an almost embarrassed air, as if he wished to convey an idea of its supreme importance without having to exhibit the evidence itself. He did not even shew the titles to his parents, but simply told them that he had found some documents in Joseph Curwens handwriting, \"mostly in cipher\", which would have to be studied very carefully before yielding up their true meaning. It is unlikely that he would have shewn what he did to the workmen, had it not been for their unconcealed curiosity. As it was he doubtless wished to avoid any display of peculiar reticence which would increase their discussion of the matter.      That night Charles Ward sat up in his room reading the new-found book and papers, and when day came he did not desist. His meals, on his urgent request when his mother called to see what was amiss, were sent up to him; and in the afternoon he appeared only briefly when the men came to install the Curwen picture and mantelpiece in his study. The next night he slept in snatches in his clothes, meanwhile wrestling feverishly with the unravelling of the cipher manuscript. In the morning his mother saw that he was at work on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher, which he had frequently shewn her before; but in response to her query he said that the Curwen key could not be applied to it. That afternoon he abandoned his work and watched the men fascinatedly as they finished their installation of the picture with its woodwork above a cleverly realistic electric log, setting the mock-fireplace and overmantel a little out from the north wall as if a chimney existed, and boxing in the sides with panelling to match the rooms. The front panel holding the picture was sawn and hinged to allow cupboard space behind it. After the workmen went he moved his work into the study and sat down before it with his eyes half on the cipher and half on the portrait which stared back at him like a year-adding and century-recalling mirror.      His parents, subsequently recalling his conduct at this period, give interesting details anent the policy of concealment which he practiced. Before servants he seldom hid any paper which he might be studying, since he rightly assumed that Curwens intricate and archaic chirography would be too much for them. With his parents, however, he was more circumspect; and unless the manuscript in question were a cipher, or a mere mass of cryptic symbols and unknown ideographs (as that entitled \"To Him Who Shal Come After etc.\" seemed to be), he would cover it with some convenient paper until his caller had departed. At night he kept the papers under lock and key in an antique cabinet of his, where he also placed them whenever he left the room. He soon resumed fairly regular hours and habits, except that his long walks and other outside interests seemed to cease. The opening of school, where he now began his senior year, seemed a great bore to him; and he frequently asserted his determination never to bother with college. He had, he said, important special investigations to make, which would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and the humanities than any university which the world could boast.      Naturally, only one who had always been more or less studious, eccentric, and solitary could have pursued this course for many days without attracting notice. Ward, however, was constitutionally a scholar and a hermit; hence his parents were less surprised than regretful at the close confinement and secrecy he adopted. At the same time, both his father and mother thought it odd that he would shew them no scrap of his treasure-trove, nor give any connected account of such data as he had deciphered. This reticence he explained away as due to a wish to wait until he might announce some connected revelation, but as the weeks passed without further disclosures there began to grow up between the youth and his family a kind of constraint; intensified in his mothers case by her manifest disapproval of all Curwen delvings.      During October Ward began visiting the libraries again, but no longer for the antiquarian matter of his former days. Witchcraft and magic, occultism and daemonology, were what he sought now; and when Providence sources proved unfruitful he would take the train for Boston and tap the wealth of the great library in Copley Square, the Widener Library at Harvard, or the Zion Research Library in Brookline, where certain rare works on Biblical subjects are available. He bought extensively, and fitted up a whole additional set of shelves in his study for newly acquired works on uncanny subjects; while during the Christmas holidays he made a round of out-of-town trips including one to Salem to consult certain records at the Essex Institute.      About the middle of January, 1920, there entered Wards bearing an element of triumph which he did not explain, and he was no more found at work upon the Hutchinson cipher. Instead, he inaugurated a dual policy of chemical research and record-scanning; fitting up for the one a laboratory in the unused attic of the house, and for the latter haunting all the sources of vital statistics in Providence. Local dealers in drugs and scientific supplies, later questioned, gave astonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and instruments he purchased; but clerks at the State House, the City Hall, and the various libraries agree as to the definite object of his second interest. He was searching intensely and feverishly for the grave of Joseph Curwen, from whose slate slab an older generation had so wisely blotted the name.      Little by little there grew upon the Ward family the conviction that something was wrong. Charles had had freaks and changes of minor interests before, but this growing secrecy and absorption in strange pursuits was unlike even him. His school work was the merest pretence; and although he failed in no test, it could be seen that the old application had all vanished. He had other concernments now; and when not in his new laboratory with a score of obsolete alchemical books, could be found either poring over old burial records down town or glued to his volumes of occult lore in his study, where the startlingly - one almost fancied increasingly - similar features of Joseph Curwen stared blandly at him from the great overmantel on the north wall.      Late in March Ward added to his archive-searching a ghoulish series of rambles about the various ancient cemeteries of the city. The cause appeared later, when it was learned from City Hall clerks that he had probably found an important clue. His quest had suddenly shifted from the grave of Joseph Curwen to that of one Naphthali Field; and this shift was explained when, upon going over the files that he had been over, the investigators actually found a fragmentary record of Curwens burial which had escaped the general obliteration, and which stated that the curious leaden coffin had been interred \"10 ft. S. and 5 ft. W. of Naphthali Fields grave in ye - \". The lack of a specified burying-ground in the surviving entry greatly complicated the search, and Naphthali Fields grave seemed as elusive as that of Curwen; but here no systematic effacement had existed, and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on the stone itself even if its record had perished. Hence the rambles - from which St. Johns (the former Kings) Churchyard and the ancient Congregational burying-ground in the midst of Swan Point Cemetery were excluded, since other statistics had shewn that the only Naphthali Field (obiit 1729) whose grave could have been meant had been a Baptist.4.      It was toward May when Dr. Willett, at the request of the senior Ward, and fortified with all the Curwen data which the family had gleaned from Charles in his non-secretive days, talked with the young man. The interview was of little value or conclusiveness, for Willett felt at every moment that Charles was thoroughly master of himself and in touch with matters of real importance; but it at least forced the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanour. Of a pallid, impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment, Ward seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits, though not to reveal their object. He stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early scientific knowledge, for the most part in cipher, of an apparent scope comparable only to the discoveries of Friar Bacon and perhaps surpassing even those. They were, however, meaningless except when correlated with a body of learning now wholly obsolete; so that their immediate presentation to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all impressiveness and dramatic significance. To take their vivid place in the history of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of which they evolved, and to this task of correlation Ward was now devoting himself. He was seeking to acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of the Curwen data must possess, and hoped in time to make a full announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to the world of thought. Not even Einstein, he declared, could more profoundly revolutionise the current conception of things.      As to his graveyard search, whose object he freely admitted, but the details of whose progress he did not relate, he said he had reason to think that Joseph Curwens mutilated headstone bore certain mystic symbols - carved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by those who had effaced the name - which were absolutely essential to the final solution of his cryptic system. Curwen, he believed, had wished to guard his secret with care; and had consequently distributed the data in an exceedingly curious fashion. When Dr. Willett asked to see the mystic documents, Ward displayed much reluctance and tried to put him off with such things as photostatic copies of the Hutchinson cipher and Orne formulae and diagrams; but finally shewed him the exteriors of some of the real Curwen finds - the \"Journall and Notes\", the cipher (title in cipher also), and the formula-filled message \"To Him Who Shal Come After\" - and let him glance inside such as were in obscure characters.      He also opened the diary at a page carefully selected for its innocuousness and gave Willett a glimpse of Curwens connected handwriting in English. The doctor noted very closely the crabbed and complicated letters, and the general aura of the seventeenth century which clung round both penmanship and style despite the writers survival into the eighteenth century, and became quickly certain that the document was genuine. The text itself was relatively trivial, and Willett recalled only a fragment:\"Wedn. 16 Octr. 1754.

Simon hath not Writ these V. Weekes, but I expecte soon hearg from him.\"      When upon reaching this point Dr. Willett turned the leaf he was quickly checked by Ward, who almost snatched the book from his grasp. All that the doctor had a chance to see on the newly opened page was a brief pair of sentences; but these, strangely enough, lingered tenaciously in his memory. They ran: \"Ye Verse from Liber-Damnatus beg spoke V Roodmasses and IV Hallows-Eves, I am Hopeful ye Thing is breedg Outside ye Spheres. It will drawe One who is to Come, if I can make sure he shal bee, and he shall think on Past thinges and look back thro all ye yeares, against ye which I must have ready ye Saltes or That to make em with.\"      Willett saw no more, but somehow this small glimpse gave a new and vague terror to the painted features of Joseph Curwen which stared blandly down from the overmantel. Ever after that he entertained the odd fancy - which his medical skill of course assured him was only a fancy - that the eyes of the portrait had a sort of wish, if not an actual tendency, to follow young Charles Ward as he moved about the room. He stopped before leaving to study the picture closely, marvelling at its resemblance to Charles and memorising every minute detail of the cryptical, colourless face, even down to a slight scar or pit in the smooth brow above the right eye. Cosmo Alexander, he decided, was a painter worthy of the Scotland that produced Raeburn, and a teacher worthy of his illustrious pupil Gilbert Stuart.      Assured by the doctor that Charless mental health was in no danger, but that on the other hand he was engaged in researches which might prove of real importance, the Wards were more lenient than they might otherwise have been when during the following June the youth made positive his refusal to attend college. He had, he declared, studies of much more vital importance to pursue; and intimated a wish to go abroad the following year in order to avail himself of certain sources of data not existing in America. The senior Ward, while denying this latter wish as absurd for a boy of only eighteen, acquiesced regarding the university; so that after a none too brilliant graduation from the Moses Brown School there ensued for Charles a three-year period of intensive occult study and graveyard searching. He became recognised as an eccentric, and dropped even more completely from the sight of his familys friends than he had been before; keeping close to his work and only occasionally making trips to other cities to consult obscure records. Once he went south to talk with a strange old mulatto who dwelt in a swamp and about whom a newspaper had printed a curious article. Again he sought a small village in the Adirondacks whence reports of certain odd ceremonial practices had come. But still his parents forbade him the trip to the Old World which he desired.      Coming of age in April, 1923, and having previously inherited a small competence from his maternal grandfather, Ward determined at last to take the European trip hitherto denied him. Of his proposed itinerary he would say nothing save that the needs of his studies would carry him to many places, but he promised to write his parents fully and faithfully. When they saw he could not be dissuaded, they ceased all opposition and helped as best they could; so that in June the young man sailed for Liverpool with the farewell blessings of his father and mother, who accompanied him to Boston and waved him out of sight from the White Star pier in Charlestown. Letters soon told of his safe arrival, and of his securing good quarters in Great Russell Street, London; where he proposed to stay, shunning all family friends, till he had exhausted the resources of the British Museum in a certain direction. Of his daily life he wrote but little, for there was little to write. Study and experiment consumed all his time, and he mentioned a laboratory which he had established in one of his rooms. That he said nothing of antiquarian rambles in the glamorous old city with its luring skyline of ancient domes and steeples and its tangles of roads and alleys whose mystic convolutions and sudden vistas alternately beckon and surprise, was taken by his parents as a good index of the degree to which his new interests had engrossed his mind.      In June, 1924, a brief note told of his departure for Paris, to which he had before made one or two flying trips for material in the Bibliothque Nationale. For three months thereafter he sent only postal cards, giving an address in the Rue St. Jacques and referring to a special search among rare manuscripts in the library of an unnamed private collector. He avoided acquaintances, and no tourists brought back reports of having seen him. Then came a silence, and in October the Wards received a picture card from Prague, Czecho-Slovakia, stating that Charles was in that ancient town for the purpose of conferring with a certain very aged man supposed to be the last living possessor of some very curious mediaeval information. He gave an address in the Neustadt, and announced no move till the following January; when he dropped several cards from Vienna telling of his passage through that city on the way toward a more easterly region whither one of his correspondents and fellow-delvers into the occult had invited him.      The next card was from Klausenburg in Transylvania, and told of Wards progress toward his destination. He was going to visit a Baron Ferenczy, whose estate lay in the mountains east of Rakus; and was to be addressed at Rakus in the care of that nobleman. Another card from Rakus a week later, saying that his hosts carriage had met him and that he was leaving the village for the mountains, was his last message for a considerable time; indeed, he did not reply to his parents frequent letters until May, when he wrote to discourage the plan of his mother for a meeting in London, Paris, or Rome during the summer, when the elder Wards were planning to travel in Europe. His researches, he said, were such that he could not leave his present quarters; while the situation of Baron Ferenczys castle did not favour visits. It was on a crag in the dark wooded mountains, and the region was so shunned by the country folk that normal people could not help feeling ill at ease. Moreover, the Baron was not a person likely to appeal to correct and conservative New England gentlefolk. His aspect and manners had idiosyncrasies, and his age was so great as to be disquieting. It would be better, Charles said, if his parents would wait for his return to Providence; which could scarcely be far distant.      That return did not, however, take place until May, 1926, when after a few heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into New York on the Homeric and traversed the long miles to Providence by motor-coach, eagerly drinking in the green rolling hills, the fragrant, blossoming orchards, and the white steepled towns of vernal Connecticut; his first taste of ancient New England in nearly four years. When the coach crossed the Pawcatuck and entered Rhode Island amidst the faery goldenness of a late spring afternoon his heart beat with quickened force, and the entry to Providence along Reservoir and Elmwood avenues was a breathless and wonderful thing despite the depths of forbidden lore to which he had delved. At the high square where Broad, Weybosset, and Empire Streets join, he saw before and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant, remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town; and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down the terminal behind the Biltmore, bringing into view the great dome and soft, roof-pierced greenery of the ancient hill across the river, and the tall colonial spire of the First Baptist Church limned pink in the magic evening light against the fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous background.      Old Providence! It was this place and the mysterious forces of its long, continuous history which had brought him into being, and which had drawn him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no prophet might fix. Here lay the arcana, wondrous or dreadful as the case might be, for which all his years of travel and application had been preparing him. A taxicab whirled him through Post Office Square with its glimpse of the river, the old Market House, and the head of the bay, and up the steep curved slope of Waterman Street to Prospect, where the vast gleaming dome and sunset-flushed Ionic columns of the Christian Science Church beckoned northward. Then eight squares past the fine old estates his childish eyes had known, and the quaint brick sidewalks so often trodden by his youthful feet. And at last the little white overtaken farmhouse on the right, on the left the classic Adam porch and stately bayed facade of the great brick house where he was born. It was twilight, and Charles Dexter Ward had come home.5.      A school of alienists slightly less academic than Dr. Lymans assign to Wards European trip the beginning of his true madness. Admitting that he was sane when he started, they believe that his conduct upon returning implies a disastrous change. But even to this claim Dr. Willett refuses to accede. There was, he insists, something later; and the queernesses of the youth at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroad - odd enough things, to be sure, but by no means implying mental aberration on the part of their celebrant. Ward himself, though visibly aged and hardened, was still normal in his general reactions; and in several talks with Willett displayed a balance which no madman - even an incipient one - could feign continuously for long. What elicited the notion of insanity at this period were the sounds heard at all hours from Wards attic laboratory, in which he kept himself most of the time. There were chantings and repetitions, and thunderous declamations in uncanny rhythms; and although these sounds were always in Wards own voice, there was something in the quality of that voice, and in the accents of the formulae it pronounced, which could not but chill the blood of every hearer. It was noticed that Nig, the venerable and beloved black cat of the household, bristled and arched his back perceptibly when certain of the tones were heard.      The odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise exceedingly strange. Sometimes they were very noxious, but more often they were aromatic, with a haunting, elusive quality which seemed to have the power of inducing fantastic images. People who smelled them had a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas, with strange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite distance. Ward did not resume his old-time rambles, but applied himself diligently to the strange books he had brought home, and to equally strange delvings within his quarters; explaining that European sources had greatly enlarged the possibilities of his work, and promising great revelations in the years to come. His older aspect increased to a startling degree his resemblance to the Curwen portrait in his library; and Dr. Willett would often pause by the latter after a call, marvelling at the virtual identity, and reflecting that only the small pit above the pictures right eye now remained to differentiate the long-dead wizard from the living youth. These calls of Willetts, undertaken at the request of the senior Wards, were curious affairs. Ward at no time repulsed the doctor, but the latter saw that he could never reach the young mans inner psychology. Frequently he noted peculiar things about; little wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables, and the half-erased remnants of circles, triangles, and pentagrams in chalk or charcoal on the cleared central space of the large room. And always in the night those rhythms and incantations thundered, till it became very difficult to keep servants or suppress furtive talk of Charless madness.      In January, 1927, a peculiar incident occurred. One night about midnight, as Charles was chanting a ritual whose weird cadence echoed unpleasantly through the house below, there came a sudden gust of chill wind from the bay, and a faint, obscure trembling of the earth which everyone in the neighbourhood noted. At the same time the cat exhibited phenomenal traces of fright, while dogs bayed for as much as a mile around. This was the prelude to a sharp thunderstorm, anomalous for the season, which brought with it such a crash that Mr. and Mrs. Ward believed the house had been struck. They rushed upstairs to see what damage had been done, but Charles met them at the door to the attic; pale, resolute, and portentous, with an almost fearsome combination of triumph and seriousness on his face. He assured them that the house had not really been struck, and that the storm would soon be over. They paused, and looking through a window saw that he was indeed right; for the lightning flashed farther and farther off, whilst the trees ceased to bend in the strange frigid gust from the water. The thunder sank to a sort of dull mumbling chuckle and finally died away. Stars came out, and the stamp of triumph on Charles Wards face crystallised into a very singular expression.      For two months or more after this incident Ward was less confined than usual to his laboratory. He exhibited a curious interest in the weather, and made odd inquiries about the date of the spring thawing of the ground. One night late in March he left the house after midnight, and did not return till almost morning; when his mother, being wakeful, heard a rumbling motor draw up to the carriage entrance. Muffled oaths could be distinguished, and Mrs. Ward, rising and going to the window, saw four dark figures removing a long, heavy box from a truck at Charless direction and carrying it within by the side door. She heard laboured breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs, and finally a dull thumping in the attic; after which the footfalls descended again, and the four men reappeared outside and drove off in their truck.      The next day Charles resumed his strict attic seclusion, drawing down the dark shades of his laboratory windows and appearing to be working on some metal substance. He would open the door to no one, and steadfastly refused all proffered food. About noon a wrenching sound followed by a terrible cry and a fall were heard, but when Mrs. Ward rapped at the door her son at length answered faintly, and told her that nothing had gone amiss. The hideous and indescribable stench now welling out was absolutely harmless and unfortunately necessary. Solitude was the one prime essential, and he would appear later for dinner. That afternoon, after the conclusion of some odd hissing sounds which came from behind the locked portal, he did finally appear; wearing an extremely haggard aspect and forbidding anyone to enter the laboratory upon any pretext. This, indeed, proved the beginning of a new policy of secrecy; for never afterward was any other person permitted to visit either the mysterious garret workroom or the adjacent storeroom which he cleaned out, furnished roughly, and added to his inviolably private domain as a sleeping apartment. Here he lived, with books brought up from his library beneath, till the time he purchased the Pawtuxet bungalow and moved to it all his scientific effects.      In the evening Charles secured the paper before the rest of the family and damaged part of it through an apparent accident. Later on Dr. Willett, having fixed the date from statements by various members of the household, looked up an intact copy at the Journal office and found that in the destroyed section the following small item had occurred:Nocturnal Diggers Surprised inNorth Burial GroundRobert Hart, night watchman at the North Burial Ground, this morning discovered a party of several men with a motor truck in the oldest part of the cemetery, but apparently frightened them off before they had accomplished whatever their object may have been.      The discovery took place at about four oclock, when Harts attention was attracted by the sound of a motor outside his shelter. Investigating, he saw a large truck on the main drive several rods away; but could not reach it before the sound of his feet on the gravel had revealed his approach. The men hastily placed a large box in the truck and drove away toward the street before they could be overtaken; and since no known grave was disturbed, Hart believes that this box was an object which they wished to bury.      The diggers must have been at work for a long while before detection, for Hart found an enormous hole dug at a considerable distance back from the roadway in the lot of Amasa Field, where most of the old stones have long ago disappeared. The hole, a place as large and deep as a grave, was empty; and did not coincide with any interment mentioned in the cemetery records.      Sergt. Riley of the Second Station viewed the spot and gave the opinion that the hole was dug by bootleggers rather gruesomely and ingeniously seeking a safe cache for liquor in a place not likely to be disturbed. In reply to questions Hart said he thought the escaping truck had headed up Rochambeau Avenue, though he could not be sure.      During the next few days Ward was seldom seen by his family. Having added sleeping quarters to his attic realm, he kept closely to himself there, ordering food brought to the door and not taking it in until after the servant had gone away. The droning of monotonous formulae and the chanting of bizarre rhythms recurred at intervals, while at other times occasional listeners could detect the sound of tinkling glass, hissing chemicals, running water, or roaring gas flames. Odours of the most unplaceable quality, wholly unlike any before noted, hung at times around the door; and the air of tension observable in the young recluse whenever he did venture briefly forth was such as to excite the keenest speculation. Once he made a hasty trip to the Athenaeum for a book he required, and again he hired a messenger to fetch him a highly obscure volume from Boston. Suspense was written portentously over the whole situation, and both the family and Dr. Willett confessed themselves wholly at a loss what to do or think about it.6.      Then on the fifteenth of April a strange development occurred. While nothing appeared to grow different in kind, there was certainly a very terrible difference in degree; and Dr. Willett somehow attaches great significance to the change. The day was Good Friday, a circumstance of which the servants made much, but which others quite naturally dismiss as an irrelevant coincidence. Late in the afternoon young Ward began repeating a certain formula in a singularly loud voice, at the same time burning some substance so pungent that its fumes escaped over the entire house. The formula was so plainly audible in the hall outside the locked door that Mrs. Ward could not help memorising it as she waited and listened anxiously, and later on she was able to write it down at Dr. Willetts request. It ran as follows, and experts have told Dr. Willett that its very close analogue can be found in the mystic writings of \"Eliphas Levi\", that cryptic soul who crept through a crack in the forbidden door and glimpsed the frightful vistas of the void beyond:\"Per Adonai Eloim, Adonai Jehova,Adonai Sabaoth, Metraton On Agla Mathon,verbum pythonicum, mysterium salamandrae,conventus sylvorum, antra gnomorum,daemonia Coeli Gad, Almousin, Gibor, Jehosua,Evam, Zariatnatmik, veni, veni, veni.\"      This had been going on for two hours without change or intermission when over all the neighbourhood a pandaemoniac howling of dogs set in. The extent of this howling can be judged from the space it received in the papers the next day, but to those in the Ward household it was overshadowed by the odour which instantly followed it; a hideous, all-pervasive odour which none of them had ever smelt before or have ever smelt since. In the midst of this mephitic flood there came a very perceptible flash like that of lightning, which would have been blinding and impressive but for the daylight around; and then was heard the voice that no listener can ever forget because of its thunderous remoteness, its incredible depth, and its eldritch dissimilarity to Charles Wards voice. It shook the house, and was clearly heard by at least two neighbours above the howling of the dogs. Mrs. Ward, who had been listening in despair outside her sons locked laboratory, shivered as she recognised its hellish import; for Charles had told her of its evil fame in dark books, and of the manner in which it had thundered, according to the Fenner letters, above the doomed Pawtuxet farmhouse on the night of Joseph Curwens annihilation. There was no mistaking that nightmare phrase, for Charles had described it too vividly in the old days when he had talked frankly of his Curwen investigations. And yet it was only this fragment of an archaic and forgotten language: \"DIES MIES JESCHET BOENE DOESEF DOUVEMA ENITEMAUS\".      Close upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening of the daylight, though sunset was still an hour distant, and then a puff of added odour different from the first but equally unknown and intolerable. Charles was chanting again now and his mother could hear syllables that sounded like \"Yi-nash-Yog-Sothoth-he-lgeb-fi-throdog\" - ending in a \"Yah!\" whose maniacal force mounted in an ear-splitting crescendo. A second later all previous memories were effaced by the wailing scream which burst out with frantic explosiveness and gradually changed form to a paroxysm of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Mrs. Ward, with the mingled fear and blind courage of maternity, advanced and knocked affrightedly at the concealing panels, but obtained no sign of recognition. She knocked again, but paused nervelessly as a second shriek arose, this one unmistakably in the familiar voice of her son, and sounding concurrently with the still bursting cachinnations of that other voice. Presently she fainted, although she is still unable to recall the precise and immediate cause. Memory sometimes makes merciful deletions.      Mr. Ward returned from the business section at about quarter past six; and not finding his wife downstairs, was told by the frightened servants that she was probably watching at Charless door, from which the sounds had been far stranger than ever before. Mounting the stairs at once, he saw Mrs. Ward stretched at full length on the floor of the corridor outside the laboratory; and realising that she had fainted, hastened to fetch a glass of water from a set bowl in a neighbouring alcove. Dashing the cold fluid in her face, he was heartened to observe an immediate response on her part, and was watching the bewildered opening of her eyes when a chill shot through him and threatened to reduce him to the very state from which she was emerging. For the seemingly silent laboratory was not as silent as it had appeared to be, but held the murmurs of a tense, muffled conversation in tones too low for comprehension, yet of a quality profoundly disturbing to the soul.      It was not, of course, new for Charles to mutter formulae; but this muttering was definitely different. It was so palpably a dialogue, or imitation of a dialogue, with the regular alteration of inflections suggesting question and answer, statement and response. One voice was undisguisedly that of Charles, but the other had a depth and hollowness which the youths best powers of ceremonial mimicry had scarcely approached before. There was something hideous, blasphemous, and abnormal about it, and but for a cry from his recovering wife which cleared his mind by arousing his protective instincts it is not likely that Theodore Howland Ward could have maintained for nearly a year more his old boast that he had never fainted. As it was, he seized his wife in his arms and bore her quickly downstairs before she could notice the voices which had so horribly disturbed him. Even so, however, he was not quick enough to escape catching something himself which caused him to stagger dangerously with his burden. For Mrs. Wards cry had evidently been heard by others than he, and there had come from behind the locked door the first distinguishable words which that masked and terrible colloquy had yielded. They were merely an excited caution in Charless own voice, but somehow their implications held a nameless fright for the father who overheard them. The phrase was just this: \"Sshh! - write!\"      Mr. and Mrs. Ward conferred at some length after dinner, and the former resolved to have a firm and serious talk with Charles that very night. No matter how important the object, such conduct could no longer be permitted; for these latest developments transcended every limit of sanity and formed a menace to the order and nervous well-being of the entire household. The youth must indeed have taken complete leave of his senses, since only downright madness could have prompted the wild screams and imaginary conversations in assumed voices which the present day had brought forth. All this must be stopped, or Mrs. Ward would be made ill and the keeping of servants become an impossibility.      Mr. Ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for Charless laboratory. On the third floor, however, he paused at the sounds which he heard proceeding from the now disused library of his son. Books were apparently being flung about and papers wildly rustled, and upon stepping to the door Mr. Ward beheld the youth within, excitedly assembling a vast armful of literary matter of every size and shape. Charless aspect was very drawn and haggard, and he dropped his entire load with a start at the sound of his fathers voice. At the elder mans command he sat down, and for some time listened to the admonitions he had so long deserved. There was no scene. At the end of the lecture he agreed that his father was right, and that his noises, mutterings, incantations, and chemical odours were indeed inexcusable nuisances. He agreed to a policy of greater quiet, though insisting on a prolongation of his extreme privacy. Much of his future work, he said, was in any case purely book research; and he could obtain quarters elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be necessary at a later stage. For the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed the keenest contrition, and explained that the conversation later heard was part of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental atmosphere. His use of abstruse technical terms somewhat bewildered Mr. Ward, but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and poise despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity. The interview was really quite inconclusive, and as Charles picked up his armful and left the room Mr. Ward hardly knew what to make of the entire business. It was as mysterious as the death of poor old Nig, whose stiffening form had been found an hour before in the basement, with staring eyes and fear-distorted mouth.      Driven by some vague detective instinct, the bewildered parent now glanced curiously at the vacant shelves to see what his son had taken up to the attic. The youths library was plainly and rigidly classified, so that one might tell at a glance the books or at least the kind of books which had been withdrawn. On this occasion Mr. Ward was astonished to find that nothing of the occult or the antiquarian, beyond what had been previously removed, was missing. These new withdrawals were all modern items; histories, scientific treatises, geographies, manuals of literature, philosophic works, and certain contemporary newspapers and magazines. It was a very curious shift from Charles Wards recent run of reading, and the father paused in a growing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense of strangeness. The strangeness was a very poignant sensation, and almost clawed at his chest as he strove to see just what was wrong around him. Something was indeed wrong, and tangibly as well as spiritually so. Ever since he had been in this room he had known that something was amiss, and at last it dawned upon him what it was.      On the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the house in Olney Court, but to the cracked and precariously restored oils of the large Curwen portrait disaster had come. Time and unequal heating had done their work at last, and at some time since the rooms last cleaning the worst had happened. Peeling clear of the wood, curling tighter and tighter, and finally crumbling into small bits with what must have been malignly silent suddenness, the portrait of Joseph Curwen had resigned forever its staring surveillance of the youth it so strangely resembled, and now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust.", "VI.The Dunwich horror itself came between Lammas and the equinox in 1928, and Dr. Armitage was among those who witnessed its monstrous prologue. He had heard, meanwhile, of Whateley’s grotesque trip to Cambridge, and of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy from the Necronomicon at the Widener Library. Those efforts had been in vain, since Armitage had issued warnings of the keenest intensity to all librarians having charge of the dreaded volume. Wilbur had been shockingly nervous at Cambridge; anxious for the book, yet almost equally anxious to get home again, as if he feared the results of being away long.      Early in August the half-expected outcome developed, and in the small hours of the 3d Dr. Armitage was awakened suddenly by the wild, fierce cries of the savage watchdog on the college campus. Deep and terrible, the snarling, half-mad growls and barks continued; always in mounting volume, but with hideously significant pauses. Then there rang out a scream from a wholly different throat—such a scream as roused half the sleepers of Arkham and haunted their dreams ever afterward—such a scream as could come from no being born of earth, or wholly of earth.      Armitage, hastening into some clothing and rushing across the street and lawn to the college buildings, saw that others were ahead of him; and heard the echoes of a burglar-alarm still shrilling from the library. An open window shewed black and gaping in the moonlight. What had come had indeed completed its entrance; for the barking and the screaming, now fast fading into a mixed low growling and moaning, proceeded unmistakably from within. Some instinct warned Armitage that what was taking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to see, so he brushed back the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door. Among the others he saw Professor Warren Rice and Dr. Francis Morgan, men to whom he had told some of his conjectures and misgivings; and these two he motioned to accompany him inside. The inward sounds, except for a watchful, droning whine from the dog, had by this time quite subsided; but Armitage now perceived with a sudden start that a loud chorus of whippoorwills among the shrubbery had commenced a damnably rhythmical piping, as if in unison with the last breaths of a dying man.      The building was full of a frightful stench which Dr. Armitage knew too well, and the three men rushed across the hall to the small genealogical reading-room whence the low whining came. For a second nobody dared to turn on the light, then Armitage summoned up his courage and snapped the switch. One of the three—it is not certain which—shrieked aloud at what sprawled before them among disordered tables and overturned chairs. Professor Rice declares that he wholly lost consciousness for an instant, though he did not stumble or fall.      The thing that lay half-bent on its side in a foetid pool of greenish-yellow ichor and tarry stickiness was almost nine feet tall, and the dog had torn off all the clothing and some of the skin. It was not quite dead, but twitched silently and spasmodically while its chest heaved in monstrous unison with the mad piping of the expectant whippoorwills outside. Bits of shoe-leather and fragments of apparel were scattered about the room, and just inside the window an empty canvas sack lay where it had evidently been thrown. Near the central desk a revolver had fallen, a dented but undischarged cartridge later explaining why it had not been fired. The thing itself, however, crowded out all other images at the time. It would be trite and not wholly accurate to say that no human pen could describe it, but one may properly say that it could not be vividly visualised by anyone whose ideas of aspect and contour are too closely bound up with the common life-forms of this planet and of the three known dimensions. It was partly human, beyond a doubt, with very man-like hands and head, and the goatish, chinless face had the stamp of the Whateleys upon it. But the torso and lower parts of the body were teratologically fabulous, so that only generous clothing could ever have enabled it to walk on earth unchallenged or uneradicated.      Above the waist it was semi-anthropomorphic; though its chest, where the dog’s rending paws still rested watchfully, had the leathery, reticulated hide of a crocodile or alligator. The back was piebald with yellow and black, and dimly suggested the squamous covering of certain snakes. Below the waist, though, it was the worst; for here all human resemblance left off and sheer phantasy began. The skin was thickly covered with coarse black fur, and from the abdomen a score of long greenish-grey tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply. Their arrangement was odd, and seemed to follow the symmetries of some cosmic geometry unknown to earth or the solar system. On each of the hips, deep set in a kind of pinkish, ciliated orbit, was what seemed to be a rudimentary eye; whilst in lieu of a tail there depended a kind of trunk or feeler with purple annular markings, and with many evidences of being an undeveloped mouth or throat. The limbs, save for their black fur, roughly resembled the hind legs of prehistoric earth’s giant saurians; and terminated in ridgy-veined pads that were neither hooves nor claws. When the thing breathed, its tail and tentacles rhythmically changed colour, as if from some circulatory cause normal to the non-human side of its ancestry. In the tentacles this was observable as a deepening of the greenish tinge, whilst in the tail it was manifest as a yellowish appearance which alternated with a sickly greyish-white in the spaces between the purple rings. Of genuine blood there was none; only the foetid greenish-yellow ichor which trickled along the painted floor beyond the radius of the stickiness, and left a curious discolouration behind it.      As the presence of the three men seemed to rouse the dying thing, it began to mumble without turning or raising its head. Dr. Armitage made no written record of its mouthings, but asserts confidently that nothing in English was uttered. At first the syllables defied all correlation with any speech of earth, but toward the last there came some disjointed fragments evidently taken from the Necronomicon, that monstrous blasphemy in quest of which the thing had perished. These fragments, as Armitage recalls them, ran something like “N’gai, n’gha’ghaa, bugg-shoggog, y’hah; Yog-Sothoth, Yog-Sothoth. . . .” They trailed off into nothingness as the whippoorwills shrieked in rhythmical crescendoes of unholy anticipation.      Then came a halt in the gasping, and the dog raised its head in a long, lugubrious howl. A change came over the yellow, goatish face of the prostrate thing, and the great black eyes fell in appallingly. Outside the window the shrilling of the whippoorwills had suddenly ceased, and above the murmurs of the gathering crowd there came the sound of a panic-struck whirring and fluttering. Against the moon vast clouds of feathery watchers rose and raced from sight, frantic at that which they had sought for prey.      All at once the dog started up abruptly, gave a frightened bark, and leaped nervously out of the window by which it had entered. A cry rose from the crowd, and Dr. Armitage shouted to the men outside that no one must be admitted till the police or medical examiner came. He was thankful that the windows were just too high to permit of peering in, and drew the dark curtains carefully down over each one. By this time two policemen had arrived; and Dr. Morgan, meeting them in the vestibule, was urging them for their own sakes to postpone entrance to the stench-filled reading-room till the examiner came and the prostrate thing could be covered up.      Meanwhile frightful changes were taking place on the floor. One need not describe the kind and rate of shrinkage and disintegration that occurred before the eyes of Dr. Armitage and Professor Rice; but it is permissible to say that, aside from the external appearance of face and hands, the really human element in Wilbur Whateley must have been very small. When the medical examiner came, there was only a sticky whitish mass on the painted boards, and the monstrous odour had nearly disappeared. Apparently Whateley had had no skull or bony skeleton; at least, in any true or stable sense. He had taken somewhat after his unknown father."]}
{"id": "EN096", "pair": ["Mantineus-Im more Mr. Briggs, than the I this time.Disclaimer-I own nothing!I\"Im gonna burn.\"Thats when I knew it got really bad. He was always a little nuts, but that. Saying it with an innocent smile and certainty. It sent chills up my spine and I experienced a fear I have not faced in my entire life.It was at this point that I realized that he really was beyond saving.How he got like this, god only knows. Before he was admitted to my sanitarium I checked his background. It was clean. His mother and father were decently sane, as were his grandparents and siblings. I checked hospital files and came up with nothing out of the ordinary. Colds, flu, and a few scrapes. Normal for any boy.Upon his arrival I waited in my office, glancing at the anniversary clock that adorned my desk religiously. Despite its bad memory, I couldnt stand to throw it away, so in my office it has stayed. Poor Lucinda.With annoyance, I watched as an orderly struggled to seat him in a chair. He was antsy and, from what I gathered, he felt he needed to be somewhere else.\"Hello,\" I said gently, hoping to direct his attention on me so that the orderly could strap him in the chair.For my protection as well as his. On the ride here he was without a straitjacket and chipped his nails and teeth trying to escape and then from trying to fatally tear his wrists open with the aforementioned parts. God only knew what he would try to do to me if I stepped out of his line.Finally, we were alone. He thrashed about for a minute before I began.\"Hello,\" I began. \"Im your new doctor.\"From there he stared at me with eyes of steel. It unnerved me; it was like he was looking through me and saw my soul. He kept staring and my psychologists nerve was faltering. Mentally I was panicking and I wondered if, due to his stoic stare, if he was looking deeper than my outer appearance of fear.My childhood flashed before my eyes.\"So doc,\" He began, his voice was gravely and deep. \"Whats your first question?\"This took me by surprise that I had to clear my throat, tap my papers back into place, and start again.\"Yes, well. You see, Ive checked your records, Mr.-\"\"Dont say it!\" He screamed, face twisting into pure, unimaginable fear. \"They might not know Im here!\"\"Whos they?\"His snapped. As if the fearful shell broke and revealed this manic, demented smile. It seemed sadistic and menacing, yet what he said was pure jibber-jabber.\"Them, doc!\" He said. His face changed again; he was stumped. \"You mean you dont know, doc? Surely youve encountered others like me.\"\"No,\" I agreed. \"Im afraid I havent.\"He began to laugh. It was long and insane. Yet, as abruptly as it began, it ended and he could have passed for a sane person within that silent second.\"Then give up this case, doc.\" He said, a chuckle escaping his throat. \"Give it to someone who knows!\"If only I listened.IIAs the sessions progressed, I admit to feeling a slight disheartenment. He would reveal nothing of his condition other than ramblings like before. Though, one day he did something of note.He was rocking back and forth in a big, exaggerated way. He would swing forward, mumble something then swing back and shout a made up word.For example, on his first forward rock he would mumble something akin to a sneeze then shout \"Fhtagn!\" Yog-soth \"Fhtagn!\" Oz-soth \"Fhtagn!\"He then began to say another strange word, of which I surmised were names, when he stopped. He got so far as \"Nya\" when he began to giggle like a lunatic and rock his torso rapidly while repeating that strange made up word.\"Fhtagn! Fhtagn! Fhtagn!\"\"Mr.-\"He began to scream as if in agony. From previous sessions, I knew it was most likely from my trying to utter his name. But, unlike previous times where he would instantly stop, he began to sob. His face flushed crimson, his eyes became slits from whence tears began to flow.\"The Necronomicon!\" He screamed, his sobs becoming more intense. \"De…Destroy….Destroy it!\"\"What?\"\"Destroy the Necronomicon!\" He shouted, he looked a mixture of agony and rage. \"Destroy it! Destroy that damn book!\"Five minutes after that outburst he stopped. Despite the still flushed face and teary eyes, he looked as if it never happened. And with that deep, gravelly voice he spoke.\"Destroy it doc.\" The intense glare he gave me sent me flashes of hellfire and promises of pain and horror the likes of which Ill never comprehend.\"Destroy it. Dont look at it, dont read it, and-whatever you do-Dont look at the back page!\"Two sessions after that he seemed to follow back into our usual routine. That is, until our third. It was then that he said what I knew was the truth. He was gone to the sane world. And despite our other methods, they would not be enough to bring him back.\"Im gonna burn.\" He said, then, with an exaggerated nod he began. \"Yep. Im gonna burn that damn book.\"\"And why would you burn it?\" I asked.He clammed up.Miskatonic University. I have been there, of course, as a student of psychology. Hoping to better myself in understanding the people around me; a curse of a recluse, Im afraid. Though I have never heard of such a book, my curiosity had gotten the better of me and I sent a letter to the Miskatonic Library.A few days later a package arrived for me with a note. The Librarian was slightly against me looking at it, but considering my profession, she allowed it. But I was to return it within a timely manner. I did not flip through it. I cannot explain why, but I felt a sense of doom upon glancing at the ancient tome.But, at least, I had something to talk about in our next session.III\"I have the book.\" I started.His eyes picked up. He smiled like a child at Christmas morning before unwrapping his gifts. He started to shake the chair he was chained to. Rapidly he asked questions like \"You didnt read it did you?\" and \"Did you burn it? If you did, can I see the ashes?\"\"No, I didnt read it.\" I confessed. \"Nor,\" I placed the book on my desk. \"Have I burned it; as you can see.\"\"Burn it!\" He shouted. \"Burn it!\"His eyes grew wide in fear.\"Theyll be coming! They sense its presence! Its an unholy beacon! Burn it! Burn it and destroy their only chance for this world!\"\"Not yet.\" I said. \"Not until you tell me why such a normal man would succumb to madness without any reason.\"His emotions changed from frantic to anger in a flash. He started to growl and shake the chair more violently. Either it is due to the cases similar to a grandmother gaining superhuman strength when their grandchild is in danger, or perhaps they did not switch the chains and after dealing with his constant mood swings, they gave. Either way, he was free.Free and wild, like a bull, he charged towards me. I dont know what compelled me to throw the book, but I did. I threw it before he was upon it. And I know, right there, I made a mistake.For when it landed, it landed on the last page where an artists rendition of the writer was present. I stared upon it, mouth agape.\"No!\" He shouted. \"Its all over now.\" He began to sob. \"I didnt want to do this!\" He then sparked up, looking hopeful. \"Wait! Its not too late! You can still reject it! Reject the responsibility and let humanity thrive!\"\"What are you talking about?\" I managed to say.My mind was beginning to form an explanation as to why the famous \"Mad Arab\" looked like me.\"Yes, traitor, what are you talking about?\"\"Nyar…\"He cracked up. \"Nyar…\" He chuckled like a mad man.The new comer was dressed in Ancient Egyptian robes and crown. He was magnificent and regal in appearance. But another sense took over and I wanted to run away from him as quickly as possible. But something caught my eye. Without the help of hand or wind, the pages began to flip back until it reached its goal. The page prior had a picture of him as he was seen now. To the right were the bold words:Nyarlathotep: The Crawling ChaosHe turned towards me. Within those cold black eyes I could see a swirling mass, similar to a galaxy, only different. And, if I strained my ears, I swore I heard the mad playing of deranged flautists.\"Do forgive me, Abdul.\" He said. \"But…\"\"Thats not my name.\" I began. \"My name is…\"\"Not important.\" He said, cutting me off. \"What is, is who you were and who you are meant to be. Abdul Hazred, the Mad Arab and priest to both Cthulhu and Yog-Sothoth.\"Flashes of desert expanses flew by within my mind. A lone man walked alone the desert, walking through an old, abandoned city that once belonged to a reptilian race of humanoids. How he dedicated his remaining years(which was not many) to write the book of which they wanted and whos information he gained through dreams and through physical means.He died and his soul became one with Yog-Sothoth until thirty-four years ago. I was plagued with nightmares and horrible sights that now no longer fill me with dread. Though what my parents did still leaves a mark. But then again, it happened to Abdul, too.(1)\"What is needed of me, Oh mighty Nyarlathotep?\"\"No!\" He shouted, but Nyarlathotep shot him an angry glare.\"I will deal with you later.\" He turned and faced me once more. \"But for now, Abdul must be briefed on what is expected of him.\"You have written The Necronomicon rather well. But, They now wish for you to write one more piece to it. This one will explain what will happen once They are awakened and how to stop the stars from changing again. Youll receive these in dreams once more. But this time, youll receive help in the form of Mr. Briggs, there.\"He cowered in fear of his own surname.\"That is, if you need help.\"\"No,\" I said. \"I shall write this myself. Besides, you called him a traitor. He is not fit to help write such a glorious book.\"\"No!\" He shouted. He had a letter opener in his hands. He was digging through my desk while we were talking. \"He will not write the missing chapter!\"He lunged at me, but was stopped by a loud buzzing sound.\"Id run if I were you.\" Nyarlathotep said.Mr. Briggs did not heed his warning, and lunged at me once more. A Mi-go crashed through the window and grabbed him with his crab-like claws and whisked him out of my office and the sanitarium all together, being prepared for his trip to Yuggoth.\"Do not disappoint me.\" He said and vanished.------ ------1) I know, according to historians, that Abdul Hazred was actually Lovecraft. But, since hes a made up character, why not give him a made up childhood? I am not implying that he was beaten as a child!", "The ShoggothI had met Professor Kindle during my explorations in my youth in Berlin at a convention. His theories in such subjects as physics and anatomy were peculiar to me-and to his chagrin-his colleges as well.\"Well, my boy,\" He said upon my asking why everyone seemed to mock him. \"These fools do not wish to see whats so plain that if it were a snake, it would most assuredly bite them.\"Upon that introduction, he had began to tell me how certain miniscule particles held the universe together. What he said went beyond dark matter and such unexplained universal secrets that it was almost hard to believe. But I can tell you, he was convincing. A fact that will later cause me to rethink my pursuits.\"You see, my boy, Yog-Sothoth particles and Azathoth particles exist in sub matter, in a way that can go undetected even more so than the elusive dark matter for it obviously does not refract or twist light in any such matter like anything else in space.\"\"Then how does one know of their existence?\" I asked, and for the fourth time: \"And why those names?\"It was odd to me to think that such a thing would exist that does not interact upon its surroundings. And what was queer was that the names did not follow the standard scientific tradition of Latin roots; instead appearing to be from some alien language.He smiled. \"Come, my boy, I shall show you.\" He draped an arm over my shoulders. \"And as for the names; they are from the Necromicon. A book I doubt you have read, but the names fit, believe me. For you see, Azathoth represents chaos, and Yog-Sothoth order; its like the Chinese philosophy of Yin and Yang, a philosophy I find as very true.\"Kindle took me to his hotel room where he produced from a brown briefcase, a telescope. It looked like any telescope that one could easily obtain from any store for cheap. Yet, something was off. A minor defect, yet hardly noticeable except in the right light. There was an angle of odd proportions etched out of glass and sealed within between the two lenses.\"Look, look.\" He said excitedly.I did look. And what I saw amazed me more than frightened me; as many introductory things do. What appeared to be bubbles and globular orbs of wiggling ganglia-like tentacles were stuck together. I took my eye away.\"And how do you know it keeps the universe together?\"\"It goes in a straight line across the sky.\" He said. \"Granted, its mere speculation, but I believe it to be correct, for, how many things are a perfect line in a vacuum?\"I was unable to disagree.After that, our interactions consisted of an odd letter or two. I became a physician and he became a recluse due to his latest published work that was about his Azathoth and Yog-Sothoth particles. He would only ever briefly say what he was working on. I guess he thought me a fellow conspirator, a rebel to the newly founded scientific idea; anything out of the norm is false, to the point he sent me a battered copy of the Necromicon.I read the book, horrified at what I was reading, that I am still surprised that I did not throw it to the floor and burn it. But the next letter just asked a question:Did you read it?I replied in the positive and the next response was an invitation to his little house in the sparsely populated hills of New England. I will not tell of my travels to his one story house that surprised me that such a man would live there.It was a dilapidated house that looked like time and hillbilly inhabitants before him had a wild party, trashing it beyond any sense of repairing it. When I knocked on the door and my friend opened it, I was greeted with the sight of the inside, which appeared only slightly better than the outside. The wallpaper was peeling, everything was dusty, and the lights were working, yet did not seem to help alleviate the gloom that seemed to settle upon the house in a death grip.\"Ah, its so good to see you, my boy.\" He greeted me, allowing me into the house. \"Come, please sit. I have some tea prepared for your arrival.\"I take the offered liquid and he sits on the armchair across from me. He takes a sip of his tea before setting it down upon the arm of his chair, his finger never leaving the handle.\"I invited you here to see my newest discovery.\" He said, an intense look aimed at me. Like an excited madman holding a gun.\"What is it?\"\"Shoggoths,\"He said that one word, never explaining anything, letting the dreadful word sink into my mind.\"Granted,\" He took another sip. \"I didnt discover them. But there was something that eluded me. A phrase; anyone could over look it, but I didnt. Tekeli-li.\" He almost mimicked a robot.My face turned pale at that word. Instinctual fear ingrown and nearly forgotten, left burrowed into a level of subconscious was unearthed and made me want to run faster than I have ever ran in my entire life. I knew I should have listened to it, but curiosity had gotten the better of me.\"The purpose behind it,\" Kindle continued as if there were no tension in the air. \"Eluded me. Until I started thinking in terms of wolves. Theyre very much alike, you know. Sleek killing machines with a high intelligence(though to-say-Cthulhu or Azathoth, they are stupid).\"With an interesting way to communicate.\" He smirked. \"I was proven correct by mere chance. I spied a shoggoth all alone. It cried out Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li! Another cried out in response, but this one angrier. The first spoke out and went about doing chores.\"\"Thats interesting, Kindle.\" I said. \"But how does this have to do with wolves? They howl to alert members of their pack of their location.\"\"Yes,\" Kindle said matter-of-factly. \"But wolves also have growls and other vocal ways of communicating. Shoggoths only have the one word. And to prove it, I took two Shoggoths and placed them in something similar to a rat maze.\"\"But how did you catch them?\"\"Doesnt matter.\" He snapped. \"Now let me finish, my friend.\"\"One called out and the other started to move and call out as well. This continued until they found each other. It wasnt until I caught more that I made the most startling information about them.\"My body trembles. I can only imagine what else he could have discovered about those loathsome creatures.\"I had caught six or seven of them. I crammed them into this one room below this house. It was getting cramped in there for them, so these two decided to fuse together. And it hit me! Theyre fragments! Their hive mind-like behavior, their similarities. Everything!\"\"Come, Ill show you.\"\"No,\" I snap, standing. \"Id rather not.\"Kindle becomes angered by my outburst. He grabs my arm tightly and tries to drag me towards the cellar, but I resist.\"Come, come, there is nothing to be afraid of.\"\"There is.\" I said. \"Shoggoths…\"I was cut off by a loud thunder from under our feet. Kindle pales as it happens again. He breaks from my arm and tries to run into the kitchen but he never makes it. A long, large, slimy black tentacle rises from the hole it made in the floor. I notice in sick fascination that a black, tar-like substance drips off of it. It darts towards the sound of Kindles running feet and wraps around his leg, forcing him to land, face first, onto the floor.I watch, dumb, as it drags my friend towards the hole. Kindle screams and begs me to help him, but I dont move. Fear plagues me, cementing my feet to the wood floor. It is not until his struggling form sinks into the hole that my feet can work again and I dart out of the house.Tekeli-li!(1)AAAhhhhhhhh!(1)1) These were larger(font 22), but the site messes with me!Mantineus-The ending is ambiguous by default. You see, our hero makes it out. What you see is The Shuggoth and Kindles dying scream."]}
{"id": "EN083", "pair": ["The world we live in is not as it seems. I, James White, write this document so that others may be made aware of what I have experienced and know of the dangers that lurk beneath our limited perception of \"reality\". Whether you believe me or not, dear reader, is up to you. I only ask that you read what I write with an open mind since I write, not for my own gain, but to warn you of what I can only describe as \"pure evil\".I had never heard of the \"Cult of Cthulhu\" before I began university in the late summer of 2012. I was only eighteen years old, an atheist, and dogmatically pursued scientific understanding and knowledge. At that time, I was not in the least bit interested in weird cults and other religious movements, which I simply dismissed as primitive superstition. Had I but known what I would encounter, I would have burnt the science textbook, prayed to God for the strength not to crumble into insanity and got as far away from that university as I could!The strange happenings started less than two months into my first term. I had been put into student accommodation and shared a corridor with four other boys and two girls. I had got to know my flatmates very well until all of a sudden, one of the boys by the name of Jonathan Mears disappeared. This wasnt looked upon as weird at first since Jonathan was the quiet type anyway and often spent long hours alone in his room. The suspicions arose however, when he hadnt shown his face for three days. His absence was brought up one evening as we sat in a communal area.\"Hes probably just been very busy lately,\" my best friend, Jacob Shields, said. \"You know Jonathan. When he sets his mind on something, he doesnt stop until hes achieved whatever hes trying to do.\"\"Isnt it a bit strange though?\" Annie Roberts, a lovely blonde girl from the room directly across the corridor asked. \"I mean, hes in our corridor and we havent seen him for ages. Not even in the kitchen or lecture halls.\"\"It isnt like him to miss a lecture,\" I agreed. Jacob merely waved these concerns away.\"If we havent seen him by tomorrow evening, well go to the reception and see whats happening,\" he said cheerfully.But Jonathan didnt show up the following day and, as planned, my entire corridor went to the reception desk to ask if anything had happened to him. The receptionist, an elderly lady, checked through the files on a computer before looking up at us.\"Im afraid he has left the university,\" she informed us. \"He dropped out four days ago.\"\"Well there you go!\" Jacob exclaimed. \"Nothing to worry about!\"But there was something to worry about. Even though I now had every reason to think that Jonathan was fine, I couldnt shake that feeling of foreboding. He had seemed happy in university and was consistently getting high marks so I resolved to check things out for myself.I waited until 3:00 the following morning, and in the darkness, I tiptoed along the corridor to Jonathans room. Using a paperclip, I carefully picked the lock on his door and let myself in. I closed the door behind me and switched on the light. The sight that greeted me came as a huge shock. Clothes still lay on the floor, the bed was made, books were still on the shelves and a laptop was still humming gently on the cluttered desk. In short, it looked as though Jonathan was simply out of the room. If he had gone home, why did he leave all his things behind? And if he hadnt, where was he and why did the university records state that he had? Deeply concerned, I left the room and returned to my own. I lay awake in the darkness pondering the thoughts in my head and finally decided that I needed to find out what had happened and that I would do so alone...", "II.It was in the township of Dunwich, in a large and partly inhabited farmhouse set against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile and a half from any other dwelling, that Wilbur Whateley was born at 5 A.M. on Sunday, the second of February, 1913. This date was recalled because it was Candlemas, which people in Dunwich curiously observe under another name; and because the noises in the hills had sounded, and all the dogs of the countryside had barked persistently, throughout the night before. Less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother was one of the decadent Whateleys, a somewhat deformed, unattractive albino woman of thirty-five, living with an aged and half-insane father about whom the most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered in his youth. Lavinia Whateley had no known husband, but according to the custom of the region made no attempt to disavow the child; concerning the other side of whose ancestry the country folk might—and did—speculate as widely as they chose. On the contrary, she seemed strangely proud of the dark, goatish-looking infant who formed such a contrast to her own sickly and pink-eyed albinism, and was heard to mutter many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous future.      Lavinia was one who would be apt to mutter such things, for she was a lone creature given to wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and trying to read the great odorous books which her father had inherited through two centuries of Whateleys, and which were fast falling to pieces with age and worm-holes. She had never been to school, but was filled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore that Old Whateley had taught her. The remote farmhouse had always been feared because of Old Whateley’s reputation for black magic, and the unexplained death by violence of Mrs. Whateley when Lavinia was twelve years old had not helped to make the place popular. Isolated among strange influences, Lavinia was fond of wild and grandiose day-dreams and singular occupations; nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares in a home from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since disappeared.      There was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises and the dogs’ barking on the night Wilbur was born, but no known doctor or midwife presided at his coming. Neighbours knew nothing of him till a week afterward, when Old Whateley drove his sleigh through the snow into Dunwich Village and discoursed incoherently to the group of loungers at Osborn’s general store. There seemed to be a change in the old man—an added element of furtiveness in the clouded brain which subtly transformed him from an object to a subject of fear—though he was not one to be perturbed by any common family event. Amidst it all he shewed some trace of the pride later noticed in his daughter, and what he said of the child’s paternity was remembered by many of his hearers years afterward.      “I dun’t keer what folks think—ef Lavinny’s boy looked like his pa, he wouldn’t look like nothin’ ye expeck. Ye needn’t think the only folks is the folks hereabaouts. Lavinny’s read some, an’ has seed some things the most o’ ye only tell abaout. I calc’late her man is as good a husban’ as ye kin find this side of Aylesbury; an’ ef ye knowed as much abaout the hills as I dew, ye wouldn’t ast no better church weddin’ nor her’n. Let me tell ye suthin’—some day yew folks’ll hear a child o’ Lavinny’s a-callin’ its father’s name on the top o’ Sentinel Hill!”      The only persons who saw Wilbur during the first month of his life were old Zechariah Whateley, of the undecayed Whateleys, and Earl Sawyer’s common-law wife, Mamie Bishop. Mamie’s visit was frankly one of curiosity, and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations; but Zechariah came to lead a pair of Alderney cows which Old Whateley had bought of his son Curtis. This marked the beginning of a course of cattle-buying on the part of small Wilbur’s family which ended only in 1928, when the Dunwich horror came and went; yet at no time did the ramshackle Whateley barn seem overcrowded with livestock. There came a period when people were curious enough to steal up and count the herd that grazed precariously on the steep hillside above the old farmhouse, and they could never find more than ten or twelve anaemic, bloodless-looking specimens. Evidently some blight or distemper, perhaps sprung from the unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi and timbers of the filthy barn, caused a heavy mortality amongst the Whateley animals. Odd wounds or sores, having something of the aspect of incisions, seemed to afflict the visible cattle; and once or twice during the earlier months certain callers fancied they could discern similar sores about the throats of the grey, unshaven old man and his slatternly, crinkly-haired albino daughter.      In the spring after Wilbur’s birth Lavinia resumed her customary rambles in the hills, bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy child. Public interest in the Whateleys subsided after most of the country folk had seen the baby, and no one bothered to comment on the swift development which that newcomer seemed every day to exhibit. Wilbur’s growth was indeed phenomenal, for within three months of his birth he had attained a size and muscular power not usually found in infants under a full year of age. His motions and even his vocal sounds shewed a restraint and deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant, and no one was really unprepared when, at seven months, he began to walk unassisted, with falterings which another month was sufficient to remove.      It was somewhat after this time—on Hallowe’en—that a great blaze was seen at midnight on the top of Sentinel Hill where the old table-like stone stands amidst its tumulus of ancient bones. Considerable talk was started when Silas Bishop—of the undecayed Bishops—mentioned having seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother about an hour before the blaze was remarked. Silas was rounding up a stray heifer, but he nearly forgot his mission when he fleetingly spied the two figures in the dim light of his lantern. They darted almost noiselessly through the underbrush, and the astonished watcher seemed to think they were entirely unclothed. Afterward he could not be sure about the boy, who may have had some kind of a fringed belt and a pair of dark trunks or trousers on. Wilbur was never subsequently seen alive and conscious without complete and tightly buttoned attire, the disarrangement or threatened disarrangement of which always seemed to fill him with anger and alarm. His contrast with his squalid mother and grandfather in this respect was thought very notable until the horror of 1928 suggested the most valid of reasons.      The next January gossips were mildly interested in the fact that “Lavinny’s black brat” had commenced to talk, and at the age of only eleven months. His speech was somewhat remarkable both because of its difference from the ordinary accents of the region, and because it displayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of three or four might well be proud. The boy was not talkative, yet when he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpossessed by Dunwich and its denizens. The strangeness did not reside in what he said, or even in the simple idioms he used; but seemed vaguely linked with his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the spoken sounds. His facial aspect, too, was remarkable for its maturity; for though he shared his mother’s and grandfather’s chinlessness, his firm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression of his large, dark, almost Latin eyes to give him an air of quasi-adulthood and well-nigh preternatural intelligence. He was, however, exceedingly ugly despite his appearance of brilliancy; there being something almost goatish or animalistic about his thick lips, large-pored, yellowish skin, coarse crinkly hair, and oddly elongated ears. He was soon disliked even more decidedly than his mother and grandsire, and all conjectures about him were spiced with references to the bygone magic of Old Whateley, and how the hills once shook when he shrieked the dreadful name of Yog-Sothoth in the midst of a circle of stones with a great book open in his arms before him. Dogs abhorred the boy, and he was always obliged to take various defensive measures against their barking menace."]}

The line was from an old song from the soundtrack of an old Japanese anime that had confused and depressed the hell out of him. He shook his head, Heavens Not Enough, Steve Conte, Wolfs Rain soundtrack, No... there had been two soundtracks for that series, this was the first song on the second. Why wasnt it called Wolves Rain? He thought, trying to dispel the sad song, but it played on, and he was even singing softly toward the songs end...Cause I couldnt cryCause I turned awayCouldnt see the scoreDidnt know the painOf leaving yesterday really far behindin another lifein another dreamBy a different namegave it all away for a memory and a quiet lieand I felt the face Of the cold tonightStill dont know the scoreBut I know the painOf leaving everything really far behind ...Thus distracted, he did not see Dahlman.The sorcerer was a servant of the He Who Gnaws in The Darkness. Azathoth was neither ally nor enemy to Cthulhu, he was actually his Great-Grandfather having sired both Yog-Sothoth and Shub-Niggurath, who had sired Nug and Yeb, Nug being Cthulhus parent by parthogenesis. Azathoths worshipers, however, tended to be madmen in the truest sense. He was a mindless entity, neither desiring nor rewarding worship. Some of the gods who danced round and round his throne often took it upon themselves to accept his worship and grant gifts in his behalf. Especially Nyarlathotep...The Outer Gods were the key. Humans were a weak species, helpless in the face of even the least of The Great Old Ones. But by learning, by studying the Outer Gods, by utilizing their power, a human could assume a form of divinity themselves. For decades Dahlman had faithfully studied the ancient texts, The Book of Eibon, The Necronomicon, The Book of Iod, and he had learned to harness the power of those who lurked mindless and blind beyond the thin veil of reality. And now he would prove his worth, he would bring down an immortal, the child of a god...A bolt of lightning shook Torren-Wraeth from his revery, it barely hurt, but he could tell it was not natural. He turned to see a black-clad figuring closing in upon him, and erected a Deflect Harm even as the human struck out with Fist of Yog-Sothoth. \"Okay, now youre annoying me.\" Torren-Wraeth lashed out with Implant Fear, hoping to avoid having to actually kill this irrational attacker. He disliked sorcerers, but he also disliked having to harm people. But the madman had cast Deflect Harm upon himself, and, thus protected, struck back with The Dread Curse of Azathoth. Torren-Wraeth reeled, Now that hurt! Enraged, Torren-Wraeth physically rushed the sorcerer, ignoring the protective amulet the man held out, and punched him square in the nose, breaking it. Distracted by the pain, Dahlman fell before Implant Fear.Dahlmans mind was instantly overwhelmed with unimaginable fear and he turned to flee, all spells forgotten in his terror, only to run into a golden monstrosity streaking toward him in the dawning sky. He called frantically upon his gods to save him. But these were not benevolent gods, they were fickle, and enjoyed granting lesser beings great power, just to have the pleasure of snatching it away. His gods deserted him mid-flight, his skin shriveled and shrank tight against his bones as he aged in seconds. The capricious Outer Gods no doubt laughed as their former ward fell into the sea, and was immediately set upon by sharks.Torren-Wraeth and Tek watched impassively as the dying sorcerer fell into the sea.\"Who was that?\"\"I have no idea.\"\"And I thought you were in trouble.\"\"Sorry.\"\"You do get in the strangest situations.\" Tek observed wryly.\"Sorry.\"Youve made me late, you know.\"\"Sorry about that.\"\"Its okay, I could use the break. A word of advice, never marry a woman with five mouths.\"Both Tek and Torren-Wraeth laughed.Ho Fong arched an eyebrow as he saw the disheveled Torren-Wraeth accompanying Lord Tektaktequataquarl. Hed seen him before, of course, he occasionally visited alongside Tek, though his distaste for the ritual sacrifices of human beings was clearly evident. Fortunately, no such events were scheduled. \"Are you alright, Lord Torren-Wraeth?\" He knew better than to call him simply Torren or Wraeth. \"Ill be all right, Master Ho,\" Torren-Wraeth said with perfect Chinese courtesy, \"But I would be most grateful for a place to rest for a while.\" Ho Fong smiled, \"Of course,\" he turned, \"Ping, take lord Torren-Wraeth to one of the guest areas and provide him with whatever refreshments he requires.\" A youngish monk, dressed in the standard yellow and black silk, stepped forward and led Torren-Wraeth deeper into the monastery.It was instantly obvious to Torren-Wraeth that Ping was not Chinese, at least, not in the ethnic sense. He was one of the dreaded Tcho-Tcho people, descendants of toad-like creatures created by the Great Old One Chaugnar Faugn and human cultists. The Tcho-Tcho had an evil reputation, one well earned. The vast majority of them served the Great Old Ones, and many practiced cannibalism. There were exceptions, of course, not all Tcho-Tcho were evil or insane, but those individuals were usually outcasts, hated and sometimes even hunted by their own people. As they walked, Torren-Wraeth halted for a moment before an idol of carved black stone. It was well-crafted and incredibly detailed, lean muscled and lanky, wings extended, the webbed hands held palm up like a divine supplicant, the curving trunk-mouth lifted upward as if it were sounding a call. A call to Death itself, for this was Shugoran, The Herald of Death, worshiped and feared by the Tcho-Tcho people. Ping knelt reverently then hurried Torren-Wraeth into a nearby chamber.The scent of Black Lotus was thick in the air as the monks shut the great copper door behind Tek. \"You really shouldnt smoke you know,\" he said casually, \"Terrible for the lungs...\" The Bloated Woman rose from her cushions, \"Only if you are a mortal, which I am not.\" Tek smiled, then shed his semblance of humanity, becoming a writhing, shapeless mass of golden flesh, golden tentacles, golden eyes and pearly white fangs. \"What of our child?\" Several mouths spoke at once. The Goddess came closer with a grace unfitting such an obese creature. \"Nothing can harm our offspring.\" \"How long, do you think?\" The Bloated Woman stopped, apparently this visit was for business, not pleasure. \"It is impossible to tell. I have born some children within days of conception, and others within centuries.\" She sensed a slight jealous possessiveness on the part of the Hastur-Spawn, he wanted her as his sole mate, an amusing and archaic notion, not often seen in a True-Blood. The fact that he knew she had devoured most of the former lovers did not apparently assuage this unseemly feeling. \"I feel that this one will be born within a month or two...\" She grinned horribly with all five mouths, \"How has your father reacted?\" \"Our child will be welcome in Carcosa.\" Hastur, in truth, was somewhat worried, fearing that the child would be another avatar of Nyarlathotep, that the Crawling Chaos would use the child as yet another form in which to manifest itself. In other words, he feared that Nyarlathotep would give birth to itself...For all the vile practices that went on in the Monastery of The Bloated Woman, it was a beautiful place, richly decorated in jade and silver, gold and silk. Yellow and black, every strand of silk in the monastery was either yellow or black. The yellow made for a much friendlier environment than the dark, ominous stones of RLyeh. The Goddess favored those colors, for some reason. Torren-Wraeth remembered something Goro had once said. Among his people and several other Asian cultures, yellow was the color of mourning. Black meant death and mourning in the West, yellow filled that role in the East. Was it intentional? Probably, but he was a guest, and it would be rude to question his hosts. He changed from his slightly charred clothing into the yellow and black robes that had been kindly provided him and stepped out into the hallway. There he saw Ping once again kneeling before Shugoran.", "Joseph Clayton watched from his seat on the center aisle as Pete Tallier finished his act. The young man had performed a folk-dance from his ancestral Quebec, a homeland his family had left more than a century ago for jobs in the New England furniture industry. He himself had finished his act more than an hour ago, having opted for a simple folk dance and traditional Norman costume with a top hat. Of course, using a hat-rack instead of a dancing partner had been a bit... unusual; with Marie being so involved in her own routine, he had had to make do with what he could get.But now, as Joseph finished clapping in approval of the previous act, he realized that his girlfriend was due to come on. What would actually happen was a complete mystery to Joseph; Marie had kept a tight lid on her act by practicing at home and while she had spent much less time with him than normal, she had stressed how important this was for her. So, respecting her wishes, hed kept his distance and wished her luck. Now, with his parents sitting beside him, the Trinhs just across the aisle and after weeks of mystery, he was finally about to discover what the big secret was.The male student in charge of the event came forward after Tallier left the stage, dressed in traditional Greek costume. \"Next up is Marie Trinh, who will be performing a traditional journey rite in two parts from the Annamite Mountains of Vietnam and Laos. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you The Stork Dance!\" He exited downstage right as the lights dimmed even further than they had, the only illumination the bright center of the spotlight focused on the place he had been. Slowly, almost dramatically, the spotlight edged back towards the rear wall until it revealed a lone figure wrapped in a white cloak, face obscured by something.Utter silence pervaded the auditorium before the sound system gave off the squeal of a needle scratching on a record and the sounds of soft, high flutes began wafting upon the air. It was then that the figure started walking forward on bare feet, segmented anklets of carved jade just visible below the hem of the long, black skirt while the white cloak draped over the arms and... it almost looked like some sort of hat or strange mask was concealing the figures head. Suddenly, pipes of a lower pitch, possibly oboes, started playing a mournful tune and the figure stopped suddenly, lifting its head to face the crowd.A spoonbill... with a black beak. So that was what that big fuss with the paper-mache was about.The dance was in two parts. The first was a mournful, melancholy arrangement that supposedly was intended for farewell ceremonies. Zithers, oboes, various other instruments of the right mood and the creaky, brittle, almost sad songs of old women set the tone for the dance, a carefully choreographed routine that either imitated the intricate placement of a wading birds steps or imitated the slow soaring of those same birds. This was the Song of Departure. The second part, that of Arrival, was more...upbeat in its cadence. After the record was flipped, the plucking of lutes and brighter zithers, the delicate clanging of some sort of bells, jollier wind instruments and the celebratory singing of young women replaced the melancholy mood of earlier. The dancers steps also changed, with sudden, sprightly movements becoming the norm as imitations of courtship displays and feeding were performed.Throughout the dance, the audience had been enraptured by what was happening onstage. While Joseph was certainly enjoying his girlfriends act, he was not so enraptured that he failed to notice that several very strange things were happening in the darkened theater. The first change he noticed was the background odor. Slowly, over the course of the act, the smell in the theater had changed from the dry, dusty smell of upholstery and the hot metal of lighting equipment to... well, there was river mud, water thick with life, plants growing in the sun and warm wind. It wasnt a bad smell, but there was no real way that it could be coming from anywhere in the building.Other strange things were... shapes in the darkness. During the first part of the dance Joseph could have sworn that he glimpsed shadowy shapes moving in the aisle beside him, shapes that almost looked like... wading birds. During the second act, he could almost imagine that the silvery shapes of gliding birds were being outlined by the residual glare from the spotlight, though that could easily be passed off as wafting dust.Except that there wasnt that much dust in the theater.Thirdly, and much less unusually, an elderly man with thinning, almost white curly hair, wire rim spectacles and a short beard was watching the performance with interest, almost... studying it. Joseph had never seen him in the town before, so who was he and why was he here?And had he or anyone else seen the apparitions?When the dance was done and Marie (who had revealed herself at the end of the dance by taking off her headdress and taking a bow) had left the stage, Joseph kept thinking on that thought during the remaining acts. The smell had faded and gone, the shadows and shapes were no longer there but the mere hint of their possibility shook him. He was a person of science, of logic, of well-produced nature documentaries; in the real world, things like this did not happen outside the heads of crazy people.However... the very thought of the ghostly shapes thrilled Joseph, filled him with fantastic wonders and terrors not felt since he was a boy of five. And, thought the young man, it did not truly matter if it was wonderful or terrible, or if Marie could control or even knew about this sort of stuff. All that truly mattered was that... well, at the level of base wonderment, the entire experience was remarkably exciting.Sinister? Maybe. Normal? Not in the least. But very definitely exciting.But... maybe it would be best not to mention it until Marie brought it up.LaterAfter the show, as students were putting away their costumes and props and donning their late-autumn outerwear, Joseph approached his girlfriend who, with dress, cloak and headpiece in a garment bag, was heading out the door after her parents. \"Hey, Marie... about what you did on stage tonight?\"\"Yes?\" Questioned Marie as she turned towards Joseph. As a courtesy, he would never mention it but he could tell that something was weighing on her mind. The impression that she was on the very edge of flight made it seem that, perhaps, she was aware that strange things had happened.Strange things... but not necessarily bad things.\"I just have to say that you really hit a crowd pleaser tonight. I dont think any of the other acts got as much applause as yours did.\" With that, Joseph saw Maries face lighten from the mask of apprehension that had been there into a gratified smile.\"Thanks. You wouldnt believe how grueling the practicing was and then the costume and making all those fake pendants and charms... after all that, I was hoping it would get a good reception.\" With that, she turned back and began walking out into the early night air, over to the parking space where her parents had parked their combination commercial van and personal conveyance.Joseph had actively resisted losing himself in the weirdness that had struck him in the auditorium. However, he could never resist losing himself in his girlfriends smile.Perhaps because one was familiar and one was a bit... odd.Running to catch up with Marie, he wanted to ask his girlfriend something. \"On a different subject, I was wondering if you were doing anything tonight. Maybe we could catch a movie, go bowling, something like that.\"\"Id like to but I really cant.\" They were almost at the Trinhs van when Marie leaned in close to Joseph to whisper conspiratorially. \"Dad got a call from the cops when the Polish guy was on. They arrested someone vandalizing the front of the shop, and well probably be busy all night with statements, forms, the insurance guys and all the other police stuff.\"Though he was disappointed, Joseph Clayton knew that something like this couldnt be delayed. \"Alright, maybe Ill see you tomorrow. Goodnight.\" After getting an answer back in the form of a goodnight kiss (which still made him blush despite himself), he watched Marie depart toward her parents vehicle. The question came back to him, after all these weeks, of who in this town could be angry or stupid enough to be implicated in the vandalism spree that had plagued the Leng Trinh restaurant.At Roughly the Same time, Glaston Police StationAs Constance Blake entered the interview room, she reflected on the fact that it had to have been a pretty slow couple of weeks when they pulled the Chief of Police out of her office for a break in a vandalism case. On the other hand, shed finished the normal paperwork an hour before and had been flipping through a fishing catalog with the squawk-box on beside her when Lt. Anderson had come in. Hed told her that theyd arrested some punk kid trying to bust up the Trinhs restaurant, the culmination in a series of events that had been the height of municipal intrigue for weeks. As she got a look at the culprit, she was a little surprised.\"Punk kid\" indeed.As she sat down across from suspect, Chief Blake tapped the case file, a few reports inside a paper folder, against the table. \"You know,\" she began dryly, \"we get quite a few idiots through here: gang members, druggies, people whove taken offense one to many times. We just havent ever got one who was this high up in the High School Math Club.\" She dropped the file in front of Than Quang Due, a young man who, besides having a Sino-typical naming structure, was short, thin, bespectacled and looked amazingly like a 12-year old for someone who was actually 15. He and his parents had moved here the the summer and had set up a jewelery shop a few blocks over from Leng Trinh. Up until this, Due had never been anything but a model student, a respectful son and a bright (if somewhat timid) young man. \"So, whyd you do it?\"Due looked at the middle aged woman with a gaze that mixed deference with surprise in the face of seeming insanity. \"Because no one else would! Because this town has tolerated... people like that for so long.\". There was a touch of bitterness in his voice but also surprise. Were these people so stupid that they didnt recognize a threat in their very midst?\"Look, I dont know whats going on, but I know that it stops right now.\" Constance stood up and, even at 51\", the sight of her leaning over the suspect should have been intimidating to the boy. But then Blake began asking almost rhetorical questions \"What is this about anyway? You ask out their daughter and get refused? Well, if that is it, this was between you, her and the Clayton boy. No need to get mad at her parents.\" It was then that another idea came to the Chief of Police. \"Or is this because theyre Hmong?\"At this, Dues face carried a look of utter incomprehension.\"Look, I realize that theres some bad blood carried over from the War. But you have to realize something too: this is America, the land of opportunity, of freedom. This is the land where people should be able to get away from the madness, where every little feud and squabble is best left back in the old country. Now, your parents and the Trinhs are going to be here soon and if youre smart, you will apologize; Thuc Van and Thanh Thi are good people, theyre liked in the community and as sure as God made little green apples, they didnt deserve any of this.\"It was then that realization dawned on Due. The people who had informed him and sent him on this mission had mandated secrecy... but apparently he and they werent the only ones good at keeping secrets.With a look that held a touch of arrogance, a smidgen of fascinated bewilderment and, especially in his grin, the hint that he was not totally mentally hinged, Due asked a question that infuriated Constance Blake. \"You have no idea what they are, do you?\""]}
{"id": "EN052", "pair": ["II. An Antecedent and a Horror1.Joseph Curwen, as revealed by the rambling legends embodied in what Ward heard and unearthed, was a very astonishing, enigmatic, and obscurely horrible individual. He had fled from Salem to Providence - that universal haven of the odd, the free, and the dissenting - at the beginning of the great witchcraft panic; being in fear of accusation because of his solitary ways and queer chemical or alchemical experiments. He was a colourless-looking man of about thirty, and was soon found qualified to become a freeman of Providence; thereafter buying a home lot just north of Gregory Dexters at about the foot of Olney Street. His house was built on Stampers Hill west of the Town Street, in what later became Olney Court; and in 1761 he replaced this with a larger one, on the same site, which is still standing.      Now the first odd thing about Joseph Curwen was that he did not seem to grow much older than he had been on his arrival. He engaged in shipping enterprises, purchased wharfage near Mile-End Cove, helped rebuild the Great Bridge in 1713, and in 1723 was one of the founders of the Congregational Church on the hill; but always did he retain the nondescript aspect of a man not greatly over thirty or thirty-five. As decades mounted up, this singular quality began to excite wide notice; but Curwen always explained it by saying that he came of hardy forefathers, and practiced a simplicity of living which did not wear him out. How such simplicity could be reconciled with the inexplicable comings and goings of the secretive merchant, and with the queer gleaming of his windows at all hours of night, was not very clear to the townsfolk; and they were prone to assign other reasons for his continued youth and longevity. It was held, for the most part, that Curwens incessant mixings and boilings of chemicals had much to do with his condition. Gossip spoke of the strange substances he brought from London and the Indies on his ships or purchased in Newport, Boston, and New York; and when old Dr. Jabez Bowen came from Rehoboth and opened his apothecary shop across the Great Bridge at the Sign of the Unicorn and Mortar, there was ceaseless talk of the drugs, acids, and metals that the taciturn recluse incessantly bought or ordered from him. Acting on the assumption that Curwen possessed a wondrous and secret medical skill, many sufferers of various sorts applied to him for aid; but though he appeared to encourage their belief in a non-committal way, and always gave them odd-coloured potions in response to their requests, it was observed that his ministrations to others seldom proved of benefit. At length, when over fifty years had passed since the strangers advent, and without producing more than five years apparent change in his face and physique, the people began to whisper more darkly; and to meet more than half way that desire for isolation which he had always shewn.      Private letters and diaries of the period reveal, too, a multitude of other reasons why Joseph Curwen was marvelled at, feared, and finally shunned like a plague. His passion for graveyards, in which he was glimpsed at all hours and under all conditions, was notorious; though no one had witnessed any deed on his part which could actually be termed ghoulish. On the Pawtuxet Road he had a farm, at which he generally lived during the summer, and to which he would frequently be seen riding at various odd times of the day or night. Here his only visible servants, farmers, and caretakers were a sullen pair of aged Narragansett Indians; the husband dumb and curiously scarred, and the wife of a very repulsive cast of countenance, probably due to a mixture of negro blood. In the lean-to of this house was the laboratory where most of the chemical experiments were conducted. Curious porters and teamers who delivered bottles, bags, or boxes at the small rear door would exchange accounts of the fantastic flasks, crucibles, alembics, and furnaces they saw in the low shelved room; and prophesied in whispers that the close-mouthed \"chymist\" - by which they meant alchemist - would not be long in finding the Philosophers Stone. The nearest neighbours to this farm - the Fenners, a quarter of a mile away - had still queerer things to tell of certain sounds which they insisted came from the Curwen place in the night. There were cries, they said, and sustained howlings; and they did not like the large number of livestock which thronged the pastures, for no such amount was needed to keep a lone old man and a very few servants in meat, milk, and wool. The identity of the stock seemed to change from week to week as new droves were purchased from the Kingstown farmers. Then, too, there was something very obnoxious about a certain great stone outbuilding with only high narrow slits for windows.      Great Bridge idlers likewise had much to say of Curwens town house in Olney Court; not so much the fine new one built in 1761, when the man must have been nearly a century old, but the first low gambrel-roofed one with the windowless attic and shingled sides, whose timbers he took the peculiar precaution of burning after its demolition. Here there was less mystery, it is true; but the hours at which lights were seen, the secretiveness of the two swarthy foreigners who comprised the only menservants, the hideous indistinct mumbling of the incredibly aged French housekeeper, the large amounts of food seen to enter a door within which only four persons lived, and the quality of certain voices often heard in muffled conversation at highly unseasonable times, all combined with what was known of the Pawtuxet farm to give the place a bad name.      In choicer circles, too, the Curwen home was by no means undiscussed; for as the newcomer had gradually worked into the church and trading life of the town, he had naturally made acquaintances of the better sort, whose company and conversation he was well fitted by education to enjoy. His birth was known to be good, since the Curwens or Corwins of Salem needed no introduction in New England. It developed that Joseph Curwen had travelled much in very early life, living for a time in England and making at least two voyages to the Orient; and his speech, when he deigned to use it, was that of a learned and cultivated Englishman. But for some reason or other Curwen did not care for society. Whilst never actually rebuffing a visitor, he always reared such a wall of reserve that few could think of anything to say to him which would not sound inane.      There seemed to lurk in his bearing some cryptic, sardonic arrogance, as if he had come to find all human beings dull through having moved among stranger and more potent entities. When Dr. Checkley the famous wit came from Boston in 1738 to be rector of Kings Church, he did not neglect calling on one of whom he soon heard so much; but left in a very short while because of some sinister undercurrent he detected in his hosts discourse. Charles Ward told his father, when they discussed Curwen one winter evening, that he would give much to learn what the mysterious old man had said to the sprightly cleric, but that all diarists agree concerning Dr. Checkleys reluctance to repeat anything he had heard. The good man had been hideously shocked, and could never recall Joseph Curwen without a visible loss of the gay urbanity for which he was famed.      More definite, however, was the reason why another man of taste and breeding avoided the haughty hermit. In 1746 Mr. John Merritt, an elderly English gentleman of literary and scientific leanings, came from Newport to the town which was so rapidly overtaking it in standing, and built a fine country seat on the Neck in what is now the heart of the best residence section. He lived in considerable style and comfort, keeping the first coach and liveried servants in town, and taking great pride in his telescope, his microscope, and his well-chosen library of English and Latin books. Hearing of Curwen as the owner of the best library in Providence, Mr. Merritt early paid him a call, and was more cordially received than most other callers at the house had been. His admiration for his hosts ample shelves, which besides the Greek, Latin, and English classics were equipped with a remarkable battery of philosophical, mathematical, and scientific works including Paracelsus, Agricola, Van Helmont, Sylvius, Glauber, Boyle, Boerhaave, Becher, and Stahl, led Curwen to suggest a visit to the farmhouse and laboratory whither he had never invited anyone before; and the two drove out at once in Mr. Merritts coach.      Mr. Merritt always confessed to seeing nothing really horrible at the farmhouse, but maintained that the titles of the books in the special library of thaumaturgical, alchemical, and theological subjects which Curwen kept in a front room were alone sufficient to inspire him with a lasting loathing. Perhaps, however, the facial expression of the owner in exhibiting them contributed much of the prejudice. The bizarre collection, besides a host of standard works which Mr. Merritt was not too alarmed to envy, embraced nearly all the cabbalists, daemonologists, and magicians known to man; and was a treasure-house of lore in the doubtful realms of alchemy and astrology. Hermes Trismegistus in Mesnards edition, the Turba Philosophorum, Gebers Liber Investigationis, and Artephius Key of Wisdom all were there; with the cabbalistic Zohar, Peter Jammys set of Albertus Magnus, Raymond Lullys Ars Magna et Ultima in Zetzners edition, Roger Bacons Thesaurus Chemicus, Fludds Clavis Alchimiae, and Trithemius De Lapide Philosophico crowding them close. Mediaeval Jews and Arabs were represented in profusion, and Mr. Merritt turned pale when, upon taking down a fine volume conspicuously labelled as the Qanoon-e-Islam, he found it was in truth the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred, of which he had heard such monstrous things whispered some years previously after the exposure of nameless rites at the strange little fishing village of Kingsport, in the Province of the Massachusetts-Bay.      But oddly enough, the worthy gentleman owned himself most impalpably disquieted by a mere minor detail. On the huge mahogany table there lay face downward a badly worn copy of Borellus, bearing many cryptical marginalia and interlineations in Curwens hand. The book was open at about its middle, and one paragraph displayed such thick and tremulous pen-strokes beneath the lines of mystic black-letter that the visitor could not resist scanning it through. Whether it was the nature of the passage underscored, or the feverish heaviness of the strokes which formed the underscoring, he could not tell; but something in that combination affected him very badly and very peculiarly. He recalled it to the end of his days, writing it down from memory in his diary and once trying to recite it to his close friend Dr. Checkley till he saw how greatly it disturbed the urbane rector. It read:      \"The essential Saltes of Animals may be so prepared and preserved, that an ingenious Man may have the whole Ark of Noah in his own Studie, and raise the fine Shape of an Animal out of its Ashes at his Pleasure; and by the lyke Method from the essential Saltes of humane Dust, a Philosopher may, without any criminal Necromancy, call up the Shape of any dead Ancestour from the Dust whereinto his Bodie has been incinerated.\"      It was near the docks along the southerly part of the Town Street, however, that the worst things were muttered about Joseph Curwen. Sailors are superstitious folk; and the seasoned salts who manned the infinite rum, slave, and molasses sloops, the rakish privateers, and the great brigs of the Browns, Crawfords, and Tillinghasts, all made strange furtive signs of protection when they saw the slim, deceptively young-looking figure with its yellow hair and slight stoop entering the Curwen warehouse in Doubloon Street or talking with captains and supercargoes on the long quay where the Curwen ships rode restlessly. Curwens own clerks and captains hated and feared him, and all his sailors were mongrel riff-raff from Martinique, St. Eustatius, Havana, or Port Royal. It was, in a way, the frequency with which these sailors were replaced which inspired the acutest and most tangible part of the fear in which the old man was held. A crew would be turned loose in the town on shore leave, some of its members perhaps charged with this errand or that; and when reassembled it would be almost sure to lack one or more men. That many of the errands had concerned the farm on the Pawtuxet Road, and that few of the sailors had ever been seen to return from that place, was not forgotten; so that in time it became exceedingly difficult for Curwen to keep his oddly assorted hands. Almost invariably several would desert soon after hearing the gossip of the Providence wharves, and their replacement in the West Indies became an increasingly great problem to the merchant.      In 1760 Joseph Curwen was virtually an outcast, suspected of vague horrors and daemoniac alliances which seemed all the more menacing because they could not be named, understood, or even proved to exist. The last straw may have come from the affair of the missing soldiers in 1758, for in March and April of that year two Royal regiments on their way to New France were quartered in Providence, and depleted by an inexplicable process far beyond the average rate of desertion. Rumour dwelt on the frequency with which Curwen was wont to be seen talking with the red-coated strangers; and as several of them began to be missed, people thought of the odd conditions among his own seamen. What would have happened if the regiments had not been ordered on, no one can tell.      Meanwhile the merchants worldly affairs were prospering. He had a virtual monopoly of the towns trade in saltpetre, black pepper, and cinnamon, and easily led any other one shipping establishment save the Browns in his importation of brassware, indigo, cotton, woollens, salt, rigging, iron, paper, and English goods of every kind. Such shopkeepers as James Green, at the Sign of the Elephant in Cheapside, the Russells, at the Sign of the Golden Eagle across the Bridge, or Clark and Nightingale at the Frying-Pan and Fish near the New Coffee-House, depended almost wholly upon him for their stock; and his arrangements with the local distillers, the Narragansett dairymen and horse-breeders, and the Newport candle-makers, made him one of the prime exporters of the Colony.      Ostracised though he was, he did not lack for civic spirit of a sort. When the Colony House burned down, he subscribed handsomely to the lotteries by which the new brick one - still standing at the head of its parade in the old main street - was built in 1761. In that same year, too, he helped rebuild the Great Bridge after the October gale. He replaced many of the books of the public library consumed in the Colony House fire, and bought heavily in the lottery that gave the muddy Market Parade and deep-rutted Town Street their pavement of great round stones with a brick footwalk or \"causey\" in the middle. About this time, also, he built the plain but excellent new house whose doorway is still such a triumph of carving. When the Whitefield adherents broke off from Dr. Cottons hill church in 1743 and founded Deacon Snows church across the Bridge, Curwen had gone with them; though his zeal and attendance soon abated. Now, however, he cultivated piety once more; as if to dispel the shadow which had thrown him into isolation and would soon begin to wreck his business fortunes if not sharply checked.2.      The sight of this strange, pallid man, hardly middle-aged in aspect yet certainly not less than a full century old, seeking at last to emerge from a cloud of fright and detestation too vague to pin down or analyse, was at once a pathetic, a dramatic, and a contemptible thing. Such is the power of wealth and of surface gestures, however, that there came indeed a slight abatement in the visible aversion displayed toward him; especially after the rapid disappearances of his sailors abruptly ceased. He must likewise have begun to practice an extreme care and secrecy in his graveyard expeditions, for he was never again caught at such wanderings; whilst the rumours of uncanny sounds and manoeuvres at his Pawtuxet farm diminished in proportion. His rate of food consumption and cattle replacement remained abnormally high; but not until modern times, when Charles Ward examined a set of his accounts and invoices in the Shepley Library, did it occur to any person - save one embittered youth, perhaps - to make dark comparisons between the large number of Guinea blacks he imported until 1766, and the disturbingly small number for whom he could produce bona fide bills of sale either to slave-dealers at the Great Bridge or to the planters of the Narragansett Country. Certainly, the cunning and ingenuity of this abhorred character were uncannily profound, once the necessity for their exercise had become impressed upon him.      But of course the effect of all this belated mending was necessarily slight. Curwen continued to be avoided and distrusted, as indeed the one fact of his continued air of youth at a great age would have been enough to warrant; and he could see that in the end his fortunes would be likely to suffer. His elaborate studies and experiments, whatever they may have been, apparently required a heavy income for their maintenance; and since a change of environment would deprive him of the trading advantages he had gained, it would not have profited him to begin anew in a different region just then. Judgment demanded that he patch up his relations with the townsfolk of Providence, so that his presence might no longer be a signal for hushed conversation, transparent excuses of errands elsewhere, and a general atmosphere of constraint and uneasiness. His clerks, being now reduced to the shiftless and impecunious residue whom no one else would employ, were giving him much worry; and he held to his sea-captains and mates only by shrewdness in gaining some kind of ascendancy over them - a mortgage, a promissory note, or a bit of information very pertinent to their welfare. In many cases, diarists have recorded with some awe, Curwen shewed almost the power of a wizard in unearthing family secrets for questionable use. During the final five years of his life it seemed as though only direct talks with the long-dead could possibly have furnished some of the data which he had so glibly at his tongues end.      About this time the crafty scholar hit upon a last desperate expedient to regain his footing in the community. Hitherto a complete hermit, he now determined to contract an advantageous marriage; securing as a bride some lady whose unquestioned position would make all ostracism of his home impossible. It may be that he also had deeper reasons for wishing an alliance; reasons so far outside the known cosmic sphere that only papers found a century and a half after his death caused anyone to suspect them; but of this nothing certain can ever be learned. Naturally he was aware of the horror and indignation with which any ordinary courtship of his would be received, hence he looked about for some likely candidate upon whose parents he might exert a suitable pressure. Such candidates, he found, were not at all easy to discover; since he had very particular requirements in the way of beauty, accomplishments, and social security. At length his survey narrowed down to the household of one of his best and oldest ship-captains, a widower of high birth and unblemished standing named Dutee Tillinghast, whose only daughter Eliza seemed dowered with every conceivable advantage save prospects as an heiress. Capt. Tillinghast was completely under the domination of Curwen; and consented, after a terrible interview in his cupolaed house on Powers Lane hill, to sanction the blasphemous alliance.      Eliza Tillinghast was at that time eighteen years of age, and had been reared as gently as the reduced circumstances of her father permitted. She had attended Stephen Jacksons school opposite the Court-House Parade; and had been diligently instructed by her mother, before the latters death of smallpox in 1757, in all the arts and refinements of domestic life. A sampler of hers, worked in 1753 at the age of nine, may still be found in the rooms of the Rhode Island Historical Society. After her mothers death she had kept the house, aided only by one old black woman. Her arguments with her father concerning the proposed Curwen marriage must have been painful indeed; but of these we have no record. Certain it is that her engagement to young Ezra Weeden, second mate of the Crawford packet Enterprise, was dutifully broken off, and that her union with Joseph Curwen took place on the seventh of March, 1763, in the Baptist church, in the presence of one of the most distinguished assemblages which the town could boast; the ceremony being performed by the younger Samuel Winsor. The Gazette mentioned the event very briefly, and in most surviving copies the item in question seems to be cut or torn out. Ward found a single intact copy after much search in the archives of a private collector of note, observing with amusement the meaningless urbanity of the language:      \"Monday evening last, Mr. Joseph Curwen, of this Town, Merchant, was married to Miss Eliza Tillinghast, Daughter of Capt. Dutee Tillinghast, a young Lady who has real Merit, added to a beautiful Person, to grace the connubial State and perpetuate its Felicity.\"      The collection of Durfee-Arnold letters, discovered by Charles Ward shortly before his first reputed madness in the private collection of Melville F. Peters, Esq., of George St., and covering this and a somewhat antecedent period, throws vivid light on the outrage done to public sentiment by this ill-assorted match. The social influence of the Tillinghasts, however, was not to be denied; and once more Joseph Curwen found his house frequented by persons whom he could never otherwise have induced to cross his threshold. His acceptance was by no means complete, and his bride was socially the sufferer through her forced venture; but at all events the wall of utter ostracism was somewhat worn down. In his treatment of his wife the strange bridegroom astonished both her and the community by displaying an extreme graciousness and consideration. The new house in Olney Court was now wholly free from disturbing manifestations, and although Curwen was much absent at the Pawtuxet farm which his wife never visited, he seemed more like a normal citizen than at any other time in his long years of residence. Only one person remained in open enmity with him, this being the youthful ships officer whose engagement to Eliza Tillinghast had been so abruptly broken. Ezra Weeden had frankly vowed vengeance; and though of a quiet and ordinarily mild disposition, was now gaining a hate-bred, dogged purpose which boded no good to the usurping husband.      On the seventh of May, 1765, Curwens only child Ann was born; and was christened by the Rev. John Graves of Kings Church, of which both husband and wife had become communicants shortly after their marriage, in order to compromise between their respective Congregational and Baptist affiliations. The record of this birth, as well as that of the marriage two years before, was stricken from most copies of the church and town annals where it ought to appear; and Charles Ward located both with the greatest difficulty after his discovery of the widows change of name had apprised him of his own relationship, and engendered the feverish interest which culminated in his madness. The birth entry, indeed, was found very curiously through correspondence with the heirs of the loyalist Dr. Graves, who had taken with him a duplicate set of records when he left his pastorate at the outbreak of the Revolution. Ward had tried this source because he knew that his great-great-grandmother Ann Tillinghast Potter had been an Episcopalian.      Shortly after the birth of his daughter, an event he seemed to welcome with a fervour greatly out of keeping with his usual coldness, Curwen resolved to sit for a portrait. This he had painted by a very gifted Scotsman named Cosmo Alexander, then a resident of Newport, and since famous as the early teacher of Gilbert Stuart. The likeness was said to have been executed on a wall-panel of the library of the house in Olney Court, but neither of the two old diaries mentioning it gave any hint of its ultimate disposition. At this period the erratic scholar shewed signs of unusual abstraction, and spent as much time as he possibly could at his farm on the Pawtuxet Road. He seemed, it was stated, in a condition of suppressed excitement or suspense; as if expecting some phenomenal thing or on the brink of some strange discovery. Chemistry or alchemy would appear to have played a great part, for he took from his house to the farm the greater number of his volumes on that subject.      His affectation of civic interest did not diminish, and he lost no opportunities for helping such leaders as Stephen Hopkins, Joseph Brown, and Benjamin West in their efforts to raise the cultural tone of the town, which was then much below the level of Newport in its patronage of the liberal arts. He had helped Daniel Jenckes found his bookshop in 1763, and was thereafter his best customer; extending aid likewise to the struggling Gazette that appeared each Wednesday at the Sign of Shakespears Head. In politics he ardently supported Governor Hopkins against the Ward party whose prime strength was in Newport, and his really eloquent speech at Hackers Hall in 1765 against the setting off of North Providence as a separate town with a pro-Ward vote in the General Assembly did more than any other one thing to wear down the prejudice against him. But Ezra Weeden, who watched him closely, sneered cynically at all this outward activity; and freely swore it was no more than a mask for some nameless traffick with the blackest gulfs of Tartarus. The revengeful youth began a systematic study of the man and his doings whenever he was in port; spending hours at night by the wharves with a dory in readiness when he saw lights in the Curwen warehouses, and following the small boat which would sometimes steal quietly off and down the bay. He also kept as close a watch as possible on the Pawtuxet farm, and was once severely bitten by the dogs the old Indian couple loosed upon him.3.      In 1766 came the final change in Joseph Curwen. It was very sudden, and gained wide notice amongst the curious townsfolk; for the air of suspense and expectancy dropped like an old cloak, giving instant place to an ill-concealed exaltation of perfect triumph. Curwen seemed to have difficulty in restraining himself from public harangues on what he had found or learned or made; but apparently the need of secrecy was greater than the longing to share his rejoicing, for no explanation was ever offered by him. It was after this transition, which appears to have come early in July, that the sinister scholar began to astonish people by his possession of information which only their long-dead ancestors would seem to be able to impart.      But Curwens feverish secret activities by no means ceased with this change. On the contrary, they tended rather to increase; so that more and more of his shipping business was handled by the captains whom he now bound to him by ties of fear as potent as those of bankruptcy had been. He altogether abandoned the slave trade, alleging that its profits were constantly decreasing. Every possible moment was spent at the Pawtuxet farm; though there were rumours now and then of his presence in places which, though not actually near graveyards, were yet so situated in relation to graveyards that thoughtful people wondered just how thorough the old merchants change of habits really was. Ezra Weeden, though his periods of espionage were necessarily brief and intermittent on account of his sea voyaging, had a vindictive persistence which the bulk of the practical townsfolk and farmers lacked; and subjected Curwens affairs to a scrutiny such as they had never had before.      Many of the odd manoeuvres of the strange merchants vessels had been taken for granted on account of the unrest of the times, when every colonist seemed determined to resist the provisions of the Sugar Act which hampered a prominent traffick. Smuggling and evasion were the rule in Narragansett Bay, and nocturnal landings of illicit cargoes were continuous commonplaces. But Weeden, night after night following the lighters or small sloops which he saw steal off from the Curwen warehouses at the Town Street docks, soon felt assured that it was not merely His Majestys armed ships which the sinister skulker was anxious to avoid. Prior to the change in 1766 these boats had for the most part contained chained negroes, who were carried down and across the bay and landed at an obscure point on the shore just north of Pawtuxet; being afterward driven up the bluff and across country to the Curwen farm, where they were locked in that enormous stone outbuilding which had only high narrow slits for windows. After that change, however, the whole programme was altered. Importation of slaves ceased at once, and for a time Curwen abandoned his midnight sailings. Then, about the spring of 1767, a new policy appeared. Once more the lighters grew wont to put out from the black, silent docks, and this time they would go down the bay some distance, perhaps as far as Namquit Point, where they would meet and receive cargo from strange ships of considerable size and widely varied appearance. Curwens sailors would then deposit this cargo at the usual point on the shore, and transport it overland to the farm; locking it in the same cryptical stone building which had formerly received the negroes. The cargo consisted almost wholly of boxes and cases, of which a large proportion were oblong and heavy and disturbingly suggestive of coffins.      Weeden always watched the farm with unremitting assiduity; visiting it each night for long periods, and seldom letting a week go by without a sight except when the ground bore a footprint-revealing snow. Even then he would often walk as close as possible in the travelled road or on the ice of the neighbouring river to see what tracks others might have left. Finding his own vigils interrupted by nautical duties, he hired a tavern companion named Eleazar Smith to continue the survey during his absences; and between them the two could have set in motion some extraordinary rumours. That they did not do so was only because they knew the effect of publicity would be to warn their quarry and make further progress impossible. Instead, they wished to learn something definite before taking any action. What they did learn must have been startling indeed, and Charles Ward spoke many times to his parents of his regret at Weedens later burning of his notebooks. All that can be told of their discoveries is what Eleazar Smith jotted down in a none too coherent diary, and what other diarists and letter-writers have timidly repeated from the statements which they finally made - and according to which the farm was only the outer shell of some vast and revolting menace, of a scope and depth too profound and intangible for more than shadowy comprehension.      It is gathered that Weeden and Smith became early convinced that a great series of tunnels and catacombs, inhabited by a very sizeable staff of persons besides the old Indian and his wife, underlay the farm. The house was an old peaked relic of the middle seventeenth century with enormous stack chimney and diamond-paned lattice windows, the laboratory being in a lean-to toward the north, where the roof came nearly to the ground. This building stood clear of any other; yet judging by the different voices heard at odd times within, it must have been accessible through secret passages beneath. These voices, before 1766, were mere mumblings and negro whisperings and frenzied screams, coupled with curious chants or invocations. After that date, however, they assumed a very singular and terrible cast as they ran the gamut betwixt dronings of dull acquiescence and explosions of frantic pain or fury, rumblings of conversation and whines of entreaty, pantings of eagerness and shouts of protest. They appeared to be in different languages, all known to Curwen, whose rasping accents were frequently distinguishable in reply, reproof, or threatening. Sometimes it seemed that several persons must be in the house; Curwen, certain captives, and the guards of those captives. There were voices of a sort that neither Weeden nor Smith had ever heard before despite their wide knowledge of foreign parts, and many that they did seem to place as belonging to this or that nationality. The nature of the conversations seemed always a kind of catechism, as if Curwen were extorting some sort of information from terrified or rebellious prisoners.      Weeden had many verbatim reports of overheard scraps in his notebook, for English, French, and Spanish, which he knew, were frequently used; but of these nothing has survived. He did, however, say that besides a few ghoulish dialogues in which the past affairs of Providence families were concerned, most of the questions and answers he could understand were historical or scientific; occasionally pertaining to very remote places and ages. Once, for example, an alternately raging and sullen figure was questioned in French about the Black Princes massacre at Limoges in 1370, as if there were some hidden reason which he ought to know. Curwen asked the prisoner - if prisoner it were - whether the order to slay was given because of the Sign of the Goat found on the altar in the ancient Roman crypt beneath the Cathedral, or whether the Dark Man of the Haute Vienne Coven had spoken the Three Words. Failing to obtain replies, the inquisitor had seemingly resorted to extreme means; for there was a terrific shriek followed by silence and muttering and a bumping sound.      None of these colloquies were ever ocularly witnessed, since the windows were always heavily draped. Once, though, during a discourse in an unknown tongue, a shadow was seen on the curtain which startled Weeden exceedingly; reminding him of one of the puppets in a show he had seen in the autumn of 1764 in Hackers Hall, when a man from Germantown, Pennsylvania, had given a clever mechanical spectacle advertised as a \"View of the Famous City of Jerusalem, in which are represented Jerusalem, the Temple of Solomon, his Royal Throne, the noted Towers, and Hills, likewise the Sufferings of Our Saviour from the Garden of Gethsemane to the Cross on the Hill of Golgotha; an artful piece of Statuary, Worthy to be seen by the Curious.\" It was on this occasion that the listener, who had crept close to the window of the front room whence the speaking proceeded, gave a start which roused the old Indian pair and caused them to loose the dogs on him. After that no more conversations were ever heard in the house, and Weeden and Smith concluded that Curwen had transferred his field of action to regions below.      That such regions in truth existed, seemed amply clear from many things. Faint cries and groans unmistakably came up now and then from what appeared to be the solid earth in places far from any structure; whilst hidden in the bushes along the river-bank in the rear, where the high ground sloped steeply down to the valley of the Pawtuxet, there was found an arched oaken door in a frame of heavy masonry, which was obviously an entrance to caverns within the hill. When or how these catacombs could have been constructed, Weeden was unable to say; but he frequently pointed out how easily the place might have been reached by bands of unseen workmen from the river. Joseph Curwen put his mongrel seamen to diverse uses indeed! During the heavy spring rains of 1769 the two watchers kept a sharp eye on the steep river-bank to see if any subterrene secrets might be washed to light, and were rewarded by the sight of a profusion of both human and animal bones in places where deep gullies had been worn in the banks. Naturally there might be many explanations of such things in the rear of a stock farm, and in a locality where old Indian burying-grounds were common, but Weeden and Smith drew their own inferences.      It was in January 1770, whilst Weeden and Smith were still debating vainly on what, if anything, to think or do about the whole bewildering business, that the incident of the Fortaleza occurred. Exasperated by the burning of the revenue sloop Liberty at Newport during the previous summer, the customs fleet under Admiral Wallace had adopted an increased vigilance concerning strange vessels; and on this occasion His Majestys armed schooner Cygnet, under Capt. Charles Leslie, captured after a short pursuit one early morning the snow Fortaleza of Barcelona, Spain, under Capt. Manuel Arruda, bound according to its log from Grand Cairo, Egypt, to Providence. When searched for contraband material, this ship revealed the astonishing fact that its cargo consisted exclusively of Egyptian mummies, consigned to \"Sailor A. B. C.\", who would come to remove his goods in a lighter just off Namquit Point and whose identity Capt. Arruda felt himself in honour bound not to reveal. The Vice-Admiralty Court at Newport, at a loss what to do in view of the non-contraband nature of the cargo on the one hand and of the unlawful secrecy of the entry on the other hand, compromised on Collector Robinsons recommendation by freeing the ship but forbidding it a port in Rhode Island waters. There were later rumours of its having been seen in Boston Harbour, though it never openly entered the Port of Boston.      This extraordinary incident did not fail of wide remark in Providence, and there were not many who doubted the existence of some connexion between the cargo of mummies and the sinister Joseph Curwen. His exotic studies and his curious chemical importations being common knowledge, and his fondness for graveyards being common suspicion; it did not take much imagination to link him with a freakish importation which could not conceivably have been destined for anyone else in the town. As if conscious of this natural belief, Curwen took care to speak casually on several occasions of the chemical value of the balsams found in mummies; thinking perhaps that he might make the affair seem less unnatural, yet stopping just short of admitting his participation. Weeden and Smith, of course, felt no doubt whatsoever of the significance of the thing; and indulged in the wildest theories concerning Curwen and his monstrous labours.      The following spring, like that of the year before, had heavy rains; and the watchers kept careful track of the river-bank behind the Curwen farm. Large sections were washed away, and a certain number of bones discovered; but no glimpse was afforded of any actual subterranean chambers or burrows. Something was rumoured, however, at the village of Pawtuxet about a mile below, where the river flows in falls over a rocky terrace to join the placid landlocked cove. There, where quaint old cottages climbed the hill from the rustic bridge, and fishing-smacks lay anchored at their sleepy docks, a vague report went round of things that were floating down the river and flashing into sight for a minute as they went over the falls. Of course the Pawtuxet is a long river which winds through many settled regions abounding in graveyards, and of course the spring rains had been very heavy; but the fisherfolk about the bridge did not like the wild way that one of the things stared as it shot down to the still water below, or the way that another half cried out although its condition had greatly departed from that of objects which normally cry out. That rumour sent Smith - for Weeden was just then at sea - in haste to the river-bank behind the farm; where surely enough there remained the evidences of an extensive cave-in. There was, however, no trace of a passage into the steep bank; for the miniature avalanche had left behind a solid wall of mixed earth and shrubbery from aloft. Smith went to the extent of some experimental digging, but was deterred by lack of success - or perhaps by fear of possible success. It is interesting to speculate on what the persistent and revengeful Weeden would have done had he been ashore at the time.4.      By the autumn of 1770 Weeden decided that the time was ripe to tell others of his discoveries; for he had a large number of facts to link together, and a second eye-witness to refute the possible charge that jealousy and vindictiveness had spurred his fancy. As his first confidant he selected Capt. James Mathewson of the Enterprise, who on the one hand knew him well enough not to doubt his veracity, and on the other hand was sufficiently influential in the town to be heard in turn with respect. The colloquy took place in an upper room of Sabins Tavern near the docks, with Smith present to corroborate virtually every statement; and it could be seen that Capt. Mathewson was tremendously impressed. Like nearly everyone else in the town, he had had black suspicions of his own anent Joseph Curwen; hence it needed only this confirmation and enlargement of data to convince him absolutely. At the end of the conference he was very grave, and enjoined strict silence upon the two younger men. He would, he said, transmit the information separately to some ten or so of the most learned and prominent citizens of Providence; ascertaining their views and following whatever advice they might have to offer. Secrecy would probably be essential in any case, for this was no matter that the town constables or militia could cope with; and above all else the excitable crowd must be kept in ignorance, lest there be enacted in these already troublous times a repetition of that frightful Salem panic of less than a century before which had first brought Curwen hither.      The right persons to tell, he believed, would be Dr. Benjamin West, whose pamphlet on the late transit of Venus proved him a scholar and keen thinker; Rev. James Manning, President of the College which had just moved up from Warren and was temporarily housed in the new King Street schoolhouse awaiting the completion of its building on the hill above Presbyterian-Lane; ex-Governor Stephen Hopkins, who had been a member of the Philosophical Society at Newport, and was a man of very broad perceptions; John Carter, publisher of the Gazette; all four of the Brown brothers, John, Joseph, Nicholas, and Moses, who formed the recognised local magnates, and of whom Joseph was an amateur scientist of parts; old Dr. Jabez Bowen, whose erudition was considerable, and who had much first-hand knowledge of Curwens odd purchases; and Capt. Abraham Whipple, a privateersman of phenomenal boldness and energy who could be counted on to lead in any active measures needed. These men, if favourable, might eventually be brought together for collective deliberation; and with them would rest the responsibility of deciding whether or not to inform the Governor of the Colony, Joseph Wanton of Newport, before taking action.      The mission of Capt. Mathewson prospered beyond his highest expectations; for whilst he found one or two of the chosen confidants somewhat sceptical of the possible ghastly side of Weedens tale, there was not one who did not think it necessary to take some sort of secret and cordinated action. Curwen, it was clear, formed a vague potential menace to the welfare of the town and Colony; and must be eliminated at any cost. Late in December 1770 a group of eminent townsmen met at the home of Stephen Hopkins and debated tentative measures. Weedens notes, which he had given to Capt. Mathewson, were carefully read; and he and Smith were summoned to give testimony anent details. Something very like fear seized the whole assemblage before the meeting was over, though there ran through that fear a grim determination which Capt. Whipples bluff and resonant profanity best expressed. They would not notify the Governor, because a more than legal course seemed necessary. With hidden powers of uncertain extent apparently at his disposal, Curwen was not a man who could safely be warned to leave town. Nameless reprisals might ensue, and even if the sinister creature complied, the removal would be no more than the shifting of an unclean burden to another place. The times were lawless, and men who had flouted the Kings revenue forces for years were not the ones to balk at sterner things when duty impelled. Curwen must be surprised at his Pawtuxet farm by a large raiding-party of seasoned privateersmen and given one decisive chance to explain himself. If he proved a madman, amusing himself with shrieks and imaginary conversations in different voices, he would be properly confined. If something graver appeared, and if the underground horrors indeed turned out to be real, he and all with him must die. It could be done quietly, and even the widow and her father need not be told how it came about.      While these serious steps were under discussion there occurred in the town an incident so terrible and inexplicable that for a time little else was mentioned for miles around. In the middle of a moonlight January night with heavy snow underfoot there resounded over the river and up the hill a shocking series of cries which brought sleepy heads to every window; and people around Weybosset Point saw a great white thing plunging frantically along the badly cleared space in front of the Turks Head. There was a baying of dogs in the distance, but this subsided as soon as the clamour of the awakened town became audible. Parties of men with lanterns and muskets hurried out to see what was happening, but nothing rewarded their search. The next morning, however, a giant, muscular body, stark naked, was found on the jams of ice around the southern piers of the Great Bridge, where the Long Dock stretched out beside Abbotts distil-house, and the identity of this object became a theme for endless speculation and whispering. It was not so much the younger as the older folk who whispered, for only in the patriarchs did that rigid face with horror-bulging eyes strike any chord of memory. They, shaking as they did so, exchanged furtive murmurs of wonder and fear; for in those stiff, hideous features lay a resemblance so marvellous as to be almost an identity - and that identity was with a man who had died full fifty years before.      Ezra Weeden was present at the finding; and remembering the baying of the night before, set out along Weybosset Street and across Muddy Dock Bridge whence the sound had come. He had a curious expectancy, and was not surprised when, reaching the edge of the settled district where the street merged into the Pawtuxet Road, he came upon some very curious tracks in the snow. The naked giant had been pursued by dogs and many booted men, and the returning tracks of the hounds and their masters could be easily traced. They had given up the chase upon coming too near the town. Weeden smiled grimly, and as a perfunctory detail traced the footprints back to their source. It was the Pawtuxet farm of Joseph Curwen, as he well knew it would be; and he would have given much had the yard been less confusingly trampled. As it was, he dared not seem too interested in full daylight. Dr. Bowen, to whom Weeden went at once with his report, performed an autopsy on the strange corpse, and discovered peculiarities which baffled him utterly. The digestive tracts of the huge man seemed never to have been in use, whilst the whole skin had a coarse, loosely knit texture impossible to account for. Impressed by what the old men whispered of this bodys likeness to the long-dead blacksmith Daniel Green, whose great-grandson Aaron Hoppin was a supercargo in Curwens employ, Weeden asked casual questions till he found where Green was buried. That night a party of ten visited the old North Burying Ground opposite Herrendens Lane and opened a grave. They found it vacant, precisely as they had expected.      Meanwhile arrangements had been made with the post riders to intercept Joseph Curwens mail, and shortly before the incident of the naked body there was found a letter from one Jedediah Orne of Salem which made the coperating citizens think deeply. Parts of it, copied and preserved in the private archives of the Smith family where Charles Ward found it, ran as follows:      \"I delight that you continue in ye Gettg at Olde Matters in your Way, and doe not think better was done at Mr. Hutchinsons in Salem-Village. Certainely, there was Nothg butt ye liveliest Awfulness in that which H. raisd upp from What he coud gather onlie a part of. What you sente, did not Worke, whether because of Any Thing missg, or because ye Wordes were not Righte from my Speakg or yr Copyg. I alone am at a Loss. I have not ye Chymicall art to followe Borellus, and owne my Self confounded by ye VII. Booke of ye Necronomicon that you recommende. But I woud have you Observe what was tolde to us aboute takg Care whom to calle up, for you are Sensible what Mr. Mather writ in ye Magnalia of  -  - , and can judge how truely that Horrendous thing is reported. I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe; by the Which I meane, Any that can in Turne call up somewhat against you, whereby your Powerfullest Devices may not be of use. Ask of the Lesser, lest the Greater shall not wish to Answer, and shall commande more than you. I was frighted when I read of your knowg what Ben Zariatnatmik hadde in his ebony Boxe, for I was conscious who must have tolde you. And againe I ask that you shalle write me as Jedediah and not Simon. In this Community a Man may not live too long, and you knowe my Plan by which I came back as my Son. I am desirous you will Acquaint me with what ye Blacke Man learnt from Sylvanus Cocidius in ye Vault, under ye Roman Wall, and will be obligd for ye Lendg of ye MS. you speak of.\"      Another and unsigned letter from Philadelphia provoked equal thought, especially for the following passage:      \"I will observe what you say respecting the sending of Accounts only by yr Vessels, but can not always be certain when to expect them. In the Matter spoke of, I require onlie one more thing; but wish to be sure I apprehend you exactly. You inform me, that no Part must be missing if the finest Effects are to be had, but you can not but know how hard it is to be sure. It seems a great Hazard and Burthen to take away the whole Box, and in Town (i.e. St. Peters, St. Pauls, St. Marys, or Christ Church) it can scarce be done at all. But I know what Imperfections were in the one I raisd up October last, and how many live Specimens you were forcd to imploy before you hit upon the right Mode in the year 1766; so will be guided by you in all Matters. I am impatient for yr Brig, and inquire daily at Mr. Biddles Wharf.\"      A third suspicious letter was in an unknown tongue and even an unknown alphabet. In the Smith diary found by Charles Ward a single oft-repeated combination of characters is clumsily copied; and authorities at Brown University have pronounced the alphabet Amharic or Abyssinian, although they do not recognise the word. None of these epistles was ever delivered to Curwen, though the disappearance of Jedediah Orne from Salem as recorded shortly afterward shewed that the Providence men took certain quiet steps. The Pennsylvania Historical Society also has some curious letters received by Dr. Shippen regarding the presence of an unwholesome character in Philadelphia. But more decisive steps were in the air, and it is in the secret assemblages of sworn and tested sailors and faithful old privateersmen in the Brown warehouses by night that we must look for the main fruits of Weedens disclosures. Slowly and surely a plan of campaign was under development which would leave no trace of Joseph Curwens noxious mysteries.      Curwen, despite all precautions, apparently felt that something was in the wind; for he was now remarked to wear an unusually worried look. His coach was seen at all hours in the town and on the Pawtuxet Road, and he dropped little by little the air of forced geniality with which he had latterly sought to combat the towns prejudice. The nearest neighbours to his farm, the Fenners, one night remarked a great shaft of light shooting into the sky from some aperture in the roof of that cryptical stone building with the high, excessively narrow windows; an event which they quickly communicated to John Brown in Providence. Mr. Brown had become the executive leader of the select group bent on Curwens extirpation, and had informed the Fenners that some action was about to be taken. This he deemed needful because of the impossibility of their not witnessing the final raid; and he explained his course by saying that Curwen was known to be a spy of the customs officers at Newport, against whom the hand of every Providence shipper, merchant, and farmer was openly or clandestinely raised. Whether the ruse was wholly believed by neighbours who had seen so many queer things is not certain; but at any rate the Fenners were willing to connect any evil with a man of such queer ways. To them Mr. Brown had entrusted the duty of watching the Curwen farmhouse, and of regularly reporting every incident which took place there.5.      The probability that Curwen was on guard and attempting unusual things, as suggested by the odd shaft of light, precipitated at last the action so carefully devised by the band of serious citizens. According to the Smith diary a company of about 100 men met at 10 p.m. on Friday, April 12th, 1771, in the great room of Thurstons Tavern at the Sign of the Golden Lion on Weybosset Point across the Bridge. Of the guiding group of prominent men in addition to the leader John Brown there were present Dr. Bowen, with his case of surgical instruments, President Manning without the great periwig (the largest in the Colonies) for which he was noted, Governor Hopkins, wrapped in his dark cloak and accompanied by his seafaring brother Esek, whom he had initiated at the last moment with the permission of the rest, John Carter, Capt. Mathewson, and Capt. Whipple, who was to lead the actual raiding party. These chiefs conferred apart in a rear chamber, after which Capt. Whipple emerged to the great room and gave the gathered seamen their last oaths and instructions. Eleazar Smith was with the leaders as they sat in the rear apartment awaiting the arrival of Ezra Weeden, whose duty was to keep track of Curwen and report the departure of his coach for the farm.      About 10:30 a heavy rumble was heard on the Great Bridge, followed by the sound of a coach in the street outside; and at that hour there was no need of waiting for Weeden in order to know that the doomed man had set out for his last night of unhallowed wizardry. A moment later, as the receding coach clattered faintly over the Muddy Dock Bridge, Weeden appeared; and the raiders fell silently into military order in the street, shouldering the firelocks, fowling-pieces, or whaling harpoons which they had with them. Weeden and Smith were with the party, and of the deliberating citizens there were present for active service Capt. Whipple, the leader, Capt. Esek Hopkins, John Carter, President Manning, Capt. Mathewson, and Dr. Bowen; together with Moses Brown, who had come up at the eleventh hour though absent from the preliminary session in the tavern. All these freemen and their hundred sailors began the long march without delay, grim and a trifle apprehensive as they left the Muddy Dock behind and mounted the gentle rise of Broad Street toward the Pawtuxet Road. Just beyond Elder Snows church some of the men turned back to take a parting look at Providence lying outspread under the early spring stars. Steeples and gables rose dark and shapely, and salt breezes swept up gently from the cove north of the Bridge. Vega was climbing above the great hill across the water, whose crest of trees was broken by the roof-line of the unfinished College edifice. At the foot of that hill, and along the narrow mounting lanes of its side, the old town dreamed; Old Providence, for whose safety and sanity so monstrous and colossal a blasphemy was about to be wiped out.      An hour and a quarter later the raiders arrived, as previously agreed, at the Fenner farmhouse; where they heard a final report on their intended victim. He had reached his farm over half an hour before, and the strange light had soon afterward shot once into the sky, but there were no lights in any visible windows. This was always the case of late. Even as this news was given another great glare arose toward the south, and the party realised that they had indeed come close to the scene of awesome and unnatural wonders. Capt. Whipple now ordered his force to separate into three divisions; one of twenty men under Eleazar Smith to strike across to the shore and guard the landing-place against possible reinforcements for Curwen until summoned by a messenger for desperate service, a second of twenty men under Capt. Esek Hopkins to steal down into the river valley behind the Curwen farm and demolish with axes or gunpowder the oaken door in the high, steep bank, and the third to close in on the house and adjacent buildings themselves. Of this division one third was to be led by Capt. Mathewson to the cryptical stone edifice with high narrow windows, another third to follow Capt. Whipple himself to the main farmhouse, and the remaining third to preserve a circle around the whole group of buildings until summoned by a final emergency signal.      The river party would break down the hillside door at the sound of a single whistle-blast, then waiting and capturing anything which might issue from the regions within. At the sound of two whistle-blasts it would advance through the aperture to oppose the enemy or join the rest of the raiding contingent. The party at the stone building would accept these respective signals in an analogous manner; forcing an entrance at the first, and at the second descending whatever passage into the ground might be discovered, and joining the general or focal warfare expected to take place within the caverns. A third or emergency signal of three blasts would summon the immediate reserve from its general guard duty; its twenty men dividing equally and entering the unknown depths through both farmhouse and stone building. Capt. Whipples belief in the existence of catacombs was absolute, and he took no alternative into consideration when making his plans. He had with him a whistle of great power and shrillness, and did not fear any upsetting or misunderstanding of signals. The final reserve at the landing, of course, was nearly out of the whistles range; hence would require a special messenger if needed for help. Moses Brown and John Carter went with Capt. Hopkins to the river-bank, while President Manning was detailed with Capt. Mathewson to the stone building. Dr. Bowen, with Ezra Weeden, remained in Capt. Whipples party which was to storm the farmhouse itself. The attack was to begin as soon as a messenger from Capt. Hopkins had joined Capt. Whipple to notify him of the river partys readiness. The leader would then deliver the loud single blast, and the various advance parties would commence their simultaneous attack on three points. Shortly before 1 a.m. the three divisions left the Fenner farmhouse; one to guard the landing, another to seek the river valley and the hillside door, and the third to subdivide and attend to the actual buildings of the Curwen farm.      Eleazar Smith, who accompanied the shore-guarding party, records in his diary an uneventful march and a long wait on the bluff by the bay; broken once by what seemed to be the distant sound of the signal whistle and again by a peculiar muffled blend of roaring and crying and a powder blast which seemed to come from the same direction. Later on one man thought he caught some distant gunshots, and still later Smith himself felt the throb of titanic and thunderous words resounding in upper air. It was just before dawn that a single haggard messenger with wild eyes and a hideous unknown odour about his clothing appeared and told the detachment to disperse quietly to their homes and never again think or speak of the nights doings or of him who had been Joseph Curwen. Something about the bearing of the messenger carried a conviction which his mere words could never have conveyed; for though he was a seaman well known to many of them, there was something obscurely lost or gained in his soul which set him for evermore apart. It was the same later on when they met other old companions who had gone into that zone of horror. Most of them had lost or gained something imponderable and indescribable. They had seen or heard or felt something which was not for human creatures, and could not forget it. From them there was never any gossip, for to even the commonest of mortal instincts there are terrible boundaries. And from that single messenger the party at the shore caught a nameless awe which almost sealed their own lips. Very few are the rumours which ever came from any of them, and Eleazar Smiths diary is the only written record which has survived from that whole expedition which set forth from the Sign of the Golden Lion under the stars.      Charles Ward, however, discovered another vague sidelight in some Fenner correspondence which he found in New London, where he knew another branch of the family had lived. It seems that the Fenners, from whose house the doomed farm was distantly visible, had watched the departing columns of raiders; and had heard very clearly the angry barking of the Curwen dogs, followed by the first shrill blast which precipitated the attack. This blast had been followed by a repetition of the great shaft of light from the stone building, and in another moment, after a quick sounding of the second signal ordering a general invasion, there had come a subdued prattle of musketry followed by a horrible roaring cry which the correspondent Luke Fenner had represented in his epistle by the characters \"Waaaahrrrrr - Rwaaahrrr\". This cry, however, had possessed a quality which no mere writing could convey, and the correspondent mentions that his mother fainted completely at the sound. It was later repeated less loudly, and further but more muffled evidences of gunfire ensued; together with a loud explosion of powder from the direction of the river. About an hour afterward all the dogs began to bark frightfully, and there were vague ground rumblings so marked that the candlesticks tottered on the mantelpiece. A strong smell of sulphur was noted; and Luke Fenners father declared that he heard the third or emergency whistle signal, though the others failed to detect it. Muffled musketry sounded again, followed by a deep scream less piercing but even more horrible than those which had preceded it; a kind of throaty, nastily plastic cough or gurgle whose quality as a scream must have come more from its continuity and psychological import than from its actual acoustic value.      Then the flaming thing burst into sight at a point where the Curwen farm ought to lie, and the human cries of desperate and frightened men were heard. Muskets flashed and cracked, and the flaming thing fell to the ground. A second flaming thing appeared, and a shriek of human origin was plainly distinguished. Fenner wrote that he could even gather a few words belched in frenzy: \"Almighty, protect thy lamb!\" Then there were more shots, and the second flaming thing fell. After that came silence for about three-quarters of an hour; at the end of which time little Arthur Fenner, Lukes brother, exclaimed that he saw a red fog going up to the stars from the accursed farm in the distance. No one but the child can testify to this, but Luke admits the significant coincidence implied by the panic of almost convulsive fright which at the same moment arched the backs and stiffened the fur of the three cats then within the room.      Five minutes later a chill wind blew up, and the air became suffused with such an intolerable stench that only the strong freshness of the sea could have prevented its being noticed by the shore party or by any wakeful souls in Pawtuxet village. This stench was nothing which any of the Fenners had ever encountered before, and produced a kind of clutching, amorphous fear beyond that of the tomb or the charnel-house. Close upon it came the awful voice which no hapless hearer will ever be able to forget. It thundered out of the sky like a doom, and windows rattled as its echoes died away. It was deep and musical; powerful as a bass organ, but evil as the forbidden books of the Arabs. What it said no man can tell, for it spoke in an unknown tongue, but this is the writing Luke Fenner set down to portray the daemoniac intonations: \"DEESMEES-JESHET-BONE DOSEFE DUVEMA-ENITEMOSS\". Not till the year 1919 did any soul link this crude transcript with anything else in mortal knowledge, but Charles Ward paled as he recognised what Mirandola had denounced in shudders as the ultimate horror among black magics incantations.      An unmistakably human shout or deep chorused scream seemed to answer this malign wonder from the Curwen farm, after which the unknown stench grew complex with an added odour equally intolerable. A wailing distinctly different from the scream now burst out, and was protracted ululantly in rising and falling paroxysms. At times it became almost articulate, though no auditor could trace any definite words; and at one point it seemed to verge toward the confines of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Then a yell of utter, ultimate fright and stark madness wrenched from scores of human throats - a yell which came strong and clear despite the depth from which it must have burst; after which darkness and silence ruled all things. Spirals of acrid smoke ascended to blot out the stars, though no flames appeared and no buildings were observed to be gone or injured on the following day.      Toward dawn two frightened messengers with monstrous and unplaceable odours saturating their clothing knocked at the Fenner door and requested a keg of rum, for which they paid very well indeed. One of them told the family that the affair of Joseph Curwen was over, and that the events of the night were not to be mentioned again. Arrogant as the order seemed, the aspect of him who gave it took away all resentment and lent it a fearsome authority; so that only these furtive letters of Luke Fenner, which he urged his Connecticut relative to destroy, remain to tell what was seen and heard. The non-compliance of that relative, whereby the letters were saved after all, has alone kept the matter from a merciful oblivion. Charles Ward had one detail to add as a result of a long canvass of Pawtuxet residents for ancestral traditions. Old Charles Slocum of that village said that there was known to his grandfather a queer rumour concerning a charred, distorted body found in the fields a week after the death of Joseph Curwen was announced. What kept the talk alive was the notion that this body, so far as could be seen in its burnt and twisted condition, was neither thoroughly human nor wholly allied to any animal which Pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about.6.      Not one man who participated in that terrible raid could ever be induced to say a word concerning it, and every fragment of the vague data which survives comes from those outside the final fighting party. There is something frightful in the care with which these actual raiders destroyed each scrap which bore the least allusion to the matter. Eight sailors had been killed, but although their bodies were not produced their families were satisfied with the statement that a clash with customs officers had occurred. The same statement also covered the numerous cases of wounds, all of which were extensively bandaged and treated only by Dr. Jabez Bowen, who had accompanied the party. Hardest to explain was the nameless odour clinging to all the raiders, a thing which was discussed for weeks. Of the citizen leaders, Capt. Whipple and Moses Brown were most severely hurt, and letters of their wives testify the bewilderment which their reticence and close guarding of their bandages produced. Psychologically every participant was aged, sobered, and shaken. It is fortunate that they were all strong men of action and simple, orthodox religionists, for with more subtle introspectiveness and mental complexity they would have fared ill indeed. President Manning was the most disturbed; but even he outgrew the darkest shadow, and smothered memories in prayers. Every man of those leaders had a stirring part to play in later years, and it is perhaps fortunate that this is so. Little more than a twelvemonth afterward Capt. Whipple led the mob who burnt the revenue ship Gaspee, and in this bold act we may trace one step in the blotting out of unwholesome images.      There was delivered to the widow of Joseph Curwen a sealed leaden coffin of curious design, obviously found ready on the spot when needed, in which she was told her husbands body lay. He had, it was explained, been killed in a customs battle about which it was not politic to give details. More than this no tongue ever uttered of Joseph Curwens end, and Charles Ward had only a single hint wherewith to construct a theory. This hint was the merest thread - a shaky underscoring of a passage in Jedediah Ornes confiscated letter to Curwen, as partly copied in Ezra Weedens handwriting. The copy was found in the possession of Smiths descendants; and we are left to decide whether Weeden gave it to his companion after the end, as a mute clue to the abnormality which had occurred, or whether, as is more probable, Smith had it before, and added the underscoring himself from what he had managed to extract from his friend by shrewd guessing and adroit cross-questioning. The underlined passage is merely this:      \"I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe; by the Which I meane, Any that can in Turne call up somewhat against you, whereby your Powerfullest Devices may not be of use. Ask of the Lesser, lest the Greater shall not wish to Answer, and shall commande more than you.\"In the light of this passage, and reflecting on what last unmentionable allies a beaten man might try to summon in his direst extremity, Charles Ward may well have wondered whether any citizen of Providence killed Joseph Curwen.      The deliberate effacement of every memory of the dead man from Providence life and annals was vastly aided by the influence of the raiding leaders. They had not at first meant to be so thorough, and had allowed the widow and her father and child to remain in ignorance of the true conditions; but Capt. Tillinghast was an astute man, and soon uncovered enough rumours to whet his horror and cause him to demand that his daughter and granddaughter change their name, burn the library and all remaining papers, and chisel the inscription from the slate slab above Joseph Curwens grave. He knew Capt. Whipple well, and probably extracted more hints from that bluff mariner than anyone else ever gained respecting the end of the accused sorcerer.      From that time on the obliteration of Curwens memory became increasingly rigid, extending at last by common consent even to the town records and files of the Gazette. It can be compared in spirit only to the hush that lay on Oscar Wildes name for a decade after his disgrace, and in extent only to the fate of that sinful King of Runazar in Lord Dunsanys tale, whom the Gods decided must not only cease to be, but must cease ever to have been.      Mrs. Tillinghast, as the widow became known after 1772, sold the house in Olney Court and resided with her father in Powers Lane till her death in 1817. The farm at Pawtuxet, shunned by every living soul, remained to moulder through the years; and seemed to decay with unaccountable rapidity. By 1780 only the stone and brickwork were standing, and by 1800 even these had fallen to shapeless heaps. None ventured to pierce the tangled shrubbery on the river-bank behind which the hillside door may have lain, nor did any try to frame a definite image of the scenes amidst which Joseph Curwen departed from the horrors he had wrought.      Only robust old Capt. Whipple was heard by alert listeners to mutter once in a while to himself, \"Pox on that  -  -  - , but he had no business to laugh while he screamed. Twas as though the damnd  -  -  -  had someat up his sleeve. For half a crown Id burn his  -  -  -  house.\"", "This is based off of real events that have happened to a friend of mine. The impulse Harold has at the beach, the fish, and the dream. Everything else is fictional.IHarold Durby has been my friend since the age of six, having met in kindergarten. A non-native to Florida, unlike myself, he came from Massachusetts-though where has always alluded my mother and father since Harolds single mother always changed the subject.He was a strapping brown haired, blue eyed ball of energy that it was a shock to all that he would befriend me, the class nerd-for at such a young age, I discovered the astounding information that knowledge can give. Yet, we were bound by a shared passion of the ocean. His wide knowledge and love of fish was beyond his years and was always spoken with such passion that it seemed as if he longed to swim beneath the waves forever. And as he grew, it was as if he believed he belonged there more than he did upon land and felt cursed to walk with us humans.And I found myself feeling the same way. Though it was not put to question until his forties, the first sign should have been gleaned on his nineteenth year.Walking along the lonely, early morning beach-our routine since starting high school together(though we graduated at this point)-found us gazing upon a lazy, gray sun rising out of the sea weed infested waves. Minor chit-chat and crashing waves pervaded our silence as gulls stretched their wings and took flight when, out of nowhere, Harold stopped in his tracks, head whipping towards the ocean, eyes cloudy and unfocused.\"Harold,\" I called, trying to gain his attention. \"Harold!\"He took a stiff step towards the ocean, then another, his arms out to his side, palms facing forward like the Virgin Mary as his steps increased. I tugged at his sleeve to break this trance that was placed upon him.We were a good fifteen feet out, the sand beneath us making the cresting waves come up just above his belt, being a couple inches taller than myself, when a whistle blew.\"Get out of the water!\" The lifeguard called from his position on his tower.I looked away from Harold at that moment to see the purple and red flag with a no swimming sign on it. Harold, having been brought back by the whistle, was the first to move back towards land.Panting and chilled by the wind blowing across out wet clothing, I attempted to ask my friend what came upon him. Though he was crouched over, hands on knees, I could see on his face a sort of horror and shock that I have not seen on him before.\"Harold,\" I pushed. \"What came over you?\"\"You didnt hear it?\" He asked, sounding surprised, covering up his fear.\"Hear what?\"\"Then why did you go out with me?\"\"I was trying to snap you out of it.\" I explained.\"Then you didnt hear it?\"\"Hear what?\"He dismissed my question with a shake of his head. \"Forget it, lets just go home.\"I nodded, knowing better than to drop it, but also knowing that Harold would tell me when hes ready.From then on he went to the beach a few more times, but after those times, it was strictly on the sand and never in the water. His claim was that fish kept bumping into him, which is not too unusual, for I have seen their glistening, silver bodies flash beneath the waves-but they never touched any of us, just Harold. Which made him nervous since he wouldnt hurt a fly on purpose, and the murky water doesnt offer much in the way of spying on them.IIMany years pass in a blink of an eye and I find myself in an insurance company(1), while Harold is a marine biologist professor at the local University of Central Florida. In our mid-thirties, we find ourselves successful in our occupations, yet not so in our love life-a fact our mothers love to point out. Though not from a lack of trying, both Harold and myself have tried, but my girlfriends do not last long and, for some odd reason, girls seem to find Harold oddly repulsive. A fact I cannot grasp, for he is a handsome gentleman.But we are content enough with our lives. Though, as was to be expected, since our income was good but not good enough for housing prices, we rented an apartment together.But that veil was quick to be cast away from our eyes. For Harold, from what I could gather, he had night terrors. Screaming out insane verses in tongues befitting gibberish, yet sounded so calculated, so alien, that it hadnt crossed my mind that it couldnt be actual speech. Which frightened me a great deal.And I had asked so frequently that it became routine that when he entered the small dining room that he sardonically stated-more than asked-that he had night terrors, of which I would groggily grunt in the affirmative.Forty reaches us and its like someone turned the volume off. Harold stopped the night terrors when he reached thirty six and a strange acceptance seemed to be permanently stuck on him, a great contrast to the tired and jumpy Harold that I knew during that time. A Harold whos mother would call begging me to pick him up from work because something was off.I didnt think much about it. Night terrors can be overcome, much like any phase of human development, that I was happy when this change occurred. Which then brought up an ancient mystery; the city in which he dwelled before coming to Florida.\"Innsmouth,\" He told me one day. \"Im from Innsmouth, Massachusetts. My mom finally told me.\"\"Thats nice,\" I told him. \"Any reason she told you this now?\"I did not mean for it to sound so rude, but one has to ask why wait so long to tell your son where it was he grew up. By waiting this long why not simply leaving him in the dark? Though not the best option, it seemed more practical then to tell him now. I was curious as any friend would be, though it made those attempts to find out more about the Durbys past seem asinine.His face became unreadable, in deep thought, his features seemed almost fish like in the light.\"She said I need to go back. That I need to go back for a while to understand.\"\"Understand what?\" Came my obvious question when he trailed off into silence.\"She didnt say.\"\"Well, when do you suppose youll go?\"\"This coming week. I know you have vacation time saved up, too. Id like it if you came with me to see the place of my birth and to figure out what my mother meant.\"I was happy that he would ask. Despite the fact that I never cared about that missing piece of Harold, I found myself curious about it now due to his mothers cryptic words.IIIOur first time on a plane and it was nothing like we expected. We boarded on time, but our plane was held fifteen minutes longer. Im glad Harold had the window seat for, from what I saw out of it, I would have went into a panic attack. If man were meant to fly he would have wings.For hours we were stuck up there with minor turbulence, boredom, and anxiety for what we will see once we get off in Boston where we would board a train into Arkham where a cab will need to be hailed for us to proceed into-what the internet called-a dying fishing town. From what we gathered, only a few people still lived there and many of the buildings were run down.No wonder she left. But we were to go there no matter what. For whatever Ms. Durby meant, it was obvious it was eating away at Harold. But I did not push him for details, history has shown me that he will tell me when hes ready.The train ride went off without a scene, but in Arkham, when we hailed a cab, the driver got out to open the back, passenger door when he looked at me then Harold.\"Goin to Innsmouth, eh.\" He stated rather than asked.\"Yes,\" Harold asked. \"How did you know?\"He did not answer, merely motioned for us to get in-which we did-and he got back to the front seat where he drove off without another word.\"You look like yer from there.\" The driver stated, looking at Harold.Strange enough, I had not seen the physical changes from my friend. I suppose spending such a time with someone can allow you to not notice a few things. Like his eyes, they were a dull blue now instead of the vibrant orbs they used to be. His face was becoming rounder on the sides, flatter in the front, and red welts were where neck met shoulders.He never looked that way before, and from what I gather, the people must always look like this. I was confused, but whenever either of us asked him anymore, he would remain silent. Though, when I mentioned that we shall remain there until Friday, he nodded his head and assured us hed be there.We reach Innsmouth by six in the afternoon, the sun already set and the dim glow of a crescent moon fills the night sky along with a plethora of stars you couldnt see in the city. In the dark Innsmouth looked like a deserted, ghost town-the houses and shops, as well as the odd church, looked worse for wear, giving the town an elephant graveyard appeal. The hotel our cab was stationed outside looked nice, yet drearily abandoned.The cab driver then spoke once more to us. \"Please feel free to chose your own rooms. The manager does not reside here anymore. And only two families remain here.\"\"Where is he?\" Harold asked. \"And why so few people?\"\"Out at sea,\" And with that he got back in and drove back to Arkham.With a stretch of paranoia, we climbed the steps in a solemn fashion more befitting a funeral procession than a march to your new-though for only a few days-home. The cab driver was correct, the front desk looked as if the manager had not packed up his things and headed out to sea, the only way to tell how long is to dust through layers of dust and cob-webs.\"Do you really suppose its okay to stay here?\" I asked.\"I dont like it either, but it was unlocked and from what I gather,\" he traced a finger along the banister that was against the far left wall as he ascended the stairs towards the rooms that resided up there. \"He is not coming back. But dont worry, well check the log book if we can and give him the correct amount on Friday should he return.\"I follow him up the steps and to the left theres a hallway with doors carved out of it. Its completely made of wood with generic pictures that adorn almost every hotel across the nation. Harold picks the last one on the left, closest to the end-hallway window which, no doubt, gives the hall its light since the lighting fixtures most likely dont work anymore-where as I picked the last on the right, a few feet away from the window.Our rooms were like a carbon copy from one another; a twin bed, whose head rested against the right wall, across from that the window and a bedside table and another window facing the bed with a door that conjoins rooms to the left of the bed. Throwing my satchel down, I laid on the bed, my conscious still screaming this was wrong, but the very powerful need of sleep overpowered that urge and soon I found myself asleep.The morning came upon us almost too soon, but with both windows letting the celestial orb in with glaring intensity due to dust, we woke up almost blinded.After our short celebration and shouts from room to room that the water actually worked, we showered and headed outside, hopping to meet some of the locals and grab a quick bite to eat-having not eaten since lunch yesterday.The town seemed to be cloistered together, tall brick buildings of which were, for the most part, dusty and abandoned with messy stores, one, a house, even had an upstairs bedroom in the living room. But such is the curse of time. Fortunately, the town is rather small, and as luck would have it one of the families was a baker, for their store was open and pleasant smells wafted from its ovens and like an arrow, hit the mark that was our noses.The inside was styled into a turn of the century bakery with old looking ovens with bread, cakes, and other sweets in a glass case that doubled as a counter. The woman behind it was slightly round around the middle, though the reason came from a cherubic coo in a rocking cradle that she was stooped over. Her sunflower blonde hair was in a librarians bun, her white apron splattered with spots of flour, jellies, and perhaps some genetic material that came from her baby girl.\"Hello, George, come to pick up more bread? Or is it something…\"She looks at us keenly, as if we were joined at the hip-a joke many people have said about us-or something. Then she smiles.\"Well, dont get many visitors around here anymore.\" She said, it was then that I noticed her features that were more pronounced than Harolds and her voice seemed to border on croaking, yet still managed to be cheerful.\"What brings you two boys to Innsmouth?\"\"Im Harold Durby, I was born here.\" Harold stated. I introduced myself before he continued. \"My mom said I had to come back to find my roots.\"\"Youre Alisons brat?\" She said aghast. \"Funniest thing in the world, that one-ran away. Her husband-your father-was so mad, he tore up your house.\" She leaned in closer when the baby sniffled from her mothers loud speaking. Brought their bedroom into the living room.\"I was stunned, that house, the one I thought of as being worse for wear by time, was actually destroyed by Harolds father. What man could possibly do that? And if he can do that, what would he do to Harold? I pale at the thought but the object of my worrisome thoughts break me out of it.\"What happened to my father?\" Harold asked in a manner as if he already knew.\"Went back, boy, went back. Nothing keeping him here and they can…\" She spied me. \"Does he know?\"Harold shook his head. \"Not even I know.\"She was taken aback. \"Your mom ever told you?\"Harold shook his head.\"Figures, nothing right with that one.\" She mumbles off something then smiles again. \"So, how long are you boys in Innsmouth?\"\"Till Friday,\" Harold stated. \"Just to see what I need to see.\"\"Well, come back here after closing, Ill tell you all you need to know. But come alone…We dont take well with outsiders, not like youre not, but youre more one of us than he is. No offense dear, its habit.\"I wasnt offended, merely surprised. Didnt she think Harold would tell me what she tells him? He had no real bond to this place like he did in Florida.\"Anyway, what would you boys like to eat? Dont got much, mostly we go to Ipswich to get supplies, but its a ways, so I tried to lessen our travels by cooking a few things here.\" She then gasps in remembrance. \"I almost forgot. My names Henrietta.\"We ordered our breakfast, ate it, then went on our way. The sights of Innsmouth worth seeing were few; a beach that leads to Devils Cove the docks. But everything was in ill repair, obviously having been neglected by the towns remaining population-however many is uncertain, for we only met Henrietta and her baby.IVThat night I was peacefully sleeping, dreams of sailing in violet skies, my crew and I lax upon the deck, the currents calm enough for daydreaming. But then a pale, blue hand grabbed onto my shoulder and shook me.I woke up to Harolds hand gently shaking my shoulder. A grave expression brought out stress wrinkles, his eyes set in concentration. He sighed, never looking at me as he explained what happened previously.\"I saw the elusive George.\" He explained. \"And their spouses.\"He sighs before he continues:\"You see, Innsmouth was in a bind so they made a pact with these creatures called the Deep Ones. They gave the people fish in exchange for humans to mate with as well as human sacrifices. Henrietta and George are married to them; George even gave up his house and moved to Devils Reef for her.\" He shook his head. \"Still cant get over it; how can anyone love a thing like that?\"But you see, my mother was one of the few non-hybrids left.\"\"Hybrids?\"\"Ill get to that,\" He said dismissively. \"Anyway, my mom didnt like what she was married to. That it touched her. She had me and ran away-I think because she did not want him to hurt me like he does her. She always had him locked in the attic.\"He laughs. \"You see, my friend, those night terrors, I remember ever single one. Cyclopean structures of coral and sand in some of them. In others I see my relatives, alive and kicking as hybrid creatures with blue scales and fish features. I also saw my dad. I saw him run into the night, howling in rage all the while he headed back to Devils Reef; where their city dwells. The first one was this horrible nightmare where you and I were on one of our morning walks when a giant wave crashed down on the both of us, sucking us out to sea. The problem was that you floated to the surface, but I was stuck mere feet away from it.\"\"It was scary, trying to hold in air, fighting to the top, only to discover that I can breathe. But my addled mind begs me to breach the surface, I tug on your pant leg and you notice me. You pull me up a little more then you shout out get away from me! and let me go. My hand turned into a hybrids clawed hand. I sink, fighting it as best I could until youre out of sight.\"He finally looks at me. \"Dont take this the wrong way, but the dreams of losing you were the worst.\"I place a hand on his shoulder. \"You wont lose me.\"The thought of us ever parting never crossed my mind recently. True, the threat to friendship is usually high school, but we overcame that. Were still friends. And even though this story sounds convoluted, Harold was never good at acting. Something really spooked him.\"But you will,\" He counters. \"Tonight my father is coming to take me to Yha-nthlei, their domain. I am to remain there until…\"He is cut off by the sound of something sharp scratching against glass. We both stare at either window, but whatever made that noise had disappeared. Harold stood tense.\"Hes here, I have to go now.\"\"Youre just going to leave me? After everything youre just going to leave?\" I dont know where this is coming from. A part of me screams this should have been said sooner, but I suppose it was until that moment when the reality of the situation we found ourselves in finally sunk in.He looks as if hell cry. But then a thought comes to him.\"Tomorrow at Midnight…Ill meet you at the dock closest to Devils Reef.\"We embrace, silence prevails over all in that brief moment. He breaks away first and runs out into the night.Sleep evades me the rest of the night.VThe next day I hardly venture out into town. Partly because I dare not venture out into this cursed town. A town whos inhabitants, from what I gathered yesterday, did not like outsiders. Yet, strangely enough, I did not starve. Henrietta left goodies for me outside my door with a bill since I wrote on dusty stationary the room had left over that I could not take her charity.Despite being lonely, a sense of anxiety crept over me, for midnight was drawing near.At eleven thirty I ventured out into the night, the crescent moon illuminating my way towards the dock of which our meeting would take place.Once there I only wait a minute until I hear the sound of splashing and a thud of something landing on the dock a few feet behind me. I turn, expecting to see my friend to be as I remembered from last night. But alas, he is not and with a gasp I take him all in.Naked as the day he was born, his body covered in pale, robin eggshell blue, his stomach a pale white. His two eyes have enlarged and have become pitch black orbs. His lips have become fish-like, his gums holding rows of sharp teeth, framed nicely on his hairless head; hair being replaced with frills like that of fish fins. Yet, despite the fish-like qualities, it seemed that amphibian qualities were also present.He walks towards me in an awkward gait on his webbed toes until he is close enough to cup my cheek with his webbed, right hand.The gesture was merely for comfort and reassurance that he was still himself. I grasped his hand with my own and he lets out a purr-like hiss.\"Friend,\" He croaks, his voice coming out even more awkward than his gait, as if his vocal cords were not made for such a feat, yet was able to anyway. \"Missed you.\"\"Missed you, too, Harold.\" I admitted.\"Go back to Florida. Follow you.\" He growls. \"Others hate outsiders. Unless willing to mate with Deep One…\"He looked at me with what, to the average person, would look like a blank stare due to his black eyes. But from knowing him for as long as I have I caught the apprehension in his voice.\"No, nothing against you, Harold. But Id rather not.\"He made a sound that I guessed was their way of sighing, and in his case; it was in relief.\"Will go Florida, too. But…Some days I come back here.\" He grimaced as best he could with fish lips. \"Voice…Will better.\"I pat him on the shoulder. A low growl erupts from below us.\"Dad!\" Harold hisses, his frills on his head tense up in warning. But he pays his son no heed and I hear a thump. I gaze upon his father-a pale, green, hulking sea monster-and faint.VII travel back to Florida by hiking the way to Ipswich and hail a cab back to Boston where I fly back home and go about my business in minor isolation; breaking my hermitic lifestyle to go to work. I move up the corporate ladder allowing me to afford my new house on the beach. A house isolated from others. Others with prying eyes and curious souls.Its a house where a dear, old friend can visit from his home in the sea and no one would ever be the wiser.()()()1) A reference to the protagonist in \"The Shadow Over Innsmouth\" who received a job as such before he learns the horrifying truth about his family."]}
{"id": "EN067", "pair": ["The Inn stands at the end of our largest thoroughfare, which is a few blocks long, but seems a thousand miles. With my heavy valise, Im fortunate that I only have to walk half that far from the restaurant at which Ive just dined. Once every month, I scrounge up enough money to have dinner at the Golden Goose. Despite my reputation in this village, I eventually come to long for the clamor of a crowd. The four walls of my fathers house are my sanctuary and prison otherwise. Only Theodora, our cook and housekeeper that weve had since before I was born, keeps me company there. I would take her with me on my monthly outings to Leights sole restaurant, but she stubbornly says she prefers her own meals all the same.Thats only part of the reason why she wont go, however. Ive told her that even at the Golden Goose, the diners there glare at me out of the corners of their eyes and lower them to their plates if I look their way. Theodora is an even more self-contained soul than I am, and loathes being stared at \"by all and sundry\".The evening sun is sinking low on the horizon, and the villagers around me are concealed in shadows. I dont want anyone coming up and asking me about my three-night errand - not that they would. When I prove the rumors about my forefathers establishment wrong, Ill make them all look like fools anyway!Those unfamiliar with Leight will notice three ever-present things as they travel down its main street: stalwart people, churches, and Cemetery Hill looming in the distance. Ever since I was a child, I sensed an eerie connection among these features of our humble village. Just what that is, I cannot say. They are ordinary enough on the surface, and yet I cant help feeling that theres something sinister about them.My neighbors are proud, hard-working souls. Most of them live on farms on the outskirts of town. Even so, they trudge nearly every day to its center in order to seek supplies. The men of Leight are burly, with long arms and sunburnt faces, trusting in their toil and suspicious of learnt folk. Its just as well that theyre illiterate. They wouldnt have much use for books even if they had the coin to buy them. Their wives, far from being what some people would call ladies, are just as industrious and sturdy as their husbands. I see them more often in town, as buying sundries is womens work, but that doesnt mean theyre any more inclined to talk to me. They keep to themselves, as I do, but it seems their hearts are under lock and key.I suspect that a large part of this has to do with the fact that they fear God as much as my familys past. Out of every ten buildings in Leight, at least four are churches. The Baptists, Catholics, Episcopalians, Evangelicals, Lutherans, Methodists, and even more denominations are continually at war. They each claim to believe in the Scriptures, and in the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. However, they also claim that all the others are false, to a greater or lesser degree. As for me? I attend no house of worship, and that is no great loss to me. My father, Lemuel Dawson, said that his own chapel - the one on Cemetery Hill - had been abruptly shuttered one Halloween night. His fellow congregants then fled to other nearby towns.\"My dear Millie,\" he had told me, \"the one true church on this Earth has been lost, and a year too early.\" Thats another thing Ive failed to understand, even though it haunts me as much as the Inn itself does.Hurrying to get there, I pass the people and churches without much concern. Only the visage of the former Gallows Hill, now containing graves instead of a gibbet, catches my eye. Buried there are not only the fifty-three souls who were hanged during the Purge (or so we called our witchcraft panic), but criminals and paupers. Ive often wondered why having no money is considered as great a crime as sorcery or theft, but in this village, if youre poor, then you are cursed. \"God helps those who help themselves\": so say we. I cannot help myself as I find my feet sprinting rather than walking toward the façade of the Dreamers Inn.The sky, now a cool blue-violet twilight, is growing dark. Ill soon leave light (and Leight?) behind. Even though Ive been inside the Dreamers Inn countless times, Ive always been a bit scared of the place. Why is it that, even though its supposed to be a haven for travelers, it seems like a mausoleum instead? I know that once I venture beyond its door, beneath the rickety sign that has announced its presence since the days of Abner Dawes, Ill be in a world unto itself. As such, I pause on the threshold and gaze up at its intimidating turret. Should I turn back and forget about spending a single night there, let alone three?Then I remember my reasons, both monetary and otherwise, and step inside.", "VII.Yet all this was only the prologue of the actual Dunwich horror. Formalities were gone through by bewildered officials, abnormal details were duly kept from press and public, and men were sent to Dunwich and Aylesbury to look up property and notify any who might be heirs of the late Wilbur Whateley. They found the countryside in great agitation, both because of the growing rumblings beneath the domed hills, and because of the unwonted stench and the surging, lapping sounds which came increasingly from the great empty shell formed by Whateley’s boarded-up farmhouse. Earl Sawyer, who tended the horse and cattle during Wilbur’s absence, had developed a woefully acute case of nerves. The officials devised excuses not to enter the noisome boarded place; and were glad to confine their survey of the deceased’s living quarters, the newly mended sheds, to a single visit. They filed a ponderous report at the court-house in Aylesbury, and litigations concerning heirship are said to be still in progress amongst the innumerable Whateleys, decayed and undecayed, of the upper Miskatonic valley.      An almost interminable manuscript in strange characters, written in a huge ledger and adjudged a sort of diary because of the spacing and the variations in ink and penmanship, presented a baffling puzzle to those who found it on the old bureau which served as its owner’s desk. After a week of debate it was sent to Miskatonic University, together with the deceased’s collection of strange books, for study and possible translation; but even the best linguists soon saw that it was not likely to be unriddled with ease. No trace of the ancient gold with which Wilbur and Old Whateley always paid their debts has yet been discovered.      It was in the dark of September 9th that the horror broke loose. The hill noises had been very pronounced during the evening, and dogs barked frantically all night. Early risers on the 10th noticed a peculiar stench in the air. About seven o’clock Luther Brown, the hired boy at George Corey’s, between Cold Spring Glen and the village, rushed frenziedly back from his morning trip to Ten-Acre Meadow with the cows. He was almost convulsed with fright as he stumbled into the kitchen; and in the yard outside the no less frightened herd were pawing and lowing pitifully, having followed the boy back in the panic they shared with him. Between gasps Luther tried to stammer out his tale to Mrs. Corey.      “Up thar in the rud beyont the glen, Mis’ Corey—they’s suthin’ ben thar! It smells like thunder, an’ all the bushes an’ little trees is pushed back from the rud like they’d a haouse ben moved along of it. An’ that ain’t the wust, nuther. They’s prints in the rud, Mis’ Corey—great raound prints as big as barrel-heads, all sunk daown deep like a elephant had ben along, only they’s a sight more nor four feet could make! I looked at one or two afore I run, an’ I see every one was covered with lines spreadin’ aout from one place, like as if big palm-leaf fans—twict or three times as big as any they is—hed of ben paounded daown into the rud. An’ the smell was awful, like what it is araound Wizard Whateley’s ol’ haouse. . . .”      Here he faltered, and seemed to shiver afresh with the fright that had sent him flying home. Mrs. Corey, unable to extract more information, began telephoning the neighbours; thus starting on its rounds the overture of panic that heralded the major terrors. When she got Sally Sawyer, housekeeper at Seth Bishop’s, the nearest place to Whateley’s, it became her turn to listen instead of transmit; for Sally’s boy Chauncey, who slept poorly, had been up on the hill toward Whateley’s, and had dashed back in terror after one look at the place, and at the pasturage where Mr. Bishop’s cows had been left out all night.      “Yes, Mis’ Corey,” came Sally’s tremulous voice over the party wire, “Cha’ncey he just come back a-postin’, and couldn’t haff talk fer bein’ scairt! He says Ol’ Whateley’s haouse is all blowed up, with the timbers scattered raound like they’d ben dynamite inside; only the bottom floor ain’t through, but is all covered with a kind o’ tar-like stuff that smells awful an’ drips daown offen the aidges onto the graoun’ whar the side timbers is blown away. An’ they’s awful kinder marks in the yard, tew—great raound marks bigger raound than a hogshead, an’ all sticky with stuff like is on the blowed-up haouse. Cha’ncey he says they leads off into the medders, whar a great swath wider’n a barn is matted daown, an’ all the stun walls tumbled every whichway wherever it goes.      “An’ he says, says he, Mis’ Corey, as haow he sot to look fer Seth’s caows, frighted ez he was; an’ faound ’em in the upper pasture nigh the Devil’s Hop Yard in an awful shape. Haff on ’em’s clean gone, an’ nigh haff o’ them that’s left is sucked most dry o’ blood, with sores on ’em like they’s ben on Whateley’s cattle ever senct Lavinny’s black brat was born. Seth he’s gone aout naow to look at ’em, though I’ll vaow he wun’t keer ter git very nigh Wizard Whateley’s! Cha’ncey didn’t look keerful ter see whar the big matted-daown swath led arter it leff the pasturage, but he says he thinks it p’inted towards the glen rud to the village.      “I tell ye, Mis’ Corey, they’s suthin’ abroad as hadn’t orter be abroad, an’ I for one think that black Wilbur Whateley, as come to the bad eend he desarved, is at the bottom of the breedin’ of it. He wa’n’t all human hisself, I allus says to everybody; an’ I think he an’ Ol’ Whateley must a raised suthin’ in that there nailed-up haouse as ain’t even so human as he was. They’s allus ben unseen things araound Dunwich—livin’ things—as ain’t human an’ ain’t good fer human folks.      “The graoun’ was a-talkin’ lass night, an’ towards mornin’ Cha’ncey he heerd the whippoorwills so laoud in Col’ Spring Glen he couldn’t sleep nun. Then he thought he heerd another faint-like saound over towards Wizard Whateley’s—a kinder rippin’ or tearin’ o’ wood, like some big box er crate was bein’ opened fur off. What with this an’ that, he didn’t git to sleep at all till sunup, an’ no sooner was he up this mornin’, but he’s got to go over to Whateley’s an’ see what’s the matter. He see enough, I tell ye, Mis’ Corey! This dun’t mean no good, an’ I think as all the men-folks ought to git up a party an’ do suthin’. I know suthin’ awful’s abaout, an’ feel my time is nigh, though only Gawd knows jest what it is.      “Did your Luther take accaount o’ whar them big tracks led tew? No? Wal, Mis’ Corey, ef they was on the glen rud this side o’ the glen, an’ ain’t got to your haouse yet, I calc’late they must go into the glen itself. They would do that. I allus says Col’ Spring Glen ain’t no healthy nor decent place. The whippoorwills an’ fireflies there never did act like they was creaters o’ Gawd, an’ they’s them as says ye kin hear strange things a-rushin’ an’ a-talkin’ in the air daown thar ef ye stand in the right place, atween the rock falls an’ Bear’s Den.”      By that noon fully three-quarters of the men and boys of Dunwich were trooping over the roads and meadows between the new-made Whateley ruins and Cold Spring Glen, examining in horror the vast, monstrous prints, the maimed Bishop cattle, the strange, noisome wreck of the farmhouse, and the bruised, matted vegetation of the fields and roadsides. Whatever had burst loose upon the world had assuredly gone down into the great sinister ravine; for all the trees on the banks were bent and broken, and a great avenue had been gouged in the precipice-hanging underbrush. It was as though a house, launched by an avalanche, had slid down through the tangled growths of the almost vertical slope. From below no sound came, but only a distant, undefinable foetor; and it is not to be wondered at that the men preferred to stay on the edge and argue, rather than descend and beard the unknown Cyclopean horror in its lair. Three dogs that were with the party had barked furiously at first, but seemed cowed and reluctant when near the glen. Someone telephoned the news to the Aylesbury Transcript; but the editor, accustomed to wild tales from Dunwich, did no more than concoct a humorous paragraph about it; an item soon afterward reproduced by the Associated Press.      That night everyone went home, and every house and barn was barricaded as stoutly as possible. Needless to say, no cattle were allowed to remain in open pasturage. About two in the morning a frightful stench and the savage barking of the dogs awakened the household at Elmer Frye’s, on the eastern edge of Cold Spring Glen, and all agreed that they could hear a sort of muffled swishing or lapping sound from somewhere outside. Mrs. Frye proposed telephoning the neighbours, and Elmer was about to agree when the noise of splintering wood burst in upon their deliberations. It came, apparently, from the barn; and was quickly followed by a hideous screaming and stamping amongst the cattle. The dogs slavered and crouched close to the feet of the fear-numbed family. Frye lit a lantern through force of habit, but knew it would be death to go out into that black farmyard. The children and the womenfolk whimpered, kept from screaming by some obscure, vestigial instinct of defence which told them their lives depended on silence. At last the noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful moaning, and a great snapping, crashing, and crackling ensued. The Fryes, huddled together in the sitting-room, did not dare to move until the last echoes died away far down in Cold Spring Glen. Then, amidst the dismal moans from the stable and the daemoniac piping of late whippoorwills in the glen, Selina Frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she could of the second phase of the horror.      The next day all the countryside was in a panic; and cowed, uncommunicative groups came and went where the fiendish thing had occurred. Two titan swaths of destruction stretched from the glen to the Frye farmyard, monstrous prints covered the bare patches of ground, and one side of the old red barn had completely caved in. Of the cattle, only a quarter could be found and identified. Some of these were in curious fragments, and all that survived had to be shot. Earl Sawyer suggested that help be asked from Aylesbury or Arkham, but others maintained it would be of no use. Old Zebulon Whateley, of a branch that hovered about half way between soundness and decadence, made darkly wild suggestions about rites that ought to be practiced on the hill-tops. He came of a line where tradition ran strong, and his memories of chantings in the great stone circles were not altogether connected with Wilbur and his grandfather.      Darkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organise for real defence. In a few cases closely related families would band together and watch in the gloom under one roof; but in general there was only a repetition of the barricading of the night before, and a futile, ineffective gesture of loading muskets and setting pitchforks handily about. Nothing, however, occurred except some hill noises; and when the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had gone as swiftly as it had come. There were even bold souls who proposed an offensive expedition down in the glen, though they did not venture to set an actual example to the still reluctant majority.      When night came again the barricading was repeated, though there was less huddling together of families. In the morning both the Frye and the Seth Bishop households reported excitement among the dogs and vague sounds and stenches from afar, while early explorers noted with horror a fresh set of the monstrous tracks in the road skirting Sentinel Hill. As before, the sides of the road shewed a bruising indicative of the blasphemously stupendous bulk of the horror; whilst the conformation of the tracks seemed to argue a passage in two directions, as if the moving mountain had come from Cold Spring Glen and returned to it along the same path. At the base of the hill a thirty-foot swath of crushed shrubbery saplings led steeply upward, and the seekers gasped when they saw that even the most perpendicular places did not deflect the inexorable trail. Whatever the horror was, it could scale a sheer stony cliff of almost complete verticality; and as the investigators climbed around to the hill’s summit by safer routes they saw that the trail ended—or rather, reversed—there.      It was here that the Whateleys used to build their hellish fires and chant their hellish rituals by the table-like stone on May-Eve and Hallowmass. Now that very stone formed the centre of a vast space thrashed around by the mountainous horror, whilst upon its slightly concave surface was a thick and foetid deposit of the same tarry stickiness observed on the floor of the ruined Whateley farmhouse when the horror escaped. Men looked at one another and muttered. Then they looked down the hill. Apparently the horror had descended by a route much the same as that of its ascent. To speculate was futile. Reason, logic, and normal ideas of motivation stood confounded. Only old Zebulon, who was not with the group, could have done justice to the situation or suggested a plausible explanation.      Thursday night began much like the others, but it ended less happily. The whippoorwills in the glen had screamed with such unusual persistence that many could not sleep, and about 3 A.M. all the party telephones rang tremulously. Those who took down their receivers heard a fright-mad voice shriek out, “Help, oh, my Gawd! . . .” and some thought a crashing sound followed the breaking off of the exclamation. There was nothing more. No one dared do anything, and no one knew till morning whence the call came. Then those who had heard it called everyone on the line, and found that only the Fryes did not reply. The truth appeared an hour later, when a hastily assembled group of armed men trudged out to the Frye place at the head of the glen. It was horrible, yet hardly a surprise. There were more swaths and monstrous prints, but there was no longer any house. It had caved in like an egg-shell, and amongst the ruins nothing living or dead could be discovered. Only a stench and a tarry stickiness. The Elmer Fryes had been erased from Dunwich."]}
{"id": "EN088", "pair": ["The world we live in is not as it seems. I, James White, write this document so that others may be made aware of what I have experienced and know of the dangers that lurk beneath our limited perception of \"reality\". Whether you believe me or not, dear reader, is up to you. I only ask that you read what I write with an open mind since I write, not for my own gain, but to warn you of what I can only describe as \"pure evil\".I had never heard of the \"Cult of Cthulhu\" before I began university in the late summer of 2012. I was only eighteen years old, an atheist, and dogmatically pursued scientific understanding and knowledge. At that time, I was not in the least bit interested in weird cults and other religious movements, which I simply dismissed as primitive superstition. Had I but known what I would encounter, I would have burnt the science textbook, prayed to God for the strength not to crumble into insanity and got as far away from that university as I could!The strange happenings started less than two months into my first term. I had been put into student accommodation and shared a corridor with four other boys and two girls. I had got to know my flatmates very well until all of a sudden, one of the boys by the name of Jonathan Mears disappeared. This wasnt looked upon as weird at first since Jonathan was the quiet type anyway and often spent long hours alone in his room. The suspicions arose however, when he hadnt shown his face for three days. His absence was brought up one evening as we sat in a communal area.\"Hes probably just been very busy lately,\" my best friend, Jacob Shields, said. \"You know Jonathan. When he sets his mind on something, he doesnt stop until hes achieved whatever hes trying to do.\"\"Isnt it a bit strange though?\" Annie Roberts, a lovely blonde girl from the room directly across the corridor asked. \"I mean, hes in our corridor and we havent seen him for ages. Not even in the kitchen or lecture halls.\"\"It isnt like him to miss a lecture,\" I agreed. Jacob merely waved these concerns away.\"If we havent seen him by tomorrow evening, well go to the reception and see whats happening,\" he said cheerfully.But Jonathan didnt show up the following day and, as planned, my entire corridor went to the reception desk to ask if anything had happened to him. The receptionist, an elderly lady, checked through the files on a computer before looking up at us.\"Im afraid he has left the university,\" she informed us. \"He dropped out four days ago.\"\"Well there you go!\" Jacob exclaimed. \"Nothing to worry about!\"But there was something to worry about. Even though I now had every reason to think that Jonathan was fine, I couldnt shake that feeling of foreboding. He had seemed happy in university and was consistently getting high marks so I resolved to check things out for myself.I waited until 3:00 the following morning, and in the darkness, I tiptoed along the corridor to Jonathans room. Using a paperclip, I carefully picked the lock on his door and let myself in. I closed the door behind me and switched on the light. The sight that greeted me came as a huge shock. Clothes still lay on the floor, the bed was made, books were still on the shelves and a laptop was still humming gently on the cluttered desk. In short, it looked as though Jonathan was simply out of the room. If he had gone home, why did he leave all his things behind? And if he hadnt, where was he and why did the university records state that he had? Deeply concerned, I left the room and returned to my own. I lay awake in the darkness pondering the thoughts in my head and finally decided that I needed to find out what had happened and that I would do so alone...", "In relating the circumstances which have led to my confinement within this refuge for the demented, I am aware that my present position will create a natural doubt of the authenticity of my narrative. It is an unfortunate fact that the men who watch over me in this infernal building are too limited by their mental vision to weigh with patience and intelligence isolated phenomena such as that which I have experienced. All of the men, that is, with the exception of one, a Mister Slater, to whom I have related my story, and who has agreed to have it published. Men of broader intellect know that there is no sharp distinction betwixt the real and the unreal; that all things appear as they do only by virtue of the delicate individual physical and mental media through which we are made conscious of them.My name is Eldritch Fenton, and my tale is begins in the forest with my friend Joseph and a person named Riley Marsh, whom I had long believed to be a young girl. I had been infatuated with the pale-skin, brown-eyed, and raven-haired girl for around a full year now. Of course, so had my friend Joseph, for an almost equal period of time. We were riding our bikes through the lush woods under a gray sky one September afternoon when I turned around to notice Rileys sudden absence. We called for her in this part of the forest, hitherto unknown to us, but could not locate the girl.After just around half an hour, me and Joseph happened upon a terrible discovery. Buried in the side of a cliff on the opposite side of a lake was a large metal construct, that I would later discover was built by no earthen hands, with no earthen tools, of no earthen material, for no earthen purpose. A rusted metal bridge extended from the construct across the pond. We foolishly entered.Upon our entry, it was blatant by the sheer size of the stairwell, the height of what appeared o be computer consoles, and the mass of alien hieroglyphs littered on the walls and ceiling that this ship, as I had determined it to be, was not designed for use by human beings. A colossal cylinder stood in the center of the chamber, a strange energy, almost alive, emanating from it.My mind exploded suddenly. I could feel the presence of many slumbering creatures throughout the ancient vessel. Our unwanted presence in a piece of their world had disturbed them from their dreams. I could feel many more ship like this one, older than the planet Earth itself, scattered over this planet. I saw visions of terrible creatures unlike anything indigenous to our small, insignificant world. I saw worlds, in their entirety, populated by things of all forms, and of colors unknown to the eyes of man.I hadnt noticed that my mental shock had caused me to collapse to the floor, or that Joseph had come to my aid. The small boy tried to lift me, but I had to do most of the work with my own strength. Thats when Rileys beautiful, soft voice came into my mind.Kill him, she said within my thoughts. Destroy him, and we can be together for the rest of time. Given the strain the ordeal had on my mind, and the appeal of the result, I happily took up a piece of rubble from the floor and obliged. His screams as I broke his bones barely seemed important until after the event had taken place. Even now, his death at my hands has little effect on me. Though a recent realization, I always remember having nothing for contempt for the boy whose life had just been dashed by the rock wielded by me.The object of my affections appeared behind me. I turned to meet her beautiful face. It was perfectly as I remembered it, with the exception of here eyes, which had turned from an unremarkable brown to a majestic rose red. She touched my face and looked at the corpse on the cold, metal floor.\"Good. I never cared for him anyway.\" She chuckled maliciously. Then something simultaneously thrilling and horrifying happened. A pair of lumps rose in the back of her shirt. A pair of octopi-like tentacles then extended from her back like wings and began touching the corpse tenderly. The tendrils split at their ends and covered the cold shell of a body completely for several seconds. She screamed and her color came to her once pale skin. The tentacles receded and Josephs body was nowhere to be found.\"That was good, Eldritch.\" She laughed girlishly. \"But Im going to need more than that if you want to be with me forever.\" She flipped her hair and waked away. I followed her.That night my dreams were haunted by the same images I was struck with in the spacecraft. I saw monsters of flesh, metal, and energy on strange worlds never before seen by human beings. I saw myself taking the life of the little wretch Joseph over and over and over again. Mostly I saw the beautiful face of the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. Our minds were connected now. I could feel her thoughts and see her sights. We communicated with each other throughout the night. It was the best surge of emotions I had ever experienced.The following afternoon I had been out walking when I had taken my next life. Josephs death had been in the papers that morning, as well as on the local news. Only Riley and I knew the truth, however. I thought about everything that happened yesterday when Butch Robertson, the local bully, turned from around a corner, pounding his right fist into his left hand.\"Well, well, well.\" The mountainous boy said. \"Look what we have here. I noticed there was no transaction at lunch today. Why is that? Am I not good enough to deserve your payment? Hmm? Do I not deserve it? Well, then. I suppose well have to do this the hard way.\"He ran and swung at me. Feeling an uncontrollable urge to kill for my love again, I dodged out of the way and pushed him down the steep slope into a group of trees. He was still alive, though. He tried to stand up, but his leg appeared to be broken. He screamed and cursed at me from below, before he started trembling at the sight of two long, green tendrils. The appendages enveloped him and performed the same arcane process they performed on Joseph.That was wonderful, Eldritch. But I still need a little more, love. She laughed cutely. I had to get more bodies for her. Otherwise she would stop loving me, and all of my hard work would have been in vain!So I continued for a month. I preyed upon the small, the weak, the sick. I felt abominable for my actions. But the importance of the lives of these animals did not concern me as much as the welfare of Riley, or Ygtthaa , as I learned her true name to be on her home world. She needed me to kill for the meaningless animals for her, and I was more than happy to oblige.She also gave me a book. It was a strange book. The Necronomicon. She said it was by a man named Abdul Alhazred a long time ago. Though I could not at first, my present state has rendered me able to translate its arcane symbols and language. It contains mention of the \"Old Ones,\" the species to which Riley belonged. They had been here a very long time. And I was helping them reawaken by feeding Riley. She promised I would be spared when they were at full power, and I would be kept as her husband.But then that night came. I was out gathering more food for Riley. The town was in total panic now, but it didnt matter to me. It was late when I arrived at my empty, silent house. As soon as I heard my dog whimpering, a ghastly thought occurred to me. I ran into my room to find Rileys tentacles retracting. Her skin was now healthy looking, and her eyes were now a vibrant but terrible blood red. Two reptilian wings sprouted from her back and her now more numerous tendrils hung freely. I stared in terror at her, almost at tears.\"Aw, come on! I was hungry! Please forgive me? I love you!\" She pleaded. I ran. I ran to the only place I knew where to run.I reached the extraterrestrial ship in about a half an hour. I climbed the massive steps. I could feel Riley behind me, flying with her newly rediscovered wings. Acting quickly, I took up a piece of rubble larger than the one I took Josephs life with. I couldnt reach the computer consoles, but I began to destroy the lower parts of the machines. I heard creatures begin to awaken and crawl through the vents. The energy from the large cylinder in the chamber surged. It beckoned for me to see what was inside. When enough damage was done to the machines, and I could feel Riley nearing me, I walked to the cylinder and stared upward. It opened, almost as if on its own, and revealed its secrets to me.What I saw was so unimaginably, unequivocally horrifying, I cannot bring myself to describe it thoroughly. It challenged my perception of everything. My knowledge was refuted. My idea of right and wrong was destroyed. All I knew was that we mean nothing to the universe, we earthlings. And the eyes! Oh, dear God! The eyes!I awoke later, strangely unscathed, in the wreckage of the ship. It had been obliterated. Destroyed, in a great breath of fire. I was collected by the local police and the ship was searched by military units in green armor. I was shipped to an asylum near Miskatonic University in Arkham, Massachutesetts. Here, Mr. Slater has agreed to write down my story. I leave you with this knowledge. The old ones are real. Riley, Ygtthaa, is still killing people. I still feel her. She still begs me to come help her. But the strangest part is, in some deep, dark part of my mind, that I dare not visit……I still love her."]}

Their destination was the house of the village woodcutter and charcoal-burner, a place that also doubled as a furniture workshop and, importantly for this journey, the villages firearms armory.\"Not that bad. Ive been doing domestic work for the past few days but neither Noc nor his wife seems to really be a slave driver. Actually, they feel more like people who understand that theyre training a new servant.\" Joseph thought on something. \"Im actually surprised that he and the other hunters allowing me to accompany them. They neither seem to respect me or anyone who would stoop to use a gun, so I wonder why they changed their attitude.\"It was here that Marie began ruminating on something, an old thought that had given her more than her share of bad dreams. \"There are some things worth surrendering pride for, Joseph. Tell me, have you seen those weird scars on the ankles and arms of Nocs wife?\"\"You mean those marks that look like Giant Squid wounds? Yes, but what about them?\" Joseph suddenly stopped. \"What are they, anyway?\"Having stopped also, Marie sighed, a sense of foreboding covering her features. \"When I asked that myself, they didnt tell me much more than the stories Id already heard when I was a kid: legends about ghosts, devils from the mist, shadows that drink blood is what they called them sometimes. But what I got here is that those Shugoran priests that saved my people werent just going to somewhere. They were running ifrom/i somewhere, someone or something, something that no one is willing to talk any further about.\" Marie started forward again at such a pace that her boyfriend had to hurry to catch up.Getting the feeling that nothing more was going to be answered on that subject for a good while, Joseph changed track. \"How are the others getting on? Ive been stuck in the house most of the day and I havent really had a chance to talk to either the Prof or my classmates.\"Happy to shift from thoughts of chilling horror, Marie chuckled with increasing mirth as she began going back up the trail. \"From what Ive heard, Alberts been filming every step in the bronze making process that he can, not to mention all the casting processes and various uses of equipment. The only reason that he hasnt been thrown out yet is because the familys elder patriarch has taken a liking to… well, not just him, but all of you guys, just from the descriptions alone. Your Professor and his assistant have basically locked themselves in the temple: no word out yet, but I assume that theyre observing normal operations. As for Tracy…\" Here, Marie began acting a little odd. \"She talks in her sleep, if you didnt know.\"\"Really?\" Joseph responded interestedly. Not reacting the way that she had feared, Marie relaxed a little from the paranoia she had been wrangling with.\"Yeah, and the strange thing is that its in… well, tree-ish. And then theres the tattooing on her back as well.\" Marie went on talking, relieved that her fear seemed to have been senseless.Before he could answer his girlfriends increasingly chatty descriptions, a thought crossed Josephs mind on exactly why such a thing might be mentioned. \"Why would you ask me if I knew…\" Then the realization hit him and he stopped cold. \"Were you thinking that… Tracy and I?\"Marie stopped as well. \"Its not unknown to happen, you know.\" Marie answered the implied question almost defensively, as if trying to justify her momentary paranoia. \"Sweethearts get separated and sometimes… one finds companionship elsewhere. Especially with, you know.\" Marie tapped the side of her head, indicating the \"visitors\" that had first cursed Joseph Claytons existence during High School.Joseph snorted in an amused, disparaging way. \"Please dont give them that much credit. Ive ignored, rebuked and insulted those jerks so many times that Ive made a virtual bloodsport out of it. Besides, if Id made any moves towards Tracy, Albert would have killed me.\"\"Wait, those two… theyre together?\" Marie asked, wondering how shed missed that.\"Intimately so, yes.\" This was all Joseph was willing to say, himself not wishing to examine too closely the memory of walking in on his dorm-mate and his girl when they had neglected to put a sock on the doorknob. \"Anyway, as to these voices, I went to the psychology department to see if I could discover just what was causing it.\"Marie waited a heartbeat before plunging into the vital question. \"And what did they say?\" If her boyfriend did indeed have Schizophrenia, then he needed help: drugs to control the symptoms and perhaps therapy to help him conquer whatever dark corners of his psyche were feeding these voices.If it was something else… then perhaps the local sorcerers might need to be consulted before long.Joseph sighed. Whatever is going on inside my head, the geeks with the scanning equipment are pretty sure that this isnt a case of medical Schizophrenia. They say that the symptoms are all wrong, the voices arent persuasive enough… and that I dont have any of the telltale injuries on the brain that would suggest medical reasons. And then there was the time they hooked me up to the EEG during one of my episodes.\" He paused, wondering just how to proceed but, since he was already experiencing strange things, he decided just to press on. \"The guys swore that, before the equipment shorted out, at least two additional wavelengths were being read beside mine.\" With a shrug, Joseph summed up his thoughts. \"Ever since I came here and heard all of the seemingly crazy stories from you and the others… I dont know, but what Ive gone through just makes sense now, at least in knowing that it actually can happen.\"Marie smiled. Yes, we definitely need to consult the priests. \"Come on, weve talked enough and you need to get that rifle before you head out.\"And rifles there were, all secured inside a triple locked room in the back corner of the woodcutters house. They looked like Berthier carbines, French bolt-action repeaters from the First World War… but they were not the only guns present. \"Is that a Hotchkiss?\" Joseph asked in a voice combining bemusement and astonishment. Among the rifles and a few, scattered revolvers sat a machine-gun still on its tripod and looking impossibly well-maintained for being kept in the back room of a house located in a tropical moist forest.\"An M1914 by the looks of it, if the pictures Ive seen are at all accurate. Theres a story behind it, but I only know that only the oldest elders know it.\" Marie replied, having picked up of the Berthier Carbines and handing it to Joseph. The ammunition was kept in a chest under a trapdoor in the main part of the house as a safety measure so theyd have to go back to pick it up. But then she asked the question that she probably should have asked before they left the village proper. \"Speaking of guns, since when did you shoot?\"\"Theres a gun range in Arkham; Tracy and Albert invited me along for a few lessons before Thanksgiving. Shes the one with actual hunting experience and I think he only came along to check out the engineering on the pieces. It wasnt that much fun, but I think what I learned in getting my license will help on this.\" Joseph began inspecting the carbine he had been given, finding it oiled and well-maintained as any other firearm in the room. There was a question that had to be asked, however?Where did they get all these guns?15 minutes LaterMarie walked up the stairs to her grandparents house. She was supposed to act as a translator and informant for the expedition, having prior contacts inside the community and being a member first by blood and more recently by initiation. Truth be told, she had a feeling that old Tsan was really acting as gatekeeper in his interactions with Professor Andover while she was playing the part of a more convenient and mobile ambassador, Tsan having never left the temple save by palanquin in almost forty years.Walking in the door, Marie was unprepared for another surprise. She saw Tracy sitting before the camera as her Grandmother and Aunt watched, waiting to begin filming the days questions and activities, even making a short introductory statement... but not in English.\"And as soon as the translator gets here, well begin the second day of... Hey Marie, you almost scared me there.\" Here was an audible note of guilt as Tracy hastily switched from the strange language that she had been using to the carefully modulated, Patsy Cline-accented English she had used since Marie had met her. Marie had heard it, and Tracy knew that she had heard... and Marie knew that Tracy knew.\"Yeah, Ive gotten that reaction a few times since I got here.\" Marie joked, knowing that humor had the power to break tension. \"So... what language were you speaking in anyway? Im afraid I didnt recognize anything about it.\" Her female elders watched closely, knowing that something had happened but being ignorant of other languages, were unsure of exactly what.Tracy grinned bitterly. \"Id be more surprised if you did recognize it. Its... well, its not really a language per se, but a patois of a couple languages, with Early Modern English, Ohio Valley Shawnee, Coastal Algonquian, some Iroquoian loanwords having to do with ritual and bits of Eastern Siouan.\" Tracy let out the deep breath she had been using to list all those languages. She was getting more comfortable now. \"I guess it wont do any harm if I told you, seeing as were almost in the same boat.\"Tracy beckoned Marie to sit, turning off the camera as she did. \"The kids in my town learn it... well, sort of as a first language; English is really more of a first-and-a-half language for us. We got exposed to it through TV and then when we went to school, but most of our formative years were spent listening to and absorbing the patois around the house. Most of us never really let go of it as a language for our own private conversations.\"Marie reflected on this... but was also noting some of the features on Tracys face: the high, rounded cheeks, her high-bridged nose, the way that her eyes were less the bright crystal blue of stereotype and more of a dark, cloudy blue resembling ultramarine. \"I hope you dont mind me saying this, Tracy but does your family have any Native American ancestry? I dont mean to pry, but you do kind of have the look.\"Tracy considered this for a moment before giving an affirmative nod. \"My fathers paternal grandmother was from the Oklahoma Kiowa. My mother, as far as can be traced, is also about an eighth, this time one-eighth Shawnee, which seems to be the median for Longhouse.\" She got an odd, contemplative look on my face. \"Thats another one of those things that we try not to mention to outsiders, even though they tend to notice it anyway. Back in the old days, admitting it would have been a quick ticket to using a segregated washroom or worse. And now?\" Tracy shrugged. \"Now its considered cool, while the inbreeding still makes us look like freaks.\"Marie decided to test something, just for her own sake. \"Albert doesnt seem to think youre a freak.\" The more she thought about it, she had more in common with Tracy than first realized. Both of them had lived life right on the edge of themselves and their kin being recognized as something other, something foreign to the perceived natural order of the world. Both of them could sense the threat of possible revelation... and knew what it was to try to trust someone with these secrets.\"Hey, youre talking about a guy whose family has worked for alien mushroom bugs for the last hundred years. A bit of mild inbreeding is probably the most normal thing Als ever experienced.\" Here there was definitely affection to her voice, a cue that no matter what other strangeness they were involved in, there was a loving relationship between the two.At this thought Marie smiled, thanking the ancestors for a little bit of normalcy in this year-long cavalcade of oddities that she had flung herself into. Then another question sprang forth. \"Did you know about the whole alien thing when you guys were at Miskatonic?\"Tracy shook her head. \"No, but then again, he was always kinda spacey.\" Marie couldnt help but giggle at this bad pun. Tracy went on, the affection still in her voice. \"Seriously, the thing about Miskatonic is that, after awhile, you begin getting the feeling that almost everyone else is holding something close to their chest, thinking each word over before saying it. Its then that you realize that... youre not alone, that almost everyone else is as paranoid as you are, having something to hide.\" She looked towards Marie. \"Everyone except for your Joseph, that is. The only thing strange about him that I noticed was that romance was nowhere on his radar at all.\"\"Youd be surprised, actually.\" Marie answered cryptically. Before Tracy could ask, she turned back the camera back on, signaling the beginning of the interview session.That eveningSweaty, hot, dirty and exhausted, Joseph Clayton exited the forest with Noc and the other hunters. Between all of them, the hunters had brought down a Sambar stag and three small muntjacs. Joseph, for his part, had escaped being gored by a wild boar only by dodging its charge, rolling into a hollow under a log and then shooting it in the head at point-blank range when it tried to go after him. For this feat, the hunters designated him \"master of the pit\" when they roasted it at tonights feast. It had sounded like an honorable title, but Joseph could guess that they were making him little more than a cook, a traditionally female position.Still, it was an in and it would probably be research gold.He was entirely less enthusiastic about what else was coming back with them.When he and the group of hunters came into the village proper, he saw Marie and the taller, paler form of Tracy coming towards him, having been up on the family terrace transplanting rice seedlings. Due to her fair skin, Tracy was wearing the largest hat she could while her arms and shins had been slathered with sunblock. Marie had already taken hers off.As they neared him, Marie slowed to a stop, seeing the grim look on Josephs face. Tracy looked at her in confusion, then at Joseph and from his stony face understood that something was wrong. \"What is it?\" Marie asked her boyfriend.Joseph sighed. \"When the hunters brought us in, were we supposed to be for any kind of important sacrifice?\"\"Well, the Rhinoceros Festival is supposed to happen any day now. Its when we recharge the mist that surrounds the village to keep us hidden.\" Marie looked around Joseph to where one of the hunters was leading a group of people into the village. They looked like quite a bedraggled bunch, many of them thin and in questionable health. There were also two women who may have been considered beautiful if not for the look in their eyes that they had been through several levels of hell before coming here.But for all these conditions, they did not look frightened of their tattooed guides.Noticing where Marie was looking, Joseph offered explanation. \"We met up with them about a mile down the trail. Apparently the government sent up street people as some fresh blood for you guys. And thats not all. Apparently...\" Here, he lowered his voice \"One of the families that were living incognito in Vinh got killed a few nights ago: Father, mother, twelve year old boy... from what I heard it sounded like some sort of animal tore them up inside their apartment... and no blood was spilled.\"Tracy looked like she was going to vomit at the news, while a look of dread overcame Marie, as old legends came forth out of the terrifying mist of childhood nightmare to become shadows in the waking world. \"Is there anything else?\" Marie asked quietly.Now it was Josephs turn to look back at the party coming out of the forest, which were now carrying a man by his hands and feet on a pole, his mouth gagged and his eyes blindfolded. \"Only that they also sent you a sacrifice. From what they said, hes a drug-runner, sexual slaver and a general bad example of low-level underworld scum.\"Marie, still in shock over the news of the murders, was perhaps not picking and choosing the words coming out of her mouth. \"Which mean hes gonna taste worse than the fish sauce.\"At these words, both gruesome and almost ridiculous, both her lover and her friend goggled at her.", "Spoonbill Village, Northernmost Quang Binh Province, SRVJune 30, 2011.Dreaming of the past was no strange thing for Joseph Clayton over the past year. Before yesterday, the memory had been of his and Maries last farewell, when she had told him that she was traveling to Vietnam for a one-year \"hiatus\" of sorts. Now, the memory of which he dreamed was of the occasion of Maries 18th birthday, some months before she had informed him of her imminent departure. There had been food and gifts from their few friends in the community and, despite the national legal drinking age of 21, Marie was invited by her parents to sample one of the traditional medicinal liquors or Ruou Thuocs of their native village, specifically a distilled rice whiskey of 100 proof in which had soaked a section of beef bone.Also that night, despite her parents usual diligence, things between Joseph Clayton and Marie had become rather... heated. Just as the dream began to verge into the more pleasurable parts of the experience, a sound woke him quite suddenly. The noise, a sort of odd, whooshing crack...Gunfire?!Leaping out of his bed in a panic, Joseph landed face first in very nearly the same place where he had sat last night at dinner. Finally looking up after peeling his cheek off the floor, he saw that with the exception of himself and the normal women of the household (namely Marie, her Aunt and paternal Grandmother), the house was now empty. He had landed in the central depression which housed the table, seating mats and hearth and that was surrounded by the raised platforms where the party and those inhabiting the house had bedded down last night. \"What is that?!\" Asked Joseph as another volley of cracks sounded, now followed audibly by a command to reload.Although the question was general, the response he got was specific. \"If you mean the gunshots, those are the men doing some target practice.\" Marie replied as she made to spoon some broth into a bronze bowl.\"Strange, those guys who brought us in didnt look like the type to actually use guns, what with the whole \"barbarian\" vibe they were giving off.\" Joseph sat properly at his seat as his girlfriend brought him what turned out to be soup of the kind that she usually favored as an appetizer. After thanking her, he began eating.\"Trust me, the hunters and warriors dont even like to look at firearms; they think theyre a demeaning farce of a weapon, farmers weapons as they call them... but given that theyre used by the farming men, its a pretty accurate description.\" Ladling soup into her own bowl, she sat down beside Joseph at the table.As the two older women looked on from their own work, the small talk went on between the two young ones: it turned out that these guns were old French repeating rifles from the 1920s rather than a modern Kalashnikov derivative and used an obscure 8mm cartridge that had to be produced by their agents in Vinh.Then Joseph noticed something else. \"You know, I just noticed something about your teeth... theyre white.\"\"Of course they are. I know it may be a bit hard to find toothpaste out here but...\" It was then that Marie caught on to what he had meant. \"Oh, I guess you want to know why I havent dyed them black yet, huh?\" After Joseph nodded, Marie laid out, at the most basic level, what she wanted to take away from this trip. \"Well, Ive accepted lots of conditions for this visit. I did the tattooing, I help in the rice paddies, Ive gone without modern clothing in almost every fashion, but these babies...\" She paused, did a tooth-bearing rictus grin and tapped her incisors with her right index fingernail three times. \"Ive worked far too long for this shade and Im not going to sacrifice them just so I can chew Betel nuts as a stimulant. Luckily, Dao managed to wrangle a small coffee supply from the Party minders; for a head priest hes not too bad, especially at this time of the morning.\"Somehow, Joseph suspected that this refusal had less to do with cosmetic concerns and more to do with her determination to not turn into a clone of her mother (in all of her paranoid glory) but something else caught his attention. \"What time is it, exactly? And where is everyone?\" Joseph asked in between bites. Everyone (including his party and Maries family members) had bedded down last night when the night grew dark and they had run out of things to do to stave off exhaustion. That they werent here now...Marie had an air of subtle amusement about her, possessed since untying Joseph last night. \"We dont really keep time as an exact science around here. We have morning, evening, dawn, dusk, a rough idea of mid-day... and not much else. Even the passing of the seasons tends to become a blur in the constant raining and mist; without a calendar, time can play tricks on a person up here.\"Her boyfriend did not exactly believe this. \"You dont have any clocks? I mean... National Geographic even had to edit an alarm clock out of one of their photos in order to make an African hut look primitive enough!\"Having never heard of this before, Marie could only shake her head in a form of self-depreciating humor. \"Its like I said once: this place is very rural and has historically been very isolated; it used to take years for news to filter up here from the coast. As to your other question, although Im unaware of the exact local time, your friends left the house about an hour ago.\" At this news, Joseph made a move to get up and join his friends (luckily, he had slept in his clothes) but was quickly (and effectively) shoved back down into his seat and told to finish his soup.According to Marie, the kids had gone up onto the northern terraces with Tracy to show her the rice paddies (as she was ostensibly a farmer like they) while Albert had gone to retrieve their electronic equipment from the watermill where a small water-powered electric generator had been installed by the Border Defense force just a few years before. As to the Prof and his assistant... apparently, thered been a meeting between some of the village bigwigs last night after the negotiations in the temple and Andover wanted to make sure that all the bad blood, anger and other annoyances had been cleared up before fieldwork was to commence.As a small aside however, Marie did note that the powder of the Blue Forest Lotus did seem to have a slight lingering effect on those... yet unaccustomed to the strangeness that was apparently all too common in the world. Since Andover, Malone, Tracy and Albert had come from experiences where the paranormal was slightly less para-, they had arisen early, eaten and left without any signs of sloth.After they finished eating, they returned their bowls to the hearth, thanked the two women and then left to join Josephs fellows who were set to gather in the temple for a meeting with Tsan Pho Dao himself.The way that they had left while holding hands, however, told Maries aunt and grandmother that the village matchmaker might be about to encounter another problem regarding Marie... or at the very least, the root of her current problems involving Marie.Approximately 20 Minutes LaterAs two acolytes opened the great double doors of the temple from the inside, Joseph could only gape in awe at the sights before him. The transition from the world outside with its bright sunlight and high humidity to the world of faintly lit darkness and incense smoke that contained itself within the temple of Spoonbill Village was.. almost magical. Given what he had already heard of, this might not just be a laymans impression.The interior of the temple also gave the impression of a sort of duality: on one hand, this building was probably the safest place in the village. On the other hand, the very atmosphere exuded by their surroundings, with acolytes working at mysterious duties before the various shrines of dark stone that lined the walls, indicated to any visitor that they just may not leave this building alive, an indication only strengthened by a large block of dark stone at the rear third of the interior. The sides of this almost altar-esqe block of Jadeite were engraved with many characters which appeared to be a bizarre mixture of Khoa Dau (the old script of Vietnam), the curving loops of Javanese and something even odder and older, resembling some of Alberts research on the old Seal Scripts of the Zhou... but not quite. The top of the block was formed into a shallow basin with notches for something of a liquid nature to run down into a series of channels (and from the look of it, recently had). The basin was large enough to hold a buffalo of considerable size and probably had many times over the years.According to what Marie had told him, it could also hold an adult Human male.Before the stone was low table on which was spread a yellow silken cloth. Upon the cloth, several strange items in ivory, jade, various metals and wood were placed, all seemingly used for the purpose of divining. However, what was most interesting about the table were the figures which were sitting behind it.The first and more distinctive figure was that of an old man in an ornate gold headdress and voluminous red robes. While allegedly in his early 70s and not nearly as old as some people he had met, Joseph could see that something had wizened his features to the point where he appeared decades older than he should. What hair could be seen was wispy and white, being contained mostly in a braided beard and a mustache that looked like it might have belonged on Fu Manchu if said character had survived to the age of 126. The mans eyes, however, were clear and bright, and his face held signs of amusement under the formal grimace; Later, Joseph would identify said amusement as the product of the old, sing-song adage of \"I Know Something You Dont Know\".But not yet.Professor Andover, at the head of the party that included his students and Marie, led them to a point just before the low table and motioned them to kneel and bow. When they all knelt, Andover finally spoke in the most reverent tone that Joseph had ever heard applied to this or any other form of Mon-Khmer. \"In the spirit of respect and friendship I greet you, Tsan Pho Dao, Oracle of the Jade Bones, Sage of the Blood and Master of the Way of Leng.\"Seemingly placated by the proper formal greeting, Tsan Pho Dao answered back.. but not in the way that everyone was expecting him to.\"And in the spirit of Peace and Hospitality I greet you, Professor Neville Andover of Miskatonic University.\" Replied the Chief Priest... in perfect, unaccented English. As a few heads raised and eyes gazed at him in surprise, the Priest shrugged and offered an explanation. \"A Language Acquisition Spell: sacrifice a pig and the world opens up to you. Now, I believe that you were to explain the purpose of this visit, were you not?\"Recovering remarkably well, Neville Andover explained exactly what he wanted to come out of this short, hopefully first survey. As the professor laid out the intricacies of the ethnographic process including both \"emic\" and \"etic\" (subject and researcher-derived, respectively) observations of daily life and material culture, interviews, historical research and recording of various events, Joseph slowly became aware of something. The first thing he noticed was that Maries left hand, still held and being held by his right hand as they sat next to each other, was exerting a steady pressure that was much increased from when they were walking toward the temple or entering it. He also found that she was looking sideways towards the second figure near the altar stone,This figure was a woman, somewhere between 60 and 70 years of age and rather less weathered than the man she sat beside and slightly to the rear of, her facial tattoos an asymmetric collection of delicate swirls and tiny trapezoids. Dressed in a fine formal gown of red and dark blue silk with gold filigree, she wore many sorts of jewelry from combs in her gray hair to bracelets of jade and gold on her wrists and even pendants and beads dangling from the ends of the jade hairpins that seemed to be ubiquitous in the hairstyles of married women in this village. Whereas this woman wore an expression of serene indifference, the look what Marie was giving her could easily be described as \"stink-eye\". While Joseph had been privy to a very mild version of this expression when he had almost implied cannibalism on the menu of her parents restaurant, the last time he had witnessed the full force of such a look was when they were in the fifth grade and a classmate had the gall to insult her parents tattoos.\"And Albert Noyes.. you know of the Whisperers? The mushrooms of Yuggoth?\" Tsan Pho Dao asked, examining the oracular bauble on the table which apparently indicated Noyes background. Josephs attention was brought back to the conversation by this question and the affirmative answer from Albert. \"Tell me then...\" Asked Dao. \"Have you encountered the Bringer of Strange Joy?\"\"Not face to face and neither have any others in my town. Ive heard of it... but almost as a legend across space and dimensions.\" Albert shrugged. \"I still dont understand what it really is.\"\"Nobody ever truly does.\" Dao replied sagely before moving onto the next token. Upon picking up and examining a piece of carved buffalo horn, his eyes flickered to Ms. Williams. \"It seems that you share something with our people, Ms. Williams. The bones indicate that you have participated in the rites of sacrifice, much as we do?\"\"Yes, but like Ive said before, weve only ever sacrificed our own livestock. I once helped to hold down a pig, alright but... I dont know, we never wanted to kill people and we never needed to. Some of the other groups we keep running into, though...\" Tracy sighed after she realized that she had almost began rambling. \"We try so hard to keep all of the weirdos in line year after year... and year after year its always the same: some crazy bastard tries to sneak in a human sacrifice, we get pissed and threaten to call the cops, they try to blackmail us into allowing it and then the saner worshipers just take the intended victim back where they came from, none the wiser on where they were. I just worry that someday, something horrible will happen on our doorstep and that well be blamed while the assholes slink off into the woods.\" She then looked up at the Chief Sorcerer in embarrassment. \"Im sorry that you had to hear that.. and sorry about the \"crazy bastard\" crack. Im sure youre a very nice person.\"Affecting a look of near-pity, Tsan Pho Dao offered a little of what he had seen in her future. \"The stress of such a life can be hard to bear... but I sense that help has already held out a hand. All that remains is for someone to be brave enough to accept it.\" As Tracy thought this bit of fortune-cookie wisdom over, the priest turned his head towards Joseph, who opened his mouth to speak. However, Dao held up two claw-like fingers to stop him. \"We know of you, Joseph Clayton and as of yet, nothing much outside the norm have you gazed. However, I would appreciate hearing the reasons on why you ceased playing your sport when you ventured away from home.\"Already prepared for such clarity of soothsaying, the young man shrugged. \"It turns out that I wasnt tall enough to play college basketball. However, even if I had been.. I dont I would have been content to play for a team which called itself the, and I quote, Mommas Boys.\" Albert groaned in embarrassment at the name while Tracy found reason to snicker, both knowing that the Miskatonic \"MBs\" were a long-time running punchline for the college leagues.With that interlude over, assignments were made. Tracy, coming from farm country, would stay with Maries Grandparents, conduct interviews among the farmers and record their daily lives, up to and including working alongside them on the terraced rice paddies. Albert, displaying more aptitude with technology due to his communities alliance with the so-called \"Migo\", would be stationed at the household of the Village Bronze-caster, who supplied many of the tools and utensils of the village. As they were also one of the most socially connected families in the village, the large house they inhabited would make an ideal central base for the expedition.Malone, as he had existing skills and reputedly the strongest stomach, would cover the operation of the Temple and thus be overseen by Professor Andover, who would be staying there as well. As for Joseph... for Joseph, it was decided, quite surprisingly, that he would live in the house of the hunters that had encountered the party.As the guests rose and began filing out, Tsan Pho Dao watched the retreating figures intently until the door closed behind them. He turned to the woman sitting beside him. \"Well, that certainly explains why the girl has rebuffed all of the potential suitors you pushed her way.\"The womans mask of indifference gave way to shock and then the stirrings of anger. \"You mean... him?! Are you saying that she, of her own accord, chose some foreign devil instead of one of her own kind?\"\"I wouldnt be that harsh on the boy. Hes appears not of the same fragile, treacherous mindset as the others we have encountered... if his having come this far without screaming is any indication.\" Since this morning, Dao had know that something like this was coming; his wife was comfortable in both her power and her confidence in her decisions and a conflict was bound to happen given the way Thuch and Thanh had raised their daughter in the West.\"You know what I mean! It was bad enough that her parents gave her a French name and now shes been consorting with one of them as well!\"Dao sardonically smiled. \"Im fairly sure that the boy is English; they and the French have the kind of mutual dislike for each other that we and the Han do. As to the boy himself, Ive put him far away from where Marie is staying, but she still will have to act as an interpreter for the group.\" He picked up a small, silvery disc from the table and began to examine it. \"But given her confidence in him, I feel that we should observe what happens before making any moves.\"The woman, known now only by her title of Matchmaker and by a few in her past by the name of Chau, looked at her husband in an appraising way. \"You know something, dont you?\"Still gazing at the disc that had told him something of the Clayton boy, a Unites States quarter-dollar coin circa 1961, Dao chose his words carefully. \"What I know is dwarfed by what I suspect. But... what I do know is that there is something about this boy... something that you may have to take into consideration. The threads of his fate show that something is about to pull at them... but whether for good or ill or who will pull, I do not know.\"He did not know but, as his gaze lifted from the coin (specifically a series of scratches upon the face of Washington) towards a winding pattern of black fretwork above the main door, he suspected that whatever may be coming toward the boy would be very familiar indeed.Spoonbill Village, Early AfternoonJune 30, 2011.As part of his integration into the community, Joseph had acquiesced into wearing the local clothing: a kilt and short sleeved jacket in brown cotton with geometric patterns of black lines and dots.However, there was one piece of clothing that the young man was already beginning to miss.\"You mean everyone goes commando around here? Couldnt I have at least kept my boxers on?\" Having never dressed this way outside his regular use of towel or robe for showering, Joseph was having a bit of trouble getting used to it.\"Yes we do and no, you cant have your shorts back; those things absolutely stunk! Heavens know what was going on in there.\" As they made their way from her grandparents house to their destination, materials and devices at hand, they were drawing a fair amount of stares from people going about their business, most of them absolutely bewildered by the conversation that was going on. However, Joseph could have imagined that in that last statement there was some... not amusement, although Maries tone since he had gotten his head off the metaphorical chopping block indicated that she was much more at ease in this place than he was. But there had been a hint of suggestion, a certain playfulness of tone that suggested that she knew full well some of the things which had gone on in those shorts.And then he connected the \"going commando\" remark with... Oh dear. \"And you..?\" Joseph began, quite unsure on how to word the question.\"Ive kept that part of my dignity, thank you very much.\" There was a sense of arrogance and snootiness in Maries reply, but it was a false arrogance and a playful, imitation snootiness at heart. \"Alright, so I cheated a bit but there are things I want to hang onto, even if leaving here becomes... difficult.\" They stopped in front of a house near the entrance to the village temple.\"Anything I should know about this guy?\" Joseph asked his girlfriend, desperate to get his mind out of the gutter.\"First, hes a hunter, archer and scout. Hes from the Clan of the Spider, which is one of the really old warrior lineages in this village. Second, hes also got a wife who came from a village in Laos, a Tai speaker, so there may be a language barrier. They have a son in the age range of my younger cousins. Third... well, many of the warriors do a little sorcery on the side. The odd... mutation occasionally pops up.\" There was again an awkwardness, as she was apparently describing another bit of weirdness that had slipped past the descriptions of last night.Absorbing this new description and momentarily deciding that his libido was a somewhat more comfortable avenue, Joseph mustered courage and.. well, kissed Marie again. \"I love you and... and I promise that if this goes bad, Ill make sure you get out of here.\" This statement was supposed to be one of affirmation but the worry also showed through.Momentarily flustered by her boyfriends brashness, Marie nevertheless recovered quickly. \"Hey, if things go bad, Ill be the one dragging you out of here...\" Here, her tone turned softer, more grateful and more genuine. \"But thanks all the same.\" Everything said, that kind of commitment was nice to have reinforced, even if it did point to some creeping uneasiness with the whole thing.Still, it was only the second day.As she went up to the door, Joseph thought that it was probably a good thing that he would not be able to watch her leave... and it was probably also a good thing that neither the mens nor the womens kilts were very snug.If he wasnt careful, this was going to turn into a very embarrassing few weeks."]}

Cthulhus other servants, however, were more vulnerable. Human cultists could be easily killed, and the amphibious Deep Ones, though hardier than men, were only flesh and blood. Man soon learned, however, that such small victories brought attention and terrible reprisal, so much so that humanity finally ceased to fight, struggling to simply survive beneath the feet of a race that barely even noticed their very existence.In truth, Cthulhu was not malevolent, simply amoral, beyond human concerns and desires. He neither desired nor caused most of the devastation wrecked upon humanity by the Rise of Rlyeh. Had he control over Rlyehs rising and falling, it would never have sunken to begin with. The sidereal clockworks governed Rlyeh and its inhabitants. When the stars were wrong they had to sleep, when the stars were right, they wee free to walk and fly and crawl. It was that simple. Humanity had suffered the simple misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, nothing more. Those that fought Great Cthulhu and his kin were minor irritants at best, his worshipers, useful beasts, of a little more import than Shoggoths, and a little less than The Brood of Dagon. The rest, simply another breed of animal that had flourished during his long sleep. Insignificant creatures which could be used to further his grand designs. Bizarrely, despite this view of humanity, Great Cthulhu had several children by human, or once human, mates, via some of his more humanoid avatars, of course. The children of these unions were known as Half-Bloods.This was fortunate, in many ways, for mankind. Great Cthulhu and his minions saw humans as useful pawns, if they saw them at all, so mankind was able to regroup into a primitive society, surviving under the radar. The Star Spawn rarely noticed the affairs of men, but the Half-Bloods did. The Half-Bloods, more often than not, hated their human side, feeling the need to be excessively cruel and brutal toward the people whose blood they so despised within their own veins. Some, however, were kindly disposed toward mankind...Torren-Wraeth was the son of an avatar of Great Cthulhu and Teree, an outcast woman of the Rapa Nui people, born on the island of the same name, which the Europeans would later re-name Easter Island. In form and mind he took more after his mothers people than his fathers. In many ways, he was attractive, even beautiful by human standards, though his striking Polynesian features and lithe swimmers build were offset by a eight small tendrils, three on each side of his lower jaw and two on his chin, his skin was emerald green rather than his mothers warm brown, his almond eyes yellow and cat-like, and slender, bat-like wings that spread from his shoulders. His straight black hair hung long and loose around his pointed ears, though occasionally he would braid it, for special occasions.He did not hate his human side, rather, he embraced it. His name, given by his father, loosely translated as Spirit of the Raging Waters, but his personality was far different, though his mothers people were fierce warriors and his fathers, cold, calculating and unfeeling, Torren-Wraeth was gentle. He befriended humans, or tried to, both before and after the Rise of Rlyeh. Teree still lived, she had been transformed into something more than human, but less than Star-Spawn, another of his fathers many concubines.As a Half-Blood Torren-Wraeth possessed abilities his True-Blood brethren lacked, while they could only communicate with human minds in sleep, Torren-Wraeth could communicate mentally with humans sleeping or awake, and, unlike his kin, he possessed vocal chords capable of actual human conversation. This, combined with his attractive appearance and gentle manner, made him a frequent messenger between his father and the humans who worshiped him. The Elder Sign, bane of his father and those like him, even other Half-Bloods, held no power over Torren-Wraeth. He did not know if this was a sign of favor from the Elder Gods whod crafted that mystical defense, or due to some innate part of his human nature.Rapa Nui... The people had all but died out long before the rise of Rlyeh, a combination of factors had led to their demise, systematic deforestation, a genocidal internecine war, followed by starvation. The final nail in the coffin of the Rapa Nui was the arrival of the Europeans in 1722, who brought with them disease, mistreatment and slavery. Torren-Wraeth had wanted to help them, even though they had rejected his mother, rejected him... He had implored his father to intervene, but to no avail. They were not servants of Cthulhu... Torren-Wraeth had never truly forgiven his father...The island itself, with its famous Moai statues, now rested in a low valley on the Southwestern portion of Rlyeh, if such directions could be applied to the non-euclidean, extra-dimensional hyper-geometry of the dark city. Its few inhabitants, mostly descended of mixed Rapa Nui and European blood, now lived literally in the shadows of Rlyeh . Torren-Wraeth visited often, protecting his mothers people. He erected again the fallen Moai, many toppled by the Rapa Nui themselves during and after their horrific civil war, moving tons of stone with his bare hands. It was important to him, so much human blood, sweat and tears had gone into the making of the Moai, they symbolized the pride of a people, his people.Torren-Wraeth flapped his leathery wings lazily, mainly gliding along the strong winds that whipped through the black city whose structures loomed higher than the eye could see. Occasionally one of his massive half-siblings would glide by, surprisingly graceful for their incredible size, or stare impassively out from the portals of their stone domiciles. He knew they neither loved nor hated him, they merely acknowledged his existence even as they acknowledged their own. A cold, unfeeling people, the Cthuli, H.G. Wells description of his Martian Minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic aptly fit the Star Spawn . Far below him, Torren-Wraeth could see the slithering shapes of near-mindless Shoggoths, and he strained to see if, by chance, a Deep One, a Gyo-Jin, as his dearest friend had called them, lurked below. At least they had some feelings akin to those of humanity. He saw none. He was utterly alone in a city of millions.Then the loneliness, the aching struck at his heart. Japan was gone, destroyed in the tectonic cataclysm of The Arising. Though Rapa Nui was his birthplace, his heart had been in Japan. Many years ago, his father had sent him to that land to forge an alliance with the Emperor. The alliance had been refused, but while in Japan he had met Goro. Goro had been assigned as his personal servant during his stay, and the two had become fast-friends, once the seemingly insurmountable barriers of class were broken. He had healed Goros troubled mind, entering his dreams, soothing his nightmares. Goro had lived a life of suffering and loss, and his nights were filled with terrible nightmares and even more terrible realities, something that touched Torren-Wraeths heart. For the first time, he truly felt human suffering, he truly understood that side of himself, all the hopes and fears and pains... Such pain...When he left Japan, he took Goro with him. They traveled the world for over 200 years, Torren-Wraeth drawing on his fathers power to keep Goro young and healthy. They truly cared for each other, like brothers born. Torren-Wraeth even allowed Goro to call him Torren-kun, no one, other than his mother, could have referred to Torren-Wraeth like that. But Goro was different... He would even have accepted Torren-chan, though Goro never could shake off his shackles of low-self esteem to be so familiar with the son of Kami... Hed never truly understood, Torren-Wraeth needed Goro far more than Goro needed him. Goro made him feel... Human...Hed truly loved him, not in the way of ... Shonen-Ai, was it called? Even if Torren-Wraeth had been so inclined, Goro had already suffered far too much of that kind of love. It was difficult for Torren-Wraeth to describe in the terms of either of his parents tongues, a blending of souls, perhaps? He was a companion, a friend to whom he could open up his innermost heart without fear, and he strove to repay such care in kind. But time takes its toll, and Goro simply began to lose interest in this life, he yearned to be reunited with his long-dead family, and, finally, Torren-Wraeth let him go. He visited him often, watching in his ageless agony as Goro raised a family, grew old, and finally died. Death, even Half-Bloods had little concept of death, such loss was unknown to his fathers people. He had experienced loss for the first time in his young life, and this foreign agony crushed him. The pain he felt had never truly gone away, it had left a gaping hole in his soul... A void as deep and dark as the gulf between worlds. He had wept and raged and screamed to the heavens, angry at himself for letting Goro die, angry at Goro for wanting to live as a normal man, for wanting to die. But he came to accept that forcing immortality upon Goro would have been cruel, forcing him to live a life he no longer wanted just for his own sake would have been selfish. He had finally come to peace with himself,but God, did he miss him...Goros descendants were safe, though, even if Japan was gone, Torren-Wraeth had saved them, guiding them for decades, preparing them the best he could. He finally took them to the relative safety of Canada as the end became certain, gave them the signs and words to ward off any of his kin who might do them harm. It was the best he could do, under the circumstances.The jumbled spires of Rlyeh fell away, opening onto a gloomy sea. He shook his head to clear his thoughts. Africa lay ahead, just a short jaunt on his powerful wings. The survival of Africa was almost as miraculous as the survival of Australia (which was directly adjacent to Ryleh), buffeted by tsunamis and earthquakes, rent and torn almost beyond recognition, but still there.He turned to look back, and the greenish-black stone of Rlyeh blocked his view for as far as he could see, blotting out horizon and sky with its incredible bulk. It was unnatural, in more ways than one, Rlyeh was less a continent than a great, graven image to Great Cthulhu and to his god, Yog-Sothoth, The Key and The Gate. Torren-Wraeth knew that, someday, Rlyeh would simply fade away from its earthly presence and re-appear on some other, more desirable world. They were, after all, only temporary residents on this planet, Rlyeh was little more than a great city-engine to leech all it could from earth before leaving for greener pastures in an endless, soulless cycle of domination and devastation. He hoped silently that humanity would live to see that day when Great Cthulhu and his hordes left their world forever. He often wondered, if, when that day came, he would go with them...But he knew the answer to that. He would go. He had to go. The humans had a saying, at least before the Great Arising \"Hell is other people\", but they were wrong, oh so wrong. Hell is being alone...", "A smile lit Goros dark face. He looked down at the elegant dark blue kimono in his arms. \"Its beautiful.\" Torren-Wraeth smiled in return, he loved to see Goro smile. \"It belongs to you, Goro-chan.\" \"But, this is too...\" \"You deserve it far more than any pampered noble.\" The dark-skinned youth blushed. \"Thank you, Torren-kun!\" As Goro dressed, Torren-Wraeth looked at his own kimono, bright red and fashionable. He had worried about attracting undue attention with the appearance of wealth, but he decided that he was strong enough to risk any human robber or thief. Besides, this was to be their first trip to the Kabuki theater. It had taken enough time and effort to make himself appear human, he might as well show off. He looked up at Goro, partly dressed and excitedly pulling himself together. He thought of the men who had abused him, and felt a twitch of rage... Goro must never find out what Torren-Wraeth had done to those men. He did not want Goro to ever even hear the name YGolonac, much less learn what he was, how he dealt with his victims. Torren-Wraeth loathed YGolonac, the Defiler, the Obscenity, the obese, headless god of depravity, who devoured his victims slowly with the mouths in the palms of his flabby, groping hands. But he had to avenge Goro, he had to make them pay for using him, for torturing him, for robbing him of his childhood and his innocence. Only YGolonac could grant the punishment those men deserved... Then Goro was standing there, smiling, in his blue kimono, and Torren-Wraeth was happy again...Torren-Wraeth awoke slowly, not wanting to leave his dream, because Goro still lived in his dreams... He was in China, not Japan, in the Monastery of The Order of The Bloated Woman. Japan was gone, Goro was gone, and Torren-Wraeth was still here. Warm tears ran down his cheeks, but he brushed them away. Life had to go on, and on, and on...Great Cthulhu was concerned. Hastur seemed to have gained some favor in Nyarlathoteps many eyes, and anything that benefited Hastur weakened Cthulhu, in both their eyes. \"My Lord Cthulhu, there is no need for concern,\" The tall, red-robed figure that stood at the side of Cthulhus throne moved forward respectfully, Chxixsas bone-white face seemed to swim within his voluminous robes, \"It is well known that the fruits of Nyarlathoteps attentions are rarely to be desired.\" The voice was thin, hollow, distant, \" This may prove, in fact, a setback for The King in Tatters. Even now he trembles in his palace at Carcosa, fearing what manner of spawn this union may unleash.\" Cthulhu gave the equivalent of a laugh, \"Can you picture them, The Black Wind knocking down the walls of Carcosa, the Bloody Tongue crushing that cursed palace into dust! Oh, one can dream, Chxixsas... One can dream...\"The two masks, the Golden Angel and the Slender Maiden stood side by side, Isnt it all a lie, in the end? Torren-Wraeth bowed politely before the Bloated Woman. She was holding the Black Fan under her eyes, giving the illusion that she was a slender young lady, at least to the humans present. Ho Fong stood by reverently, but his jealousy of Tek was as strong as ever. Torren-Wraeth wondered if The Bloated Woman would play them against each other...He hoped not, for both their sakes. \"It is an honor to again have the presence of the Son of Cthulhu in my humble monastery.\" \"The honor is all mine,\" Torren-Wraeth replied softly, \"My father sends his greetings and good-will toward you, My Lady.\" The Bloated Womans nose-tendril curled delicately in the air, \"No doubt. Send him my good-will in return.\" Torren-Wraeth couldnt help but look at the sacrificial altar, where human victims had their arms cut off by the sacred sickles, after which they bled to death. He shuddered slightly at the horrible images flashing through his mind. The Bloated Woman noted this, but politely made no mention of it. Torren-Wraeth honestly could not condemn her, almost all of the worshiped entities, including his own father, demanded human sacrifice, many in even more horrible ways... \"I regret that I have to leave so soon, though I am grateful for your hospitality.\" The last part, at least, was true. \"May The Key and The Gate be with you.\""]}

A Result and a Prologue1.From a private hospital for the insane near Providence, Rhode Island, there recently disappeared an exceedingly singular person. He bore the name of Charles Dexter Ward, and was placed under restraint most reluctantly by the grieving father who had watched his aberration grow from a mere eccentricity to a dark mania involving both a possibility of murderous tendencies and a profound and peculiar change in the apparent contents of his mind. Doctors confess themselves quite baffled by his case, since it presented oddities of a general physiological as well as psychological character.      In the first place, the patient seemed oddly older than his twenty-six years would warrant. Mental disturbance, it is true, will age one rapidly; but the face of this young man had taken on a subtle cast which only the very aged normally acquire. In the second place, his organic processes shewed a certain queerness of proportion which nothing in medical experience can parallel. Respiration and heart action had a baffling lack of symmetry; the voice was lost, so that no sounds above a whisper were possible; digestion was incredibly prolonged and minimised, and neural reactions to standard stimuli bore no relation at all to anything heretofore recorded, either normal or pathological. The skin had a morbid chill and dryness, and the cellular structure of the tissue seemed exaggeratedly coarse and loosely knit. Even a large olive birthmark on the right hip had disappeared, whilst there had formed on the chest a very peculiar mole or blackish spot of which no trace existed before. In general, all physicians agree that in Ward the processes of metabolism had become retarded to a degree beyond precedent.      Psychologically, too, Charles Ward was unique. His madness held no affinity to any sort recorded in even the latest and most exhaustive of treatises, and was conjoined to a mental force which would have made him a genius or a leader had it not been twisted into strange and grotesque forms. Dr. Willett, who was Wards family physician, affirms that the patients gross mental capacity, as gauged by his response to matters outside the sphere of his insanity, had actually increased since the seizure. Ward, it is true, was always a scholar and an antiquarian; but even his most brilliant early work did not shew the prodigious grasp and insight displayed during his last examinations by the alienists. It was, indeed, a difficult matter to obtain a legal commitment to the hospital, so powerful and lucid did the youths mind seem; and only on the evidence of others, and on the strength of many abnormal gaps in his stock of information as distinguished from his intelligence, was he finally placed in confinement. To the very moment of his vanishment he was an omnivorous reader and as great a conversationalist as his poor voice permitted; and shrewd observers, failing to foresee his escape, freely predicted that he would not be long in gaining his discharge from custody.      Only Dr. Willett, who brought Charles Ward into the world and had watched his growth of body and mind ever since, seemed frightened at the thought of his future freedom. He had had a terrible experience and had made a terrible discovery which he dared not reveal to his sceptical colleagues. Willett, indeed, presents a minor mystery all his own in his connexion with the case. He was the last to see the patient before his flight, and emerged from that final conversation in a state of mixed horror and relief which several recalled when Wards escape became known three hours later. That escape itself is one of the unsolved wonders of Dr. Waites hospital. A window open above a sheer drop of sixty feet could hardly explain it, yet after that talk with Willett the youth was undeniably gone. Willett himself has no public explanations to offer, though he seems strangely easier in mind than before the escape. Many, indeed, feel that he would like to say more if he thought any considerable number would believe him. He had found Ward in his room, but shortly after his departure the attendants knocked in vain. When they opened the door the patient was not there, and all they found was the open window with a chill April breeze blowing in a cloud of fine bluish-grey dust that almost choked them. True, the dogs howled some time before; but that was while Willett was still present, and they had caught nothing and shewn no disturbance later on. Wards father was told at once over the telephone, but he seemed more saddened than surprised. By the time Dr. Waite called in person, Dr. Willett had been talking with him, and both disavowed any knowledge or complicity in the escape. Only from certain closely confidential friends of Willett and the senior Ward have any clues been gained, and even these are too wildly fantastic for general credence. The one fact which remains is that up to the present time no trace of the missing madman has been unearthed.      Charles Ward was an antiquarian from infancy, no doubt gaining his taste from the venerable town around him, and from the relics of the past which filled every corner of his parents old mansion in Prospect Street on the crest of the hill. With the years his devotion to ancient things increased; so that history, genealogy, and the study of colonial architecture, furniture, and craftsmanship at length crowded everything else from his sphere of interests. These tastes are important to remember in considering his madness; for although they do not form its absolute nucleus, they play a prominent part in its superficial form. The gaps of information which the alienists noticed were all related to modern matters, and were invariably offset by a correspondingly excessive though outwardly concealed knowledge of bygone matters as brought out by adroit questioning; so that one would have fancied the patient literally transferred to a former age through some obscure sort of auto-hypnosis. The odd thing was that Ward seemed no longer interested in the antiquities he knew so well. He had, it appears, lost his regard for them through sheer familiarity; and all his final efforts were obviously bent toward mastering those common facts of the modern world which had been so totally and unmistakably expunged from his brain. That this wholesale deletion had occurred, he did his best to hide; but it was clear to all who watched him that his whole programme of reading and conversation was determined by a frantic wish to imbibe such knowledge of his own life and of the ordinary practical and cultural background of the twentieth century as ought to have been his by virtue of his birth in 1902 and his education in the schools of our own time. Alienists are now wondering how, in view of his vitally impaired range of data, the escaped patient manages to cope with the complicated world of today; the dominant opinion being that he is lying low in some humble and unexacting position till his stock of modern information can be brought up to the normal.      The beginning of Wards madness is a matter of dispute among alienists. Dr. Lyman, the eminent Boston authority, places it in 1919 or 1920, during the boys last year at the Moses Brown School, when he suddenly turned from the study of the past to the study of the occult, and refused to qualify for college on the ground that he had individual researches of much greater importance to make. This is certainly borne out by Wards altered habits at the time, especially by his continual search through town records and among old burying-grounds for a certain grave dug in 1771; the grave of an ancestor named Joseph Curwen, some of whose papers he professed to have found behind the panelling of a very old house in Olney Court, on Stampers Hill, which Curwen was known to have built and occupied. It is, broadly speaking, undeniable that the winter of 1919-20 saw a great change in Ward; whereby he abruptly stopped his general antiquarian pursuits and embarked on a desperate delving into occult subjects both at home and abroad, varied only by this strangely persistent search for his forefathers grave.      From this opinion, however, Dr. Willett substantially dissents; basing his verdict on his close and continuous knowledge of the patient, and on certain frightful investigations and discoveries which he made toward the last. Those investigations and discoveries have left their mark upon him; so that his voice trembles when he tells them, and his hand trembles when he tries to write of them. Willett admits that the change of 1919-20 would ordinarily appear to mark the beginning of a progressive decadence which culminated in the horrible and uncanny alienation of 1928; but believes from personal observation that a finer distinction must be made. Granting freely that the boy was always ill-balanced temperamentally, and prone to be unduly susceptible and enthusiastic in his responses to phenomena around him, he refuses to concede that the early alteration marked the actual passage from sanity to madness; crediting instead Wards own statement that he had discovered or rediscovered something whose effect on human thought was likely to be marvellous and profound. The true madness, he is certain, came with a later change; after the Curwen portrait and the ancient papers had been unearthed; after a trip to strange foreign places had been made, and some terrible invocations chanted under strange and secret circumstances; after certain answers to these invocations had been plainly indicated, and a frantic letter penned under agonising and inexplicable conditions; after the wave of vampirism and the ominous Pawtuxet gossip; and after the patients memory commenced to exclude contemporary images whilst his voice failed and his physical aspect underwent the subtle modification so many subsequently noticed.      It was only about this time, Willett points out with much acuteness, that the nightmare qualities became indubitably linked with Ward; and the doctor feels shudderingly sure that enough solid evidence exists to sustain the youths claim regarding his crucial discovery. In the first place, two workmen of high intelligence saw Joseph Curwens ancient papers found. Secondly, the boy once shewed Dr. Willett those papers and a page of the Curwen diary, and each of the documents had every appearance of genuineness. The hole where Ward claimed to have found them was long a visible reality, and Willett had a very convincing final glimpse of them in surroundings which can scarcely be believed and can never perhaps be proved. Then there were the mysteries and coincidences of the Orne and Hutchinson letters, and the problem of the Curwen penmanship and of what the detectives brought to light about Dr. Allen; these things, and the terrible message in mediaeval minuscules found in Willetts pocket when he gained consciousness after his shocking experience.      And most conclusive of all, there are the two hideous results which the doctor obtained from a certain pair of formulae during his final investigations; results which virtually proved the authenticity of the papers and of their monstrous implications at the same time that those papers were borne forever from human knowledge.2.      One must look back at Charles Wards earlier life as at something belonging as much to the past as the antiquities he loved so keenly. In the autumn of 1918, and with a considerable show of zest in the military training of the period, he had begun his junior year at the Moses Brown School, which lies very near his home. The old main building, erected in 1819, had always charmed his youthful antiquarian sense; and the spacious park in which the academy is set appealed to his sharp eye for landscape. His social activities were few; and his hours were spent mainly at home, in rambling walks, in his classes and drills, and in pursuit of antiquarian and genealogical data at the City Hall, the State House, the Public Library, the Athenaeum, the Historical Society, the John Carter Brown and John Hay Libraries of Brown University, and the newly opened Shepley Library in Benefit Street. One may picture him yet as he was in those days; tall, slim, and blond, with studious eyes and a slight stoop, dressed somewhat carelessly, and giving a dominant impression of harmless awkwardness rather than attractiveness.      His walks were always adventures in antiquity, during which he managed to recapture from the myriad relics of a glamorous old city a vivid and connected picture of the centuries before. His home was a great Georgian mansion atop the well-nigh precipitous hill that rises just east of the river; and from the rear windows of its rambling wings he could look dizzily out over all the clustered spires, domes, roofs, and skyscraper summits of the lower town to the purple hills of the countryside beyond. Here he was born, and from the lovely classic porch of the double-bayed brick facade his nurse had first wheeled him in his carriage; past the little white farmhouse of two hundred years before that the town had long ago overtaken, and on toward the stately colleges along the shady, sumptuous street, whose old square brick mansions and smaller wooden houses with narrow, heavy-columned Doric porches dreamed solid and exclusive amidst their generous yards and gardens.      He had been wheeled, too, along sleepy Congdon Street, one tier lower down on the steep hill, and with all its eastern homes on high terraces. The small wooden houses averaged a greater age here, for it was up this hill that the growing town had climbed; and in these rides he had imbibed something of the colour of a quaint colonial village. The nurse used to stop and sit on the benches of Prospect Terrace to chat with policemen; and one of the childs first memories was of the great westward sea of hazy roofs and domes and steeples and far hills which he saw one winter afternoon from that great railed embankment, all violet and mystic against a fevered, apocalyptic sunset of reds and golds and purples and curious greens. The vast marble dome of the State House stood out in massive silhouette, its crowning statue haloed fantastically by a break in one of the tinted stratus clouds that barred the flaming sky.      When he was larger his famous walks began; first with his impatiently dragged nurse, and then alone in dreamy meditation. Farther and farther down that almost perpendicular hill he would venture, each time reaching older and quainter levels of the ancient city. He would hesitate gingerly down vertical Jenckes Street with its bank walls and colonial gables to the shady Benefit Street corner, where before him was a wooden antique with an Ionic-pilastered pair of doorways, and beside him a prehistoric gambrel-roofer with a bit of primal farmyard remaining, and the great Judge Durfee house with its fallen vestiges of Georgian grandeur. It was getting to be a slum here; but the titan elms cast a restoring shadow over the place, and the boy used to stroll south past the long lines of the pre-Revolutionary homes with their great central chimneys and classic portals. On the eastern side they were set high over basements with railed double flights of stone steps, and the young Charles could picture them as they were when the street was new, and red heels and periwigs set off the painted pediments whose signs of wear were now becoming so visible.      Westward the hill dropped almost as steeply as above, down to the old \"Town Street\" that the founders had laid out at the rivers edge in 1636. Here ran innumerable little lanes with leaning, huddled houses of immense antiquity; and fascinated though he was, it was long before he dared to thread their archaic verticality for fear they would turn out a dream or a gateway to unknown terrors. He found it much less formidable to continue along Benefit Street past the iron fence of St. Johns hidden churchyard and the rear of the 1761 Colony House and the mouldering bulk of the Golden Ball Inn where Washington stopped. At Meeting Street - the successive Gaol Lane and King Street of other periods - he would look upward to the east and see the arched flight of steps to which the highway had to resort in climbing the slope, and downward to the west, glimpsing the old brick colonial schoolhouse that smiles across the road at the ancient Sign of Shakespears Head where the Providence Gazette and Country-Journal was printed before the Revolution. Then came the exquisite First Baptist Church of 1775, luxurious with its matchless Gibbs steeple, and the Georgian roofs and cupolas hovering by. Here and to the southward the neighbourhood became better, flowering at last into a marvellous group of early mansions; but still the little ancient lanes led off down the precipice to the west, spectral in their many-gabled archaism and dipping to a riot of iridescent decay where the wicked old waterfront recalls its proud East India days amidst polyglot vice and squalor, rotting wharves, and blear-eyed ship-chandleries, with such surviving alley names as Packet, Bullion, Gold, Silver, Coin, Doubloon, Sovereign, Guilder, Dollar, Dime, and Cent.      Sometimes, as he grew taller and more adventurous, young Ward would venture down into this maelstrom of tottering houses, broken transoms, tumbling steps, twisted balustrades, swarthy faces, and nameless odours; winding from South Main to South Water, searching out the docks where the bay and sound steamers still touched, and returning northward at this lower level past the steep-roofed 1816 warehouses and the broad square at the Great Bridge, where the 1773 Market House still stands firm on its ancient arches. In that square he would pause to drink in the bewildering beauty of the old town as it rises on its eastward bluff, decked with its two Georgian spires and crowned by the vast new Christian Science dome as London is crowned by St. Pauls. He liked mostly to reach this point in the late afternoon, when the slanting sunlight touches the Market House and the ancient hill roofs and belfries with gold, and throws magic around the dreaming wharves where Providence Indiamen used to ride at anchor. After a long look he would grow almost dizzy with a poets love for the sight, and then he would scale the slope homeward in the dusk past the old white church and up the narrow precipitous ways where yellow gleams would begin to peep out in small-paned windows and through fanlights set high over double flights of steps with curious wrought-iron railings.      At other times, and in later years, he would seek for vivid contrasts; spending half a walk in the crumbling colonial regions northwest of his home, where the hill drops to the lower eminence of Stampers Hill with its ghetto and negro quarter clustering round the place where the Boston stage coach used to start before the Revolution, and the other half in the gracious southerly realm about George, Benevolent, Power, and Williams Streets, where the old slope holds unchanged the fine estates and bits of walled garden and steep green lane in which so many fragrant memories linger. These rambles, together with the diligent studies which accompanied them, certainly account for a large amount of the antiquarian lore which at last crowded the modern world from Charles Wards mind; and illustrate the mental soil upon which fell, in that fateful winter of 1919-20, the seeds that came to such strange and terrible fruition.      Dr. Willett is certain that, up to this ill-omened winter of first change, Charles Wards antiquarianism was free from every trace of the morbid. Graveyards held for him no particular attraction beyond their quaintness and historic value, and of anything like violence or savage instinct he was utterly devoid. Then, by insidious degrees, there appeared to develop a curious sequel to one of his genealogical triumphs of the year before; when he had discovered among his maternal ancestors a certain very long-lived man named Joseph Curwen, who had come from Salem in March of 1692, and about whom a whispered series of highly peculiar and disquieting stories clustered.      Wards great-great-grandfather Welcome Potter had in 1785 married a certain \"Ann Tillinghast, daughter of Mrs. Eliza, daughter to Capt. James Tillinghast\", of whose paternity the family had preserved no trace. Late in 1918, whilst examining a volume of original town records in manuscript, the young genealogist encountered an entry describing a legal change of name, by which in 1772 a Mrs. Eliza Curwen, widow of Joseph Curwen, resumed, along with her seven-year-old daughter Ann, her maiden name of Tillinghast; on the ground that her Husbands name was become a publick Reproach by Reason of what was knowne after his Decease; the which confirming an antient common Rumour, tho not to be credited by a loyall Wife till so proven as to be wholely past Doubting. This entry came to light upon the accidental separation of two leaves which had been carefully pasted together and treated as one by a laboured revision of the page numbers.      It was at once clear to Charles Ward that he had indeed discovered a hitherto unknown great-great-great-grandfather. The discovery doubly excited him because he had already heard vague reports and seen scattered allusions relating to this person; about whom there remained so few publicly available records, aside from those becoming public only in modern times, that it almost seemed as if a conspiracy had existed to blot him from memory. What did appear, moreover, was of such a singular and provocative nature that one could not fail to imagine curiously what it was that the colonial recorders were so anxious to conceal and forget; or to suspect that the deletion had reasons all too valid.      Before this, Ward had been content to let his romancing about old Joseph Curwen remain in the idle stage; but having discovered his own relationship to this apparently \"hushed-up\" character, he proceeded to hunt out as systematically as possible whatever he might find concerning him. In this excited quest he eventually succeeded beyond his highest expectations; for old letters, diaries, and sheaves of unpublished memoirs in cobwebbed Providence garrets and elsewhere yielded many illuminating passages which their writers had not thought it worth their while to destroy. One important sidelight came from a point as remote as New York, where some Rhode Island colonial correspondence was stored in the Museum at Fraunces Tavern. The really crucial thing, though, and what in Dr. Willetts opinion formed the definite source of Wards undoing, was the matter found in August 1919 behind the panelling of the crumbling house in Olney Court. It was that, beyond a doubt, which opened up those black vistas whose end was deeper than the pit.", "X.In the end the three men from Arkham—old, white-bearded Dr. Armitage, stocky, iron-grey Professor Rice, and lean, youngish Dr. Morgan—ascended the mountain alone. After much patient instruction regarding its focussing and use, they left the telescope with the frightened group that remained in the road; and as they climbed they were watched closely by those among whom the glass was passed around. It was hard going, and Armitage had to be helped more than once. High above the toiling group the great swath trembled as its hellish maker re-passed with snail-like deliberateness. Then it was obvious that the pursuers were gaining.      Curtis Whateley—of the undecayed branch—was holding the telescope when the Arkham party detoured radically from the swath. He told the crowd that the men were evidently trying to get to a subordinate peak which overlooked the swath at a point considerably ahead of where the shrubbery was now bending. This, indeed, proved to be true; and the party were seen to gain the minor elevation only a short time after the invisible blasphemy had passed it.      Then Wesley Corey, who had taken the glass, cried out that Armitage was adjusting the sprayer which Rice held, and that something must be about to happen. The crowd stirred uneasily, recalling that this sprayer was expected to give the unseen horror a moment of visibility. Two or three men shut their eyes, but Curtis Whateley snatched back the telescope and strained his vision to the utmost. He saw that Rice, from the party’s point of vantage above and behind the entity, had an excellent chance of spreading the potent powder with marvellous effect.      Those without the telescope saw only an instant’s flash of grey cloud—a cloud about the size of a moderately large building—near the top of the mountain. Curtis, who had held the instrument, dropped it with a piercing shriek into the ankle-deep mud of the road. He reeled, and would have crumpled to the ground had not two or three others seized and steadied him. All he could do was moan half-inaudibly,      “Oh, oh, great Gawd . . . that . . . that . . .”      There was a pandemonium of questioning, and only Henry Wheeler thought to rescue the fallen telescope and wipe it clean of mud. Curtis was past all coherence, and even isolated replies were almost too much for him.      “Bigger’n a barn . . . all made o’ squirmin’ ropes . . . hull thing sort o’ shaped like a hen’s egg bigger’n anything, with dozens o’ legs like hogsheads that haff shut up when they step . . . nothin’ solid abaout it—all like jelly, an’ made o’ sep’rit wrigglin’ ropes pushed clost together . . . great bulgin’ eyes all over it . . . ten or twenty maouths or trunks a-stickin’ aout all along the sides, big as stovepipes, an’ all a-tossin’ an’ openin’ an’ shuttin’ . . . all grey, with kinder blue or purple rings . . . an’ Gawd in heaven—that haff face on top! . . .”      This final memory, whatever it was, proved too much for poor Curtis; and he collapsed completely before he could say more. Fred Farr and Will Hutchins carried him to the roadside and laid him on the damp grass. Henry Wheeler, trembling, turned the rescued telescope on the mountain to see what he might. Through the lenses were discernible three tiny figures, apparently running toward the summit as fast as the steep incline allowed. Only these—nothing more. Then everyone noticed a strangely unseasonable noise in the deep valley behind, and even in the underbrush of Sentinel Hill itself. It was the piping of unnumbered whippoorwills, and in their shrill chorus there seemed to lurk a note of tense and evil expectancy.      Earl Sawyer now took the telescope and reported the three figures as standing on the topmost ridge, virtually level with the altar-stone but at a considerable distance from it. One figure, he said, seemed to be raising its hands above its head at rhythmic intervals; and as Sawyer mentioned the circumstance the crowd seemed to hear a faint, half-musical sound from the distance, as if a loud chant were accompanying the gestures. The weird silhouette on that remote peak must have been a spectacle of infinite grotesqueness and impressiveness, but no observer was in a mood for aesthetic appreciation. “I guess he’s sayin’ the spell,” whispered Wheeler as he snatched back the telescope. The whippoorwills were piping wildly, and in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of the visible ritual.      Suddenly the sunshine seemed to lessen without the intervention of any discernible cloud. It was a very peculiar phenomenon, and was plainly marked by all. A rumbling sound seemed brewing beneath the hills, mixed strangely with a concordant rumbling which clearly came from the sky. Lightning flashed aloft, and the wondering crowd looked in vain for the portents of storm. The chanting of the men from Arkham now became unmistakable, and Wheeler saw through the glass that they were all raising their arms in the rhythmic incantation. From some farmhouse far away came the frantic barking of dogs.      The change in the quality of the daylight increased, and the crowd gazed about the horizon in wonder. A purplish darkness, born of nothing more than a spectral deepening of the sky’s blue, pressed down upon the rumbling hills. Then the lightning flashed again, somewhat brighter than before, and the crowd fancied that it had shewed a certain mistiness around the altar-stone on the distant height. No one, however, had been using the telescope at that instant. The whippoorwills continued their irregular pulsation, and the men of Dunwich braced themselves tensely against some imponderable menace with which the atmosphere seemed surcharged.      Without warning came those deep, cracked, raucous vocal sounds which will never leave the memory of the stricken group who heard them. Not from any human throat were they born, for the organs of man can yield no such acoustic perversions. Rather would one have said they came from the pit itself, had not their source been so unmistakably the altar-stone on the peak. It is almost erroneous to call them sounds at all, since so much of their ghastly, infra-bass timbre spoke to dim seats of consciousness and terror far subtler than the ear; yet one must do so, since their form was indisputably though vaguely that of half-articulate words. They were loud—loud as the rumblings and the thunder above which they echoed—yet did they come from no visible being. And because imagination might suggest a conjectural source in the world of non-visible beings, the huddled crowd at the mountain’s base huddled still closer, and winced as if in expectation of a blow.      “Ygnaiih . . . ygnaiih . . . thflthkh’ngha . . . Yog-Sothoth . . .” rang the hideous croaking out of space. “Y’bthnk . . . h’ehye—n’grkdl’lh. . . .”      The speaking impulse seemed to falter here, as if some frightful psychic struggle were going on. Henry Wheeler strained his eye at the telescope, but saw only the three grotesquely silhouetted human figures on the peak, all moving their arms furiously in strange gestures as their incantation drew near its culmination. From what black wells of Acherontic fear or feeling, from what unplumbed gulfs of extra-cosmic consciousness or obscure, long-latent heredity, were those half-articulate thunder-croakings drawn? Presently they began to gather renewed force and coherence as they grew in stark, utter, ultimate frenzy.      “Eh-ya-ya-ya-yahaah—e’yayayayaaaa . . . ngh’aaaaa . . . ngh’aaaa . . . h’yuh . . . h’yuh . . . HELP! HELP! . . . ff—ff—ff—FATHER! FATHER! YOG-SOTHOTH! . . .”      But that was all. The pallid group in the road, still reeling at the indisputably English syllables that had poured thickly and thunderously down from the frantic vacancy beside that shocking altar-stone, were never to hear such syllables again. Instead, they jumped violently at the terrific report which seemed to rend the hills; the deafening, cataclysmic peal whose source, be it inner earth or sky, no hearer was ever able to place. A single lightning-bolt shot from the purple zenith to the altar-stone, and a great tidal wave of viewless force and indescribable stench swept down from the hill to all the countryside. Trees, grass, and underbrush were whipped into a fury; and the frightened crowd at the mountain’s base, weakened by the lethal foetor that seemed about to asphyxiate them, were almost hurled off their feet. Dogs howled from the distance, green grass and foliage wilted to a curious, sickly yellow-grey, and over field and forest were scattered the bodies of dead whippoorwills.      The stench left quickly, but the vegetation never came right again. To this day there is something queer and unholy about the growths on and around that fearsome hill. Curtis Whateley was only just regaining consciousness when the Arkham men came slowly down the mountain in the beams of a sunlight once more brilliant and untainted. They were grave and quiet, and seemed shaken by memories and reflections even more terrible than those which had reduced the group of natives to a state of cowed quivering. In reply to a jumble of questions they only shook their heads and reaffirmed one vital fact.      “The thing has gone forever,” Armitage said. “It has been split up into what it was originally made of, and can never exist again. It was an impossibility in a normal world. Only the least fraction was really matter in any sense we know. It was like its father—and most of it has gone back to him in some vague realm or dimension outside our material universe; some vague abyss out of which only the most accursed rites of human blasphemy could ever have called him for a moment on the hills.”      There was a brief silence, and in that pause the scattered senses of poor Curtis Whateley began to knit back into a sort of continuity; so that he put his hands to his head with a moan. Memory seemed to pick itself up where it had left off, and the horror of the sight that had prostrated him burst in upon him again.      “Oh, oh, my Gawd, that haff face—that haff face on top of it . . . that face with the red eyes an’ crinkly albino hair, an’ no chin, like the Whateleys . . . It was a octopus, centipede, spider kind o’ thing, but they was a haff-shaped man’s face on top of it, an’ it looked like Wizard Whateley’s, only it was yards an’ yards acrost. . . .”      He paused exhausted, as the whole group of natives stared in a bewilderment not quite crystallised into fresh terror. Only old Zebulon Whateley, who wanderingly remembered ancient things but who had been silent heretofore, spoke aloud.      “Fifteen year’ gone,” he rambled, “I heerd Ol’ Whateley say as haow some day we’d hear a child o’ Lavinny’s a-callin’ its father’s name on the top o’ Sentinel Hill. . . .”      But Joe Osborn interrupted him to question the Arkham men anew.      “What was it anyhaow, an’ haowever did young Wizard Whateley call it aout o’ the air it come from?”      Armitage chose his words very carefully.      “It was—well, it was mostly a kind of force that doesn’t belong in our part of space; a kind of force that acts and grows and shapes itself by other laws than those of our sort of Nature. We have no business calling in such things from outside, and only very wicked people and very wicked cults ever try to. There was some of it in Wilbur Whateley himself—enough to make a devil and a precocious monster of him, and to make his passing out a pretty terrible sight. I’m going to burn his accursed diary, and if you men are wise you’ll dynamite that altar-stone up there, and pull down all the rings of standing stones on the other hills. Things like that brought down the beings those Whateleys were so fond of—the beings they were going to let in tangibly to wipe out the human race and drag the earth off to some nameless place for some nameless purpose.      “But as to this thing we’ve just sent back—the Whateleys raised it for a terrible part in the doings that were to come. It grew fast and big from the same reason that Wilbur grew fast and big—but it beat him because it had a greater share of the outsideness in it. You needn’t ask how Wilbur called it out of the air. He didn’t call it out. It was his twin brother, but it looked more like the father than he did.”"]}
{"id": "EN044", "pair": ["An autumnal chill descended upon the streets of Glaston as the young man walked upon the concrete sidewalk, passing redbrick storefronts and shop windows, every surface still wet with the morning rain. Leaves, red and orange and each vibrant in their hue, were shaken loose from the trees lining the street by the wind, landing wherever they fell. For an instant in time, the spectacle of the leaves drew the attention of the man, in fact little more than a teenage boy, as he made his way toward the corner. However, Joseph Clayton, clad in bluejeans and jacket with a backpack slung from his shoulders, had far more important things to focus on than a show of falling leaves. An important test for this semester was arriving in a week or so and he needed to study.Also, he was getting quite hungry this close to lunch.As Joseph rounded the corner and continued toward his favorite eatery, he wondered if he would get swamped in the usual lunch crowd. However, as he saw the front of the Leng Trinh Restaurant, his thoughts turned to quiet dejection.\"Damnit!\" muttered Joseph as he approached the eatery. The reason for this turn in mood was the carpet of tempered glass fragments on the sidewalk below the picture window at the front of the establishment, which was now covered by plastic sheeting. Thuch Van Trinh, one half of the husband-and-wife ownership, was wearing a plaid jacket over his apron and usual cooking clothes and was shoveling the broken glass into a bucket. \"Hey, Mr. Trinh, hows it going?\". Joseph asked with a smile. This was more false cheer than anything, as Joseph could guess how Thuch must be feeling: anger was always a popular choice, followed closely by worry about the reason why.Despite what he must have been feeling, Thuch Van Trinh grinned back, the black lines of his facial tattooing creasing as the muscles moved under his cheeks. \"Not so good, Mr. Clayton. If this keeps up, I may have to put in Plexiglas so that the window wont break.\" The Trinhs accents, as his parents and the other adults of the town told it, had been rather strong (even unusually so) when they had immigrated to Glaston from their first home in Boston. This had usually been waved off by their purported origins in the remote hills on the Vietnam-Laos border, seemingly collaborated by how their teeth had been dyed black. On the other hand, given their rural roots, their speed in adapting local speech patterns so that they now sounded more like second generation Americans (and especially their daughters complete lack of any accent except the local standard) did make for a puzzling situation. However, for their ease of assimilation and the food they served, they had become well-liked in the community.So why were things like this happening to them recently? \"How many times does this make this month; two, three?\" Joseph had to ask this, wondering if things were worse than he thought.\"Its happened three times already, this time not more than an hour ago. Thanh wants to install security cameras to watch the place and with how small and cheap they are now, I think we just might.\" An hour ago? Theyd smashed a picture window in broad daylight? Who in town could be that stupid or that angry? Josephs train of thought was broken then, when Thuch said something of much more interest to the younger man. \"By the way, if youre looking for Marie, shes helping her mother in the kitchen. Even without a window we seem to be doing good business.\" Thuch went back to his work and Joseph, not wanting to delay any longer, entered the restaurant.Just as Thuch had said, Leng Trinh still had its usual busy lunchtime crowd, albeit one that was concentrated near the back wall. Picking his way around tables packed with diners, Joseph finally arrived at a table set for two, a reserved sign upon it. Removing his backpack and laying it beside a chair, he sat down, shuffled off his coat and went to bury his nose in the menu.It always felt a bit odd to Joseph, eating in an ethnic restaurant where none of the diners were the same ethnicity as the cooks, or even from the same part of the world. However, none of it mattered when the food was as good as it was here.\"Now then, what would a fine, upstanding New England boy like yourself want in a place like this?\" The voice that asked this was soft, amused, female and had an almost mocking tone. It also had the accent of the New England uplands. To Joseph, it could only be one person.\"The same thing I always get here.\" He answered dryly before looking up from the menu. There, holding a pad of paper and a pen, was teenage girl with almond-shaped eyes, shoulder length black hair with green streaks, a cooking apron and an amused grin. \"Hi Marie... you sure your moms alright with you waitressing this crowd?\"\"Weve got enough help in the kitchen already and Dads coming in after all the glass is cleaned up.\" She glanced up at the window, plastic sheet and all, after she wrote his order down. \"I just wish we knew who was doing this. If we dont get someone else to cough up some money, our insurance company might go sour on us.\" Marie went back to the kitchen to get the food for both of them.Ten minutes later, she was laying out two place settings of food that had been prepared ahead of time. \"Alright, thats two plates of grilled pork on beds of Leng-style rice, your dish of steamed green beans with soy sauce for dipping, my bowl of soup and two cans of soda.\" Theyd eat lunch before studying, with Joseph paying the tab for both of them.If anyone asked, it wasnt a date. Not in the strictest sense, anyway.\"What, no bak bon dzhow?\" Asked Joseph, decidedly disappointed at the apparent lack of the special ingredient.To this, Marie moved a small earthen bowl from the serving tray onto the table and lifted the lid to reveal a thick gray sauce containing mushrooms and cracked black pepper. \"Would I be one to deny you the gravy of the gods?\" She asked (rhetorically) with a soft smile; Joseph couldnt help but smile back as he cracked the tab on his soda and began on his green beans.A bit later, when his beans were gone and Marie had almost finished her soup, Joesph began formulating a question that related to a curious thought that had sprung up earlier. \"Not to sound like a nag or anything, but Im just curious but what was all that upstanding stuff about?\" The only time he had ever heard anyone talk like that was...Oh God...Marie swallowed the last bits of her soup. \"Oh, I dont know. Maybe Its that I had no idea that the son of insurance brokers had such deep and aristocratic roots? Maybe its that I was surprised to find out that the Claytons had come not from hardy New England farming stock as I had assumed, but from the urbane, wealthy ranks of those grand Brahmins of Boston? Im sure Granny Cora could tell some fascinating stories about the old days; she sure seemed interested in mine.\" If anything, Marie took the entire thing in stride, treating both the memory of the experience and the experience itself with a a great deal of interested amusement. Certainly, mocking the type of language she had encountered was almost cracking her up.Joseph, on the other hand, had first felt bemusement at the scene in which the Clayton family reunion of the past summer had found itself, quickly turning into outright embarrassment. \"Look, Im sorry that I didnt tell you about her, but everybody thought that she wouldnt be able to come due to health concerns. Its not my fault that a half-senile, 97 year old woman worked up enough stubbornness to drag her nurse halfway across the state!\".\"I never said anything about anyone being at fault. I just thought it was an interesting revelation about your family.\" She had meant her cajoling in good humour, but Josephs defensiveness and embarrassment were never good emotions to bring out. \"Anyway, most people would be proud to have the Boston gentry in their family history: industrialists, merchants, art, culture, philanthropy, charity...\" With every word, Marie spooned a bit of ban boc dzhow onto her grilled pork.\"As well as whaling, slave trading, opium smuggling, snobbery and having your entire life guided by the expectations of your peers; exactly the sorts of things my parents taught me to loathe. The thing is, my great-great-grandmother came from a very select, very privileged and lily-white background; I was worried that shed... well, react oddly to you.\" Joseph retorted as he began spooning (or rather, pouring) the sauce onto his meat after Marie had finished with it and passed it to him. In the case of Cora Clayton (nee Coffin), Josephs fear hadnt primarily been that she would find Marie objectionable on account of her race since that prejudice had been more ingrained in her parents generation than hers. His fear had instead been that his great great grandmother, as self-proclaimed guardian of the old, aristocratic traditions, might object to their relationship because the Trinhs were restaurateurs with no history of pedigree, education or money behind them.In Coras world (the 1920s, where her mind was half the time), heirs had married heiresses, families had coordinated their fortunes and everyone had kept an eye on everyone else; these were rules of decorum that had lasted for her long after the Claytons had gone bust in the great Crash of 29. The fact that she had taken Joseph aside and explained her concerns to him had done nothing to soothe his embarrassment, although he had finally convinced her that, being naturalized citizens with a successful restaurant, the Trinhs were firmly in the middling classes. She had also estimated that said restaurant, with no other inheritors besides Marie, would most likely pass into Clayton hands in the fullness of time.No one had dared explain to her the differences between modern teenage dating and the genteel courtships of her youth.\"I dont think she reacted that oddly. Sure, she was so out of date that you had to explain that I meant French Indochina when I said that my parents came from Vietnam and she did seem a bit too fascinated with my families origins and, alright, it was weird hearing someone actually use the word courting without trying to be funny. However, it was kind of nice to speak French with someone in this town after all the time my parents invested in me learning it.\" Marie knew that while it had been terrifying for Joseph, having to put up with his relatives dissection of his relationship and fearing disapproval, she herself had enjoyed a chance to see if the old stereotypes were true. When it had become clear to Marie that the elderly woman was not about to spew racial epitaphs at her but was, indeed, fascinated as to her families background, Marie had made it a point to ham it up in telling their story.To an entranced Cora Clayton, Marie had described her parents lives before emigration as a subsistence existence in a village high up in the fog-choked mountain passes. She had woven scenes of her people worshiping strange, heathen gods far from the civilized lands of the Buddha and partaking in ghastly rituals to ensure harvests of rice from narrow mountainside terraces. She told the old woman that her parents had tired of such a life and had dreamed of something more, something in the wider world glimpsed in third-hand magazines and radio broadcasts.After receiving a dispensation from their village shaman to leave (but promising to sent back remittances), they had made their way to Hanoi and then to Boston and finally to Glaston where, having never truly given up the more religious and symbolic aspects of their heathenish past, they nevertheless had made good names for themselves in the community. Marie had made sure that her prose had been both lurid and exotic so as to fully entrance a child of the Age of Empire as well as making proper use of tone, whether enraptured, casual or deathly serious, to emphasize mood. The end result was to make it sound as if her culture wasnt just some rural outlet of modern Vietnam or Laos, but as if it was truly unlike any other in the world.That was an opinion that Joseph was also rapidly adopting.They ate in relative silence for a while, the bustle of the lunch crowd beginning to die down as people left, many of them stopping to talk to Mr. Trinh at the till, expressing their concern over what had happened with the window. They were just about half done when Joseph began another conversation. \"So, did you know that theres a Heritage Day coming up at school in a few weeks?\"\"Yeah, and?\" Deep down in her gut, Marie was beginning to get a slightly worried feeling from the direction this conversation was going. This pretty much happened whenever the subject of her parents past came up but, like so many times before, she could probably bluff her way through it.\"I thought that, maybe, we could do something for it. I was thinking about dredging up something from Normandy because I didnt want to clog up the schedule with another variation of British regional culture.\" It sounded perfectly innocent, but Marie knew that this was a potentially tricky situation that might require misdirection, a convincing excuse and possible outright lying.She hated lying to Joseph.\"Alright then. You can do that, Ill do the Vietnamese thing and well knock em all dead.\" She answered with an enthusiasm that she hoped had betrayed nothing of her growing unease with the conversation. This seemed to provoke nothing but a non-committal murmur of agreement and thus, thinking that that was over with, she began eating again.However, that was not the end of it.\"By Vietnamese, do you mean the standard culture from around Hanoi... or the culture from your parents home village?\" Joseph asked, seemingly as if only for the purpose of clarification. There was much more behind it though, and whether it was just ingrained paranoia or any real danger of exposure, Marie knew that this was entering onto some very tenuous and potentially very dangerous ground. Still, the subject had to be breached.\"Arent they pretty much the same? I mean, sure, it was pretty rural back there, but whether village or city, we were all Viet: same language, same culture, same blood, same... pretty much everything, when you think about it.\" As denials went, this one wasnt half bad: sincere enough to be taken seriously and with enough internal logic that it wouldnt fall apart immediately in the face of the mildly educated mind.On this subject, however, Joseph had become rather more than merely mildly educated. He had observed things for a long time: a lot of little things and one or two big things for the most part. And he, after long deliberation and study, had discovered that some of those things just didnt match up.\"You know, there was a time when I could believe that. But... there are just too many deviations to discount.\" Joesph stopped eating all together, putting down his fork and looking his girlfriend straight in the eyes before closing and opening them again, as if to rally his thoughts. \"The food, for one thing, isnt like any kind of Vietnamese food Ive read about. Yes, you have the side dishes but thats about it for similarity. Second, your parents tattoos. Again, unlike any other group in Southeast Asia; the closest matches I could find were incised lines on bronze figurines from over two thousand years ago.\"He stopped again. \"And then theres the language you guys speak. Im fairly sure its in the Mon-Khmer group, but Ive been doing some research and... honestly, Ive seen words on this menu that Ive never been able to find in any other source. And Im not the only one whos noticed these things.\" Joesph saw panic flash across Maries eyes, though she tried to hide it. \"Most people dont pay attention and honestly dont care, and the ones who do notice just assume that you guys are either Hmong or some little minority that no-ones ever heard of... but even that doesnt match very well either. Its like you said, youre Viet... but what about all this other stuff?\"It was then that Marie could have ended it all: the doubts, the questions, the lingering curiosity... as well as twenty one centuries of secrecy, tradition and very likely her relationship with this young man. In the end, she decided to dodge again. \"What can I say? We were very rural.\" When Joesph just got this frustrated look on his face, Marie sighed, reached across the table and enveloped one of his hands with hers. \"Look, Ill try and dredge something up if I can, but I cant promise anything, okay?\"Joseph mulled on this lack of answers, but as the moment dragged on, his resistance wore down. \"Alright. If you dont want to talk about your culture, thats alright; lots of people come to America to get away from stuff. But I still am sorta curious.\" Then he changed the subject. \"Anyway, after we eat, we should begin studying for our tests. Do you want to go over the English or the Algebra first?\"\"We should do the Math first, then we can cool off with the Shakespeare. But we better not let the food get cold, what with how the sauce gets if allowed to sit for too long.\" Marie began eating again and, after a few beats, Joseph resumed as well.They stayed at that table for many hours, going over and revising their knowledge of maths and literature. However, already Marie wondered if there was something she could reveal, something that she could show about her parents culture that would not threaten expose them and, as the old saying went among her tribe, get them cut in half and buried in two graves.Later that night, The Trinhs upstairs apartmentTo Maries relief, her parents reaction to her plan wasnt anger. On the other hand, fear and worry could be almost as painful.\"I know how you feel about the Clayton boy. Hes well-liked, intelligent and his parents are our insurance agents.\" Thanh Thi Trinh began, speaking in her families particular dialect of Viet as she, Marie and Thuch Van sat around their dining room table. \"But I ask this of you: is Joesph and his interest in this celebration worth the risk of exposure and, may I add, possible death when this town realizes who we are, when they realize what we are?\" Thanh Thi had always been the more reserved, more cautious and, frankly, more paranoid spouse in this family when it came to their safety. Where her husband was the face of the restaurant, she ran the kitchen with an eye on the back door and all of their cooks. While Thuch made friendly at social gatherings, Thanh kept track of all possible escape routes and who was and wasnt looking at them. She kept track of any news about gangs and hate-group activity in the area, and about any other strange things.The sort of things that might lure out the kind of people who hunted their people.But Marie had prepared for this. \"Mother, I know the risks that revealing the secrets of our people would bring. However, I am counting on two circumstances to make sure that only the most benign and harmless information is portrayed.\" She rallied herself, knowing that the way she handled this could make the difference on how she presented herself to nearly everyone, especially Joseph . \"First, I must inform both of you that there are some people in this town, including my boyfriend, that realize that we are not quite from the mainstream culture of modern Vietnam.\" At this, both Thanh and Thuch got even more worried but they werent shocked, seeing as any bumpkin with an Internet connection could find that tribal tattooing wasnt really the rage in downtown Hanoi. \"The good news is that while these people realize that we belong to a distinct subgroup, they often deduce that we are either rural Hmong or some other obscure ethnic group. In other words, they know nothing about who our people are and, like the rest of the town, they honestly do not care.\"\"What about the nature of our traditons, Marie? What would you do, what rite of our people would be performed on that stage that would not end up with half the town vomiting and the other half trying to hang us?\" Her father had been relatively quiet in this conversation, but he knew that the rituals of his village had, during various times in history, left such a bad impression upon outsiders that they had responded in force to try to stamp them out.Here, Marie began grasping the thick, heavy and old scrapbook that lay closed upon the table before her. It had been entrusted to them by their village and, by the blessings of the Gods and their Instrument, they had kept it safe and hidden for more than twenty years. \"Father, it is not as if I wish to set up an alter on the stage, recite the incantations of the harvest rites and slice something open; frankly, I would have no idea how. However, I believe that there is a ritual that is benign, unusual and, even according to the author of this book, beautiful enough to make people forget its oddity.\" She opened the book, filled with sepia photographs and notes written in French on yellowed paper, to the page she had bookmarked. \"I want to do the Stork Dance.\"Her parents were quiet for a minute. Admittedly, this was probably the least unusual rite of their people and it did seem to have a calming effect on its audiences. However, it took weeks of intensive training in order to do it right, the costuming and specific actions depended on whether the dancer was a man or woman and the phonograph with the instrumental music and vocals, only having been recorded once before, was on the other side of the planet. It was a tall order to pull off for anyone. \"You do realize that practicing for the dance requires grueling routine, so much so that it might effect your school work?\" Asked her mother, wondering if her daughter was truly sincere.\"I know that. Ill just have to sacrifice my time with Joesph, a sacrifice that Im sure hed understand.\" Marie responded in English this time, the plans for her act becoming clearer. \"However, Ill need some help in creating the proper costuming and... I know that shipping items from the Old Country is like trying to smuggle Plutonium but if you could convince the shamans to release that phonograph for a month or two, I would be eternally grateful to all of them, and to you.\"Her parents wondered, not for the first time, if Marie truly comprehended what could be asked of that gratitude in the years to come. She had the opportunity to live a life completely detached from the paranoia, the fear and the constant danger that followed her people. Would she give that chance away simply for the sake of a boy?Whatever choice she made, however, was hers to make.In the end, they acquiesced... but not without informing their daughter of what their home village could ask of her in exchange for the items she wished. It might be years until it was asked but one day, a representative of their village would approach her and request a repayment, be it in money, information or something else.It was that \"something else\" that truly worried Thuch and Thanh.", "Joseph Clayton watched from his seat on the center aisle as Pete Tallier finished his act. The young man had performed a folk-dance from his ancestral Quebec, a homeland his family had left more than a century ago for jobs in the New England furniture industry. He himself had finished his act more than an hour ago, having opted for a simple folk dance and traditional Norman costume with a top hat. Of course, using a hat-rack instead of a dancing partner had been a bit... unusual; with Marie being so involved in her own routine, he had had to make do with what he could get.But now, as Joseph finished clapping in approval of the previous act, he realized that his girlfriend was due to come on. What would actually happen was a complete mystery to Joseph; Marie had kept a tight lid on her act by practicing at home and while she had spent much less time with him than normal, she had stressed how important this was for her. So, respecting her wishes, hed kept his distance and wished her luck. Now, with his parents sitting beside him, the Trinhs just across the aisle and after weeks of mystery, he was finally about to discover what the big secret was.The male student in charge of the event came forward after Tallier left the stage, dressed in traditional Greek costume. \"Next up is Marie Trinh, who will be performing a traditional journey rite in two parts from the Annamite Mountains of Vietnam and Laos. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you The Stork Dance!\" He exited downstage right as the lights dimmed even further than they had, the only illumination the bright center of the spotlight focused on the place he had been. Slowly, almost dramatically, the spotlight edged back towards the rear wall until it revealed a lone figure wrapped in a white cloak, face obscured by something.Utter silence pervaded the auditorium before the sound system gave off the squeal of a needle scratching on a record and the sounds of soft, high flutes began wafting upon the air. It was then that the figure started walking forward on bare feet, segmented anklets of carved jade just visible below the hem of the long, black skirt while the white cloak draped over the arms and... it almost looked like some sort of hat or strange mask was concealing the figures head. Suddenly, pipes of a lower pitch, possibly oboes, started playing a mournful tune and the figure stopped suddenly, lifting its head to face the crowd.A spoonbill... with a black beak. So that was what that big fuss with the paper-mache was about.The dance was in two parts. The first was a mournful, melancholy arrangement that supposedly was intended for farewell ceremonies. Zithers, oboes, various other instruments of the right mood and the creaky, brittle, almost sad songs of old women set the tone for the dance, a carefully choreographed routine that either imitated the intricate placement of a wading birds steps or imitated the slow soaring of those same birds. This was the Song of Departure. The second part, that of Arrival, was more...upbeat in its cadence. After the record was flipped, the plucking of lutes and brighter zithers, the delicate clanging of some sort of bells, jollier wind instruments and the celebratory singing of young women replaced the melancholy mood of earlier. The dancers steps also changed, with sudden, sprightly movements becoming the norm as imitations of courtship displays and feeding were performed.Throughout the dance, the audience had been enraptured by what was happening onstage. While Joseph was certainly enjoying his girlfriends act, he was not so enraptured that he failed to notice that several very strange things were happening in the darkened theater. The first change he noticed was the background odor. Slowly, over the course of the act, the smell in the theater had changed from the dry, dusty smell of upholstery and the hot metal of lighting equipment to... well, there was river mud, water thick with life, plants growing in the sun and warm wind. It wasnt a bad smell, but there was no real way that it could be coming from anywhere in the building.Other strange things were... shapes in the darkness. During the first part of the dance Joseph could have sworn that he glimpsed shadowy shapes moving in the aisle beside him, shapes that almost looked like... wading birds. During the second act, he could almost imagine that the silvery shapes of gliding birds were being outlined by the residual glare from the spotlight, though that could easily be passed off as wafting dust.Except that there wasnt that much dust in the theater.Thirdly, and much less unusually, an elderly man with thinning, almost white curly hair, wire rim spectacles and a short beard was watching the performance with interest, almost... studying it. Joseph had never seen him in the town before, so who was he and why was he here?And had he or anyone else seen the apparitions?When the dance was done and Marie (who had revealed herself at the end of the dance by taking off her headdress and taking a bow) had left the stage, Joseph kept thinking on that thought during the remaining acts. The smell had faded and gone, the shadows and shapes were no longer there but the mere hint of their possibility shook him. He was a person of science, of logic, of well-produced nature documentaries; in the real world, things like this did not happen outside the heads of crazy people.However... the very thought of the ghostly shapes thrilled Joseph, filled him with fantastic wonders and terrors not felt since he was a boy of five. And, thought the young man, it did not truly matter if it was wonderful or terrible, or if Marie could control or even knew about this sort of stuff. All that truly mattered was that... well, at the level of base wonderment, the entire experience was remarkably exciting.Sinister? Maybe. Normal? Not in the least. But very definitely exciting.But... maybe it would be best not to mention it until Marie brought it up.LaterAfter the show, as students were putting away their costumes and props and donning their late-autumn outerwear, Joseph approached his girlfriend who, with dress, cloak and headpiece in a garment bag, was heading out the door after her parents. \"Hey, Marie... about what you did on stage tonight?\"\"Yes?\" Questioned Marie as she turned towards Joseph. As a courtesy, he would never mention it but he could tell that something was weighing on her mind. The impression that she was on the very edge of flight made it seem that, perhaps, she was aware that strange things had happened.Strange things... but not necessarily bad things.\"I just have to say that you really hit a crowd pleaser tonight. I dont think any of the other acts got as much applause as yours did.\" With that, Joseph saw Maries face lighten from the mask of apprehension that had been there into a gratified smile.\"Thanks. You wouldnt believe how grueling the practicing was and then the costume and making all those fake pendants and charms... after all that, I was hoping it would get a good reception.\" With that, she turned back and began walking out into the early night air, over to the parking space where her parents had parked their combination commercial van and personal conveyance.Joseph had actively resisted losing himself in the weirdness that had struck him in the auditorium. However, he could never resist losing himself in his girlfriends smile.Perhaps because one was familiar and one was a bit... odd.Running to catch up with Marie, he wanted to ask his girlfriend something. \"On a different subject, I was wondering if you were doing anything tonight. Maybe we could catch a movie, go bowling, something like that.\"\"Id like to but I really cant.\" They were almost at the Trinhs van when Marie leaned in close to Joseph to whisper conspiratorially. \"Dad got a call from the cops when the Polish guy was on. They arrested someone vandalizing the front of the shop, and well probably be busy all night with statements, forms, the insurance guys and all the other police stuff.\"Though he was disappointed, Joseph Clayton knew that something like this couldnt be delayed. \"Alright, maybe Ill see you tomorrow. Goodnight.\" After getting an answer back in the form of a goodnight kiss (which still made him blush despite himself), he watched Marie depart toward her parents vehicle. The question came back to him, after all these weeks, of who in this town could be angry or stupid enough to be implicated in the vandalism spree that had plagued the Leng Trinh restaurant.At Roughly the Same time, Glaston Police StationAs Constance Blake entered the interview room, she reflected on the fact that it had to have been a pretty slow couple of weeks when they pulled the Chief of Police out of her office for a break in a vandalism case. On the other hand, shed finished the normal paperwork an hour before and had been flipping through a fishing catalog with the squawk-box on beside her when Lt. Anderson had come in. Hed told her that theyd arrested some punk kid trying to bust up the Trinhs restaurant, the culmination in a series of events that had been the height of municipal intrigue for weeks. As she got a look at the culprit, she was a little surprised.\"Punk kid\" indeed.As she sat down across from suspect, Chief Blake tapped the case file, a few reports inside a paper folder, against the table. \"You know,\" she began dryly, \"we get quite a few idiots through here: gang members, druggies, people whove taken offense one to many times. We just havent ever got one who was this high up in the High School Math Club.\" She dropped the file in front of Than Quang Due, a young man who, besides having a Sino-typical naming structure, was short, thin, bespectacled and looked amazingly like a 12-year old for someone who was actually 15. He and his parents had moved here the the summer and had set up a jewelery shop a few blocks over from Leng Trinh. Up until this, Due had never been anything but a model student, a respectful son and a bright (if somewhat timid) young man. \"So, whyd you do it?\"Due looked at the middle aged woman with a gaze that mixed deference with surprise in the face of seeming insanity. \"Because no one else would! Because this town has tolerated... people like that for so long.\". There was a touch of bitterness in his voice but also surprise. Were these people so stupid that they didnt recognize a threat in their very midst?\"Look, I dont know whats going on, but I know that it stops right now.\" Constance stood up and, even at 51\", the sight of her leaning over the suspect should have been intimidating to the boy. But then Blake began asking almost rhetorical questions \"What is this about anyway? You ask out their daughter and get refused? Well, if that is it, this was between you, her and the Clayton boy. No need to get mad at her parents.\" It was then that another idea came to the Chief of Police. \"Or is this because theyre Hmong?\"At this, Dues face carried a look of utter incomprehension.\"Look, I realize that theres some bad blood carried over from the War. But you have to realize something too: this is America, the land of opportunity, of freedom. This is the land where people should be able to get away from the madness, where every little feud and squabble is best left back in the old country. Now, your parents and the Trinhs are going to be here soon and if youre smart, you will apologize; Thuc Van and Thanh Thi are good people, theyre liked in the community and as sure as God made little green apples, they didnt deserve any of this.\"It was then that realization dawned on Due. The people who had informed him and sent him on this mission had mandated secrecy... but apparently he and they werent the only ones good at keeping secrets.With a look that held a touch of arrogance, a smidgen of fascinated bewilderment and, especially in his grin, the hint that he was not totally mentally hinged, Due asked a question that infuriated Constance Blake. \"You have no idea what they are, do you?\""]}
{"id": "EN013", "pair": ["III. A Search and an Evocation1.Charles Ward, as we have seen, first learned in 1918 of his descent from Joseph Curwen. That he at once took an intense interest in everything pertaining to the bygone mystery is not to be wondered at; for every vague rumour that he had heard of Curwen now became something vital to himself, in whom flowed Curwens blood. No spirited and imaginative genealogist could have done otherwise than begin forthwith an avid and systematic collection of Curwen data.      In his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at secrecy; so that even Dr. Lyman hesitates to date the youths madness from any period before the close of 1919. He talked freely with his family - though his mother was not particularly pleased to own an ancestor like Curwen - and with the officials of the various museums and libraries he visited. In applying to private families for records thought to be in their possession he made no concealment of his object, and shared the somewhat amused scepticism with which the accounts of the old diarists and letter-writers were regarded. He often expressed a keen wonder as to what really had taken place a century and a half before at that Pawtuxet farmhouse whose site he vainly tried to find, and what Joseph Curwen really had been.      When he came across the Smith diary and archives and encountered the letter from Jedediah Orne he decided to visit Salem and look up Curwens early activities and connexions there, which he did during the Easter vacation of 1919. At the Essex Institute, which was well known to him from former sojourns in the glamorous old town of crumbling Puritan gables and clustered gambrel roofs, he was very kindly received, and unearthed there a considerable amount of Curwen data. He found that his ancestor was born in Salem-Village, now Danvers, seven miles from town, on the eighteenth of February (O.S.) 1662-3; and that he had run away to sea at the age of fifteen, not appearing again for nine years, when he returned with the speech, dress, and manners of a native Englishman and settled in Salem proper. At that time he had little to do with his family, but spent most of his hours with the curious books he had brought from Europe, and the strange chemicals which came for him on ships from England, France, and Holland. Certain trips of his into the country were the objects of much local inquisitiveness, and were whisperingly associated with vague rumours of fires on the hills at night.      Curwens only close friends had been one Edward Hutchinson of Salem-Village and one Simon Orne of Salem. With these men he was often seen in conference about the Common, and visits among them were by no means infrequent. Hutchinson had a house well out toward the woods, and it was not altogether liked by sensitive people because of the sounds heard there at night. He was said to entertain strange visitors, and the lights seen from his windows were not always of the same colour. The knowledge he displayed concerning long-dead persons and long-forgotten events was considered distinctly unwholesome, and he disappeared about the time the witchcraft panic began, never to be heard from again. At that time Joseph Curwen also departed, but his settlement in Providence was soon learned of. Simon Orne lived in Salem until 1720, when his failure to grow visibly old began to excite attention. He thereafter disappeared, though thirty years later his precise counterpart and self-styled son turned up to claim his property. The claim was allowed on the strength of documents in Simon Ornes known hand, and Jedediah Orne continued to dwell in Salem till 1771, when certain letters from Providence citizens to the Rev. Thomas Barnard and others brought about his quiet removal to parts unknown.      Certain documents by and about all of these strange characters were available at the Essex Institute, the Court House, and the Registry of Deeds, and included both harmless commonplaces such as land titles and bills of sale, and furtive fragments of a more provocative nature. There were four or five unmistakable allusions to them on the witchcraft trial records; as when one Hepzibah Lawson swore on July 10, 1692, at the Court of Oyer and Terminer under Judge Hathorne, that fortie Witches and the Blacke Man were wont to meete in the Woodes behind Mr. Hutchinsons house, and one Amity How declared at a session of August 8th before Judge Gedney that Mr. G. B. (Rev. George Burroughs) on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B. Then there was a catalogue of Hutchinsons uncanny library as found after his disappearance, and an unfinished manuscript in his handwriting, couched in a cipher none could read. Ward had a photostatic copy of this manuscript made, and began to work casually on the cipher as soon as it was delivered to him. After the following August his labours on the cipher became intense and feverish, and there is reason to believe from his speech and conduct that he hit upon the key before October or November. He never stated, though, whether or not he had succeeded.      But of the greatest immediate interest was the Orne material. It took Ward only a short time to prove from identity of penmanship a thing he had already considered established from the text of the letter to Curwen; namely, that Simon Orne and his supposed son were one and the same person. As Orne had said to his correspondent, it was hardly safe to live too long in Salem, hence he resorted to a thirty-year sojourn abroad, and did not return to claim his lands except as a representative of a new generation. Orne had apparently been careful to destroy most of his correspondence, but the citizens who took action in 1771 found and preserved a few letters and papers which excited their wonder. There were cryptic formulae and diagrams in his and other hands which Ward now either copied with care or had photographed, and one extremely mysterious letter in a chirography that the searcher recognised from items in the Registry of Deeds as positively Joseph Curwens.      This Curwen letter, though undated as to the year, was evidently not the one in answer to which Orne had written the confiscated missive; and from internal evidence Ward placed it not much later than 1750. It may not be amiss to give the text in full, as a sample of the style of one whose history was so dark and terrible. The recipient is addressed as \"Simon\", but a line (whether drawn by Curwen or Orne Ward could not tell) is run through the word.Prouidence, I.

This letter, oddly enough, was what first gave Ward the exact location of Curwens Providence home; for none of the records encountered up to that time had been at all specific. The discovery was doubly striking because it indicated as the newer Curwen house built in 1761 on the site of the old, a dilapidated building still standing in Olney Court and well known to Ward in his antiquarian rambles over Stampers Hill. The place was indeed only a few squares from his own home on the great hills higher ground, and was now the abode of a negro family much esteemed for occasional washing, housecleaning, and furnace-tending services. To find, in distant Salem, such sudden proof of the significance of this familiar rookery in his own family history, was a highly impressive thing to Ward; and he resolved to explore the place immediately upon his return. The more mystical phases of the letter, which he took to be some extravagant kind of symbolism, frankly baffled him; though he noted with a thrill of curiosity that the Biblical passage referred to - Job 14, 14 - was the familiar verse, \"If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.\"2.      Young Ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement, and spent the following Saturday in a long and exhaustive study of the house in Olney Court. The place, now crumbling with age, had never been a mansion; but was a modest two-and-a-half story wooden town house of the familiar Providence colonial type, with plain peaked roof, large central chimney, and artistically carved doorway with rayed fanlight, triangular pediment, and trim Doric pilasters. It had suffered but little alteration externally, and Ward felt he was gazing on something very close to the sinister matters of his quest.      The present negro inhabitants were known to him, and he was very courteously shewn about the interior by old Asa and his stout wife Hannah. Here there was more change than the outside indicated, and Ward saw with regret that fully half of the fine scroll-and-urn overmantels and shell-carved cupboard linings were gone, whilst much of the fine wainscotting and bolection moulding was marked, hacked, and gouged, or covered up altogether with cheap wall-paper. In general, the survey did not yield as much as Ward had somehow expected; but it was at least exciting to stand within the ancestral walls which had housed such a man of horror as Joseph Curwen. He saw with a thrill that a monogram had been very carefully effaced from the ancient brass knocker.      From then until after the close of school Ward spent his time on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local Curwen data. The former still proved unyielding; but of the latter he obtained so much, and so many clues to similar data elsewhere, that he was ready by July to make a trip to New London and New York to consult old letters whose presence in those places was indicated. This trip was very fruitful, for it brought him the Fenner letters with their terrible description of the Pawtuxet farmhouse raid, and the Nightingale-Talbot letters in which he learned of the portrait painted on a panel of the Curwen library. This matter of the portrait interested him particularly, since he would have given much to know just what Joseph Curwen looked like; and he decided to make a second search of the house in Olney Court to see if there might not be some trace of the ancient features beneath peeling coats of later paint or layers of mouldy wall-paper.      Early in August that search took place, and Ward went carefully over the walls of every room sizeable enough to have been by any possibility the library of the evil builder. He paid especial attention to the large panels of such overmantels as still remained; and was keenly excited after about an hour, when on a broad area above the fireplace in a spacious ground-floor room he became certain that the surface brought out by the peeling of several coats of paint was sensibly darker than any ordinary interior paint or the wood beneath it was likely to have been. A few more careful tests with a thin knife, and he knew that he had come upon an oil portrait of great extent. With truly scholarly restraint the youth did not risk the damage which an immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture with the knife might have done, but just retired from the scene of his discovery to enlist expert help. In three days he returned with an artist of long experience, Mr. Walter C. Dwight, whose studio is near the foot of College Hill; and that accomplished restorer of paintings set to work at once with proper methods and chemical substances. Old Asa and his wife were duly excited over their strange visitors, and were properly reimbursed for this invasion of their domestic hearth.      As day by day the work of restoration progressed, Charles Ward looked on with growing interest at the lines and shades gradually unveiled after their long oblivion. Dwight had begun at the bottom; hence since the picture was a three-quarter-length one, the face did not come out for some time. It was meanwhile seen that the subject was a spare, well-shaped man with dark-blue coat, embroidered waistcoat, black satin small-clothes, and white silk stockings, seated in a carved chair against the background of a window with wharves and ships beyond. When the head came out it was observed to bear a neat Albemarle wig, and to possess a thin, calm, undistinguished face which seemed somehow familiar to both Ward and the artist. Only at the very last, though, did the restorer and his client begin to gasp with astonishment at the details of that lean, pallid visage, and to recognise with a touch of awe the dramatic trick which heredity had played. For it took the final bath of oil and the final stroke of the delicate scraper to bring out fully the expression which centuries had hidden; and to confront the bewildered Charles Dexter Ward, dweller in the past, with his own living features in the countenance of his horrible great-great-great-grandfather.      Ward brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered, and his father at once determined to purchase the picture despite its execution on stationary panelling. The resemblance to the boy, despite an appearance of rather greater age, was marvellous; and it could be seen that through some trick of atavism the physical contours of Joseph Curwen had found precise duplication after a century and a half. Mrs. Wards resemblance to her ancestor was not at all marked, though she could recall relatives who had some of the facial characteristics shared by her son and by the bygone Curwen. She did not relish the discovery, and told her husband that he had better burn the picture instead of bringing it home. There was, she averred, something unwholesome about it; not only intrinsically, but in its very resemblance to Charles. Mr. Ward, however, was a practical man of power and affairs - a cotton manufacturer with extensive mills at Riverpoint in the Pawtuxet Valley - and not one to listen to feminine scruples. The picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to his son, and he believed the boy deserved it as a present. In this opinion, it is needless to say, Charles most heartily concurred; and a few days later Mr. Ward located the owner of the house - a small rodent-featured person with a guttural accent - and obtained the whole mantel and overmantel bearing the picture at a curtly fixed priced which cut short the impending torrent of unctuous haggling.      It now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the Ward home, where provisions were made for its thorough restoration and installation with an electric mock-fireplace in Charless third-floor study or library. To Charles was left the task of superintending this removal, and on the twenty-eighth of August he accompanied two expert workmen from the Crooker decorating firm to the house in Olney Court, where the mantel and portrait-bearing overmantel were detached with great care and precision for transportation in the companys motor truck. There was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the chimneys course, and in this young Ward observed a cubical recess about a foot square, which must have lain directly behind the head of the portrait. Curious as to what such a space might mean or contain, the youth approached and looked within; finding beneath the deep coatings of dust and soot some loose yellowed papers, a crude, thick copybook, and a few mouldering textile shreds which may have formed the ribbon binding the rest together. Blowing away the bulk of the dirt and cinders, he took up the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover. It was in a hand which he had learned to recognise at the Essex Institute, and proclaimed the volume as the \"Journall and Notes of Jos: Curwen, Gent., of Providence-Plantations, Late of Salem.\"      Excited beyond measure by his discovery, Ward shewed the book to the two curious workmen beside him. Their testimony is absolute as to the nature and genuineness of the finding, and Dr. Willett relies on them to help establish his theory that the youth was not mad when he began his major eccentricities. All the other papers were likewise in Curwens handwriting, and one of them seemed especially portentous because of its inscription: \"To Him Who Shal Come After, & How He May Gett Beyonde Time & ye Spheres.\" Another was in a cipher; the same, Ward hoped, as the Hutchinson cipher which had hitherto baffled him. A third, and here the searcher rejoiced, seemed to be a key to the cipher; whilst the fourth and fifth were addressed respectively to \"Edw: Hutchinson, Armiger\" and \"Jedediah Orne, Esq.\", or Their Heir or Heirs, or Those Representg Them. The sixth and last was inscribed: \"Joseph Curwen his Life and Travells Betn ye yeares 1678 and 1687: Of Whither He Voyagd, Where He Stayd, Whom He Sawe, and What He Learnt.\"3.      We have now reached the point from which the more academic school of alienists date Charles Wards madness. Upon his discovery the youth had looked immediately at a few of the inner pages of the book and manuscripts, and had evidently seen something which impressed him tremendously. Indeed, in shewing the titles to the workmen he appeared to guard the text itself with peculiar care, and to labour under a perturbation for which even the antiquarian and genealogical significance of the find could hardly account. Upon returning home he broke the news with an almost embarrassed air, as if he wished to convey an idea of its supreme importance without having to exhibit the evidence itself. He did not even shew the titles to his parents, but simply told them that he had found some documents in Joseph Curwens handwriting, \"mostly in cipher\", which would have to be studied very carefully before yielding up their true meaning. It is unlikely that he would have shewn what he did to the workmen, had it not been for their unconcealed curiosity. As it was he doubtless wished to avoid any display of peculiar reticence which would increase their discussion of the matter.      That night Charles Ward sat up in his room reading the new-found book and papers, and when day came he did not desist. His meals, on his urgent request when his mother called to see what was amiss, were sent up to him; and in the afternoon he appeared only briefly when the men came to install the Curwen picture and mantelpiece in his study. The next night he slept in snatches in his clothes, meanwhile wrestling feverishly with the unravelling of the cipher manuscript. In the morning his mother saw that he was at work on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher, which he had frequently shewn her before; but in response to her query he said that the Curwen key could not be applied to it. That afternoon he abandoned his work and watched the men fascinatedly as they finished their installation of the picture with its woodwork above a cleverly realistic electric log, setting the mock-fireplace and overmantel a little out from the north wall as if a chimney existed, and boxing in the sides with panelling to match the rooms. The front panel holding the picture was sawn and hinged to allow cupboard space behind it. After the workmen went he moved his work into the study and sat down before it with his eyes half on the cipher and half on the portrait which stared back at him like a year-adding and century-recalling mirror.      His parents, subsequently recalling his conduct at this period, give interesting details anent the policy of concealment which he practiced. Before servants he seldom hid any paper which he might be studying, since he rightly assumed that Curwens intricate and archaic chirography would be too much for them. With his parents, however, he was more circumspect; and unless the manuscript in question were a cipher, or a mere mass of cryptic symbols and unknown ideographs (as that entitled \"To Him Who Shal Come After etc.\" seemed to be), he would cover it with some convenient paper until his caller had departed. At night he kept the papers under lock and key in an antique cabinet of his, where he also placed them whenever he left the room. He soon resumed fairly regular hours and habits, except that his long walks and other outside interests seemed to cease. The opening of school, where he now began his senior year, seemed a great bore to him; and he frequently asserted his determination never to bother with college. He had, he said, important special investigations to make, which would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and the humanities than any university which the world could boast.      Naturally, only one who had always been more or less studious, eccentric, and solitary could have pursued this course for many days without attracting notice. Ward, however, was constitutionally a scholar and a hermit; hence his parents were less surprised than regretful at the close confinement and secrecy he adopted. At the same time, both his father and mother thought it odd that he would shew them no scrap of his treasure-trove, nor give any connected account of such data as he had deciphered. This reticence he explained away as due to a wish to wait until he might announce some connected revelation, but as the weeks passed without further disclosures there began to grow up between the youth and his family a kind of constraint; intensified in his mothers case by her manifest disapproval of all Curwen delvings.      During October Ward began visiting the libraries again, but no longer for the antiquarian matter of his former days. Witchcraft and magic, occultism and daemonology, were what he sought now; and when Providence sources proved unfruitful he would take the train for Boston and tap the wealth of the great library in Copley Square, the Widener Library at Harvard, or the Zion Research Library in Brookline, where certain rare works on Biblical subjects are available. He bought extensively, and fitted up a whole additional set of shelves in his study for newly acquired works on uncanny subjects; while during the Christmas holidays he made a round of out-of-town trips including one to Salem to consult certain records at the Essex Institute.      About the middle of January, 1920, there entered Wards bearing an element of triumph which he did not explain, and he was no more found at work upon the Hutchinson cipher. Instead, he inaugurated a dual policy of chemical research and record-scanning; fitting up for the one a laboratory in the unused attic of the house, and for the latter haunting all the sources of vital statistics in Providence. Local dealers in drugs and scientific supplies, later questioned, gave astonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and instruments he purchased; but clerks at the State House, the City Hall, and the various libraries agree as to the definite object of his second interest. He was searching intensely and feverishly for the grave of Joseph Curwen, from whose slate slab an older generation had so wisely blotted the name.      Little by little there grew upon the Ward family the conviction that something was wrong. Charles had had freaks and changes of minor interests before, but this growing secrecy and absorption in strange pursuits was unlike even him. His school work was the merest pretence; and although he failed in no test, it could be seen that the old application had all vanished. He had other concernments now; and when not in his new laboratory with a score of obsolete alchemical books, could be found either poring over old burial records down town or glued to his volumes of occult lore in his study, where the startlingly - one almost fancied increasingly - similar features of Joseph Curwen stared blandly at him from the great overmantel on the north wall.      Late in March Ward added to his archive-searching a ghoulish series of rambles about the various ancient cemeteries of the city. The cause appeared later, when it was learned from City Hall clerks that he had probably found an important clue. His quest had suddenly shifted from the grave of Joseph Curwen to that of one Naphthali Field; and this shift was explained when, upon going over the files that he had been over, the investigators actually found a fragmentary record of Curwens burial which had escaped the general obliteration, and which stated that the curious leaden coffin had been interred \"10 ft. S. and 5 ft. W. of Naphthali Fields grave in ye - \". The lack of a specified burying-ground in the surviving entry greatly complicated the search, and Naphthali Fields grave seemed as elusive as that of Curwen; but here no systematic effacement had existed, and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on the stone itself even if its record had perished. Hence the rambles - from which St. Johns (the former Kings) Churchyard and the ancient Congregational burying-ground in the midst of Swan Point Cemetery were excluded, since other statistics had shewn that the only Naphthali Field (obiit 1729) whose grave could have been meant had been a Baptist.4.      It was toward May when Dr. Willett, at the request of the senior Ward, and fortified with all the Curwen data which the family had gleaned from Charles in his non-secretive days, talked with the young man. The interview was of little value or conclusiveness, for Willett felt at every moment that Charles was thoroughly master of himself and in touch with matters of real importance; but it at least forced the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanour. Of a pallid, impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment, Ward seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits, though not to reveal their object. He stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early scientific knowledge, for the most part in cipher, of an apparent scope comparable only to the discoveries of Friar Bacon and perhaps surpassing even those. They were, however, meaningless except when correlated with a body of learning now wholly obsolete; so that their immediate presentation to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all impressiveness and dramatic significance. To take their vivid place in the history of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of which they evolved, and to this task of correlation Ward was now devoting himself. He was seeking to acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of the Curwen data must possess, and hoped in time to make a full announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to the world of thought. Not even Einstein, he declared, could more profoundly revolutionise the current conception of things.      As to his graveyard search, whose object he freely admitted, but the details of whose progress he did not relate, he said he had reason to think that Joseph Curwens mutilated headstone bore certain mystic symbols - carved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by those who had effaced the name - which were absolutely essential to the final solution of his cryptic system. Curwen, he believed, had wished to guard his secret with care; and had consequently distributed the data in an exceedingly curious fashion. When Dr. Willett asked to see the mystic documents, Ward displayed much reluctance and tried to put him off with such things as photostatic copies of the Hutchinson cipher and Orne formulae and diagrams; but finally shewed him the exteriors of some of the real Curwen finds - the \"Journall and Notes\", the cipher (title in cipher also), and the formula-filled message \"To Him Who Shal Come After\" - and let him glance inside such as were in obscure characters.      He also opened the diary at a page carefully selected for its innocuousness and gave Willett a glimpse of Curwens connected handwriting in English. The doctor noted very closely the crabbed and complicated letters, and the general aura of the seventeenth century which clung round both penmanship and style despite the writers survival into the eighteenth century, and became quickly certain that the document was genuine. The text itself was relatively trivial, and Willett recalled only a fragment:\"Wedn. 16 Octr. 1754. My Sloope the Wakeful this Day putt in from London with XX newe Men pickd up in ye Indies, Spaniards from Martineco and 2 Dutch Men from Surinam.

Simon hath not Writ these V. Weekes, but I expecte soon hearg from him.\"      When upon reaching this point Dr. Willett turned the leaf he was quickly checked by Ward, who almost snatched the book from his grasp. All that the doctor had a chance to see on the newly opened page was a brief pair of sentences; but these, strangely enough, lingered tenaciously in his memory. They ran: \"Ye Verse from Liber-Damnatus beg spoke V Roodmasses and IV Hallows-Eves, I am Hopeful ye Thing is breedg Outside ye Spheres. It will drawe One who is to Come, if I can make sure he shal bee, and he shall think on Past thinges and look back thro all ye yeares, against ye which I must have ready ye Saltes or That to make em with.\"      Willett saw no more, but somehow this small glimpse gave a new and vague terror to the painted features of Joseph Curwen which stared blandly down from the overmantel. Ever after that he entertained the odd fancy - which his medical skill of course assured him was only a fancy - that the eyes of the portrait had a sort of wish, if not an actual tendency, to follow young Charles Ward as he moved about the room. He stopped before leaving to study the picture closely, marvelling at its resemblance to Charles and memorising every minute detail of the cryptical, colourless face, even down to a slight scar or pit in the smooth brow above the right eye. Cosmo Alexander, he decided, was a painter worthy of the Scotland that produced Raeburn, and a teacher worthy of his illustrious pupil Gilbert Stuart.      Assured by the doctor that Charless mental health was in no danger, but that on the other hand he was engaged in researches which might prove of real importance, the Wards were more lenient than they might otherwise have been when during the following June the youth made positive his refusal to attend college. He had, he declared, studies of much more vital importance to pursue; and intimated a wish to go abroad the following year in order to avail himself of certain sources of data not existing in America. The senior Ward, while denying this latter wish as absurd for a boy of only eighteen, acquiesced regarding the university; so that after a none too brilliant graduation from the Moses Brown School there ensued for Charles a three-year period of intensive occult study and graveyard searching. He became recognised as an eccentric, and dropped even more completely from the sight of his familys friends than he had been before; keeping close to his work and only occasionally making trips to other cities to consult obscure records. Once he went south to talk with a strange old mulatto who dwelt in a swamp and about whom a newspaper had printed a curious article. Again he sought a small village in the Adirondacks whence reports of certain odd ceremonial practices had come. But still his parents forbade him the trip to the Old World which he desired.      Coming of age in April, 1923, and having previously inherited a small competence from his maternal grandfather, Ward determined at last to take the European trip hitherto denied him. Of his proposed itinerary he would say nothing save that the needs of his studies would carry him to many places, but he promised to write his parents fully and faithfully. When they saw he could not be dissuaded, they ceased all opposition and helped as best they could; so that in June the young man sailed for Liverpool with the farewell blessings of his father and mother, who accompanied him to Boston and waved him out of sight from the White Star pier in Charlestown. Letters soon told of his safe arrival, and of his securing good quarters in Great Russell Street, London; where he proposed to stay, shunning all family friends, till he had exhausted the resources of the British Museum in a certain direction. Of his daily life he wrote but little, for there was little to write. Study and experiment consumed all his time, and he mentioned a laboratory which he had established in one of his rooms. That he said nothing of antiquarian rambles in the glamorous old city with its luring skyline of ancient domes and steeples and its tangles of roads and alleys whose mystic convolutions and sudden vistas alternately beckon and surprise, was taken by his parents as a good index of the degree to which his new interests had engrossed his mind.      In June, 1924, a brief note told of his departure for Paris, to which he had before made one or two flying trips for material in the Bibliothque Nationale. For three months thereafter he sent only postal cards, giving an address in the Rue St. Jacques and referring to a special search among rare manuscripts in the library of an unnamed private collector. He avoided acquaintances, and no tourists brought back reports of having seen him. Then came a silence, and in October the Wards received a picture card from Prague, Czecho-Slovakia, stating that Charles was in that ancient town for the purpose of conferring with a certain very aged man supposed to be the last living possessor of some very curious mediaeval information. He gave an address in the Neustadt, and announced no move till the following January; when he dropped several cards from Vienna telling of his passage through that city on the way toward a more easterly region whither one of his correspondents and fellow-delvers into the occult had invited him.      The next card was from Klausenburg in Transylvania, and told of Wards progress toward his destination. He was going to visit a Baron Ferenczy, whose estate lay in the mountains east of Rakus; and was to be addressed at Rakus in the care of that nobleman. Another card from Rakus a week later, saying that his hosts carriage had met him and that he was leaving the village for the mountains, was his last message for a considerable time; indeed, he did not reply to his parents frequent letters until May, when he wrote to discourage the plan of his mother for a meeting in London, Paris, or Rome during the summer, when the elder Wards were planning to travel in Europe. His researches, he said, were such that he could not leave his present quarters; while the situation of Baron Ferenczys castle did not favour visits. It was on a crag in the dark wooded mountains, and the region was so shunned by the country folk that normal people could not help feeling ill at ease. Moreover, the Baron was not a person likely to appeal to correct and conservative New England gentlefolk. His aspect and manners had idiosyncrasies, and his age was so great as to be disquieting. It would be better, Charles said, if his parents would wait for his return to Providence; which could scarcely be far distant.      That return did not, however, take place until May, 1926, when after a few heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into New York on the Homeric and traversed the long miles to Providence by motor-coach, eagerly drinking in the green rolling hills, the fragrant, blossoming orchards, and the white steepled towns of vernal Connecticut; his first taste of ancient New England in nearly four years. When the coach crossed the Pawcatuck and entered Rhode Island amidst the faery goldenness of a late spring afternoon his heart beat with quickened force, and the entry to Providence along Reservoir and Elmwood avenues was a breathless and wonderful thing despite the depths of forbidden lore to which he had delved. At the high square where Broad, Weybosset, and Empire Streets join, he saw before and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant, remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town; and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down the terminal behind the Biltmore, bringing into view the great dome and soft, roof-pierced greenery of the ancient hill across the river, and the tall colonial spire of the First Baptist Church limned pink in the magic evening light against the fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous background.      Old Providence! It was this place and the mysterious forces of its long, continuous history which had brought him into being, and which had drawn him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no prophet might fix. Here lay the arcana, wondrous or dreadful as the case might be, for which all his years of travel and application had been preparing him. A taxicab whirled him through Post Office Square with its glimpse of the river, the old Market House, and the head of the bay, and up the steep curved slope of Waterman Street to Prospect, where the vast gleaming dome and sunset-flushed Ionic columns of the Christian Science Church beckoned northward. Then eight squares past the fine old estates his childish eyes had known, and the quaint brick sidewalks so often trodden by his youthful feet. And at last the little white overtaken farmhouse on the right, on the left the classic Adam porch and stately bayed facade of the great brick house where he was born. It was twilight, and Charles Dexter Ward had come home.5.      A school of alienists slightly less academic than Dr. Lymans assign to Wards European trip the beginning of his true madness. Admitting that he was sane when he started, they believe that his conduct upon returning implies a disastrous change. But even to this claim Dr. Willett refuses to accede. There was, he insists, something later; and the queernesses of the youth at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroad - odd enough things, to be sure, but by no means implying mental aberration on the part of their celebrant. Ward himself, though visibly aged and hardened, was still normal in his general reactions; and in several talks with Willett displayed a balance which no madman - even an incipient one - could feign continuously for long. What elicited the notion of insanity at this period were the sounds heard at all hours from Wards attic laboratory, in which he kept himself most of the time. There were chantings and repetitions, and thunderous declamations in uncanny rhythms; and although these sounds were always in Wards own voice, there was something in the quality of that voice, and in the accents of the formulae it pronounced, which could not but chill the blood of every hearer. It was noticed that Nig, the venerable and beloved black cat of the household, bristled and arched his back perceptibly when certain of the tones were heard.      The odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise exceedingly strange. Sometimes they were very noxious, but more often they were aromatic, with a haunting, elusive quality which seemed to have the power of inducing fantastic images. People who smelled them had a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas, with strange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite distance. Ward did not resume his old-time rambles, but applied himself diligently to the strange books he had brought home, and to equally strange delvings within his quarters; explaining that European sources had greatly enlarged the possibilities of his work, and promising great revelations in the years to come. His older aspect increased to a startling degree his resemblance to the Curwen portrait in his library; and Dr. Willett would often pause by the latter after a call, marvelling at the virtual identity, and reflecting that only the small pit above the pictures right eye now remained to differentiate the long-dead wizard from the living youth. These calls of Willetts, undertaken at the request of the senior Wards, were curious affairs. Ward at no time repulsed the doctor, but the latter saw that he could never reach the young mans inner psychology. Frequently he noted peculiar things about; little wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables, and the half-erased remnants of circles, triangles, and pentagrams in chalk or charcoal on the cleared central space of the large room. And always in the night those rhythms and incantations thundered, till it became very difficult to keep servants or suppress furtive talk of Charless madness.      In January, 1927, a peculiar incident occurred. One night about midnight, as Charles was chanting a ritual whose weird cadence echoed unpleasantly through the house below, there came a sudden gust of chill wind from the bay, and a faint, obscure trembling of the earth which everyone in the neighbourhood noted. At the same time the cat exhibited phenomenal traces of fright, while dogs bayed for as much as a mile around. This was the prelude to a sharp thunderstorm, anomalous for the season, which brought with it such a crash that Mr. and Mrs. Ward believed the house had been struck. They rushed upstairs to see what damage had been done, but Charles met them at the door to the attic; pale, resolute, and portentous, with an almost fearsome combination of triumph and seriousness on his face. He assured them that the house had not really been struck, and that the storm would soon be over. They paused, and looking through a window saw that he was indeed right; for the lightning flashed farther and farther off, whilst the trees ceased to bend in the strange frigid gust from the water. The thunder sank to a sort of dull mumbling chuckle and finally died away. Stars came out, and the stamp of triumph on Charles Wards face crystallised into a very singular expression.      For two months or more after this incident Ward was less confined than usual to his laboratory. He exhibited a curious interest in the weather, and made odd inquiries about the date of the spring thawing of the ground. One night late in March he left the house after midnight, and did not return till almost morning; when his mother, being wakeful, heard a rumbling motor draw up to the carriage entrance. Muffled oaths could be distinguished, and Mrs. Ward, rising and going to the window, saw four dark figures removing a long, heavy box from a truck at Charless direction and carrying it within by the side door. She heard laboured breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs, and finally a dull thumping in the attic; after which the footfalls descended again, and the four men reappeared outside and drove off in their truck.      The next day Charles resumed his strict attic seclusion, drawing down the dark shades of his laboratory windows and appearing to be working on some metal substance. He would open the door to no one, and steadfastly refused all proffered food. About noon a wrenching sound followed by a terrible cry and a fall were heard, but when Mrs. Ward rapped at the door her son at length answered faintly, and told her that nothing had gone amiss. The hideous and indescribable stench now welling out was absolutely harmless and unfortunately necessary. Solitude was the one prime essential, and he would appear later for dinner. That afternoon, after the conclusion of some odd hissing sounds which came from behind the locked portal, he did finally appear; wearing an extremely haggard aspect and forbidding anyone to enter the laboratory upon any pretext. This, indeed, proved the beginning of a new policy of secrecy; for never afterward was any other person permitted to visit either the mysterious garret workroom or the adjacent storeroom which he cleaned out, furnished roughly, and added to his inviolably private domain as a sleeping apartment. Here he lived, with books brought up from his library beneath, till the time he purchased the Pawtuxet bungalow and moved to it all his scientific effects.      In the evening Charles secured the paper before the rest of the family and damaged part of it through an apparent accident. Later on Dr. Willett, having fixed the date from statements by various members of the household, looked up an intact copy at the Journal office and found that in the destroyed section the following small item had occurred:Nocturnal Diggers Surprised inNorth Burial GroundRobert Hart, night watchman at the North Burial Ground, this morning discovered a party of several men with a motor truck in the oldest part of the cemetery, but apparently frightened them off before they had accomplished whatever their object may have been.      The discovery took place at about four oclock, when Harts attention was attracted by the sound of a motor outside his shelter. Investigating, he saw a large truck on the main drive several rods away; but could not reach it before the sound of his feet on the gravel had revealed his approach. The men hastily placed a large box in the truck and drove away toward the street before they could be overtaken; and since no known grave was disturbed, Hart believes that this box was an object which they wished to bury.      The diggers must have been at work for a long while before detection, for Hart found an enormous hole dug at a considerable distance back from the roadway in the lot of Amasa Field, where most of the old stones have long ago disappeared. The hole, a place as large and deep as a grave, was empty; and did not coincide with any interment mentioned in the cemetery records.      Sergt. Riley of the Second Station viewed the spot and gave the opinion that the hole was dug by bootleggers rather gruesomely and ingeniously seeking a safe cache for liquor in a place not likely to be disturbed. In reply to questions Hart said he thought the escaping truck had headed up Rochambeau Avenue, though he could not be sure.      During the next few days Ward was seldom seen by his family. Having added sleeping quarters to his attic realm, he kept closely to himself there, ordering food brought to the door and not taking it in until after the servant had gone away. The droning of monotonous formulae and the chanting of bizarre rhythms recurred at intervals, while at other times occasional listeners could detect the sound of tinkling glass, hissing chemicals, running water, or roaring gas flames. Odours of the most unplaceable quality, wholly unlike any before noted, hung at times around the door; and the air of tension observable in the young recluse whenever he did venture briefly forth was such as to excite the keenest speculation. Once he made a hasty trip to the Athenaeum for a book he required, and again he hired a messenger to fetch him a highly obscure volume from Boston. Suspense was written portentously over the whole situation, and both the family and Dr. Willett confessed themselves wholly at a loss what to do or think about it.6.      Then on the fifteenth of April a strange development occurred. While nothing appeared to grow different in kind, there was certainly a very terrible difference in degree; and Dr. Willett somehow attaches great significance to the change. The day was Good Friday, a circumstance of which the servants made much, but which others quite naturally dismiss as an irrelevant coincidence. Late in the afternoon young Ward began repeating a certain formula in a singularly loud voice, at the same time burning some substance so pungent that its fumes escaped over the entire house. The formula was so plainly audible in the hall outside the locked door that Mrs. Ward could not help memorising it as she waited and listened anxiously, and later on she was able to write it down at Dr. Willetts request. It ran as follows, and experts have told Dr. Willett that its very close analogue can be found in the mystic writings of \"Eliphas Levi\", that cryptic soul who crept through a crack in the forbidden door and glimpsed the frightful vistas of the void beyond:\"Per Adonai Eloim, Adonai Jehova,Adonai Sabaoth, Metraton On Agla Mathon,verbum pythonicum, mysterium salamandrae,conventus sylvorum, antra gnomorum,daemonia Coeli Gad, Almousin, Gibor, Jehosua,Evam, Zariatnatmik, veni, veni, veni.\"      This had been going on for two hours without change or intermission when over all the neighbourhood a pandaemoniac howling of dogs set in. The extent of this howling can be judged from the space it received in the papers the next day, but to those in the Ward household it was overshadowed by the odour which instantly followed it; a hideous, all-pervasive odour which none of them had ever smelt before or have ever smelt since. In the midst of this mephitic flood there came a very perceptible flash like that of lightning, which would have been blinding and impressive but for the daylight around; and then was heard the voice that no listener can ever forget because of its thunderous remoteness, its incredible depth, and its eldritch dissimilarity to Charles Wards voice. It shook the house, and was clearly heard by at least two neighbours above the howling of the dogs. Mrs. Ward, who had been listening in despair outside her sons locked laboratory, shivered as she recognised its hellish import; for Charles had told her of its evil fame in dark books, and of the manner in which it had thundered, according to the Fenner letters, above the doomed Pawtuxet farmhouse on the night of Joseph Curwens annihilation. There was no mistaking that nightmare phrase, for Charles had described it too vividly in the old days when he had talked frankly of his Curwen investigations. And yet it was only this fragment of an archaic and forgotten language: \"DIES MIES JESCHET BOENE DOESEF DOUVEMA ENITEMAUS\".      Close upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening of the daylight, though sunset was still an hour distant, and then a puff of added odour different from the first but equally unknown and intolerable. Charles was chanting again now and his mother could hear syllables that sounded like \"Yi-nash-Yog-Sothoth-he-lgeb-fi-throdog\" - ending in a \"Yah!\" whose maniacal force mounted in an ear-splitting crescendo. A second later all previous memories were effaced by the wailing scream which burst out with frantic explosiveness and gradually changed form to a paroxysm of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Mrs. Ward, with the mingled fear and blind courage of maternity, advanced and knocked affrightedly at the concealing panels, but obtained no sign of recognition. She knocked again, but paused nervelessly as a second shriek arose, this one unmistakably in the familiar voice of her son, and sounding concurrently with the still bursting cachinnations of that other voice. Presently she fainted, although she is still unable to recall the precise and immediate cause. Memory sometimes makes merciful deletions.      Mr. Ward returned from the business section at about quarter past six; and not finding his wife downstairs, was told by the frightened servants that she was probably watching at Charless door, from which the sounds had been far stranger than ever before. Mounting the stairs at once, he saw Mrs. Ward stretched at full length on the floor of the corridor outside the laboratory; and realising that she had fainted, hastened to fetch a glass of water from a set bowl in a neighbouring alcove. Dashing the cold fluid in her face, he was heartened to observe an immediate response on her part, and was watching the bewildered opening of her eyes when a chill shot through him and threatened to reduce him to the very state from which she was emerging. For the seemingly silent laboratory was not as silent as it had appeared to be, but held the murmurs of a tense, muffled conversation in tones too low for comprehension, yet of a quality profoundly disturbing to the soul.      It was not, of course, new for Charles to mutter formulae; but this muttering was definitely different. It was so palpably a dialogue, or imitation of a dialogue, with the regular alteration of inflections suggesting question and answer, statement and response. One voice was undisguisedly that of Charles, but the other had a depth and hollowness which the youths best powers of ceremonial mimicry had scarcely approached before. There was something hideous, blasphemous, and abnormal about it, and but for a cry from his recovering wife which cleared his mind by arousing his protective instincts it is not likely that Theodore Howland Ward could have maintained for nearly a year more his old boast that he had never fainted. As it was, he seized his wife in his arms and bore her quickly downstairs before she could notice the voices which had so horribly disturbed him. Even so, however, he was not quick enough to escape catching something himself which caused him to stagger dangerously with his burden. For Mrs. Wards cry had evidently been heard by others than he, and there had come from behind the locked door the first distinguishable words which that masked and terrible colloquy had yielded. They were merely an excited caution in Charless own voice, but somehow their implications held a nameless fright for the father who overheard them. The phrase was just this: \"Sshh! - write!\"      Mr. and Mrs. Ward conferred at some length after dinner, and the former resolved to have a firm and serious talk with Charles that very night. No matter how important the object, such conduct could no longer be permitted; for these latest developments transcended every limit of sanity and formed a menace to the order and nervous well-being of the entire household. The youth must indeed have taken complete leave of his senses, since only downright madness could have prompted the wild screams and imaginary conversations in assumed voices which the present day had brought forth. All this must be stopped, or Mrs. Ward would be made ill and the keeping of servants become an impossibility.      Mr. Ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for Charless laboratory. On the third floor, however, he paused at the sounds which he heard proceeding from the now disused library of his son. Books were apparently being flung about and papers wildly rustled, and upon stepping to the door Mr. Ward beheld the youth within, excitedly assembling a vast armful of literary matter of every size and shape. Charless aspect was very drawn and haggard, and he dropped his entire load with a start at the sound of his fathers voice. At the elder mans command he sat down, and for some time listened to the admonitions he had so long deserved. There was no scene. At the end of the lecture he agreed that his father was right, and that his noises, mutterings, incantations, and chemical odours were indeed inexcusable nuisances. He agreed to a policy of greater quiet, though insisting on a prolongation of his extreme privacy. Much of his future work, he said, was in any case purely book research; and he could obtain quarters elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be necessary at a later stage. For the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed the keenest contrition, and explained that the conversation later heard was part of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental atmosphere. His use of abstruse technical terms somewhat bewildered Mr. Ward, but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and poise despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity. The interview was really quite inconclusive, and as Charles picked up his armful and left the room Mr. Ward hardly knew what to make of the entire business. It was as mysterious as the death of poor old Nig, whose stiffening form had been found an hour before in the basement, with staring eyes and fear-distorted mouth.      Driven by some vague detective instinct, the bewildered parent now glanced curiously at the vacant shelves to see what his son had taken up to the attic. The youths library was plainly and rigidly classified, so that one might tell at a glance the books or at least the kind of books which had been withdrawn. On this occasion Mr. Ward was astonished to find that nothing of the occult or the antiquarian, beyond what had been previously removed, was missing. These new withdrawals were all modern items; histories, scientific treatises, geographies, manuals of literature, philosophic works, and certain contemporary newspapers and magazines. It was a very curious shift from Charles Wards recent run of reading, and the father paused in a growing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense of strangeness. The strangeness was a very poignant sensation, and almost clawed at his chest as he strove to see just what was wrong around him. Something was indeed wrong, and tangibly as well as spiritually so. Ever since he had been in this room he had known that something was amiss, and at last it dawned upon him what it was.      On the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the house in Olney Court, but to the cracked and precariously restored oils of the large Curwen portrait disaster had come. Time and unequal heating had done their work at last, and at some time since the rooms last cleaning the worst had happened. Peeling clear of the wood, curling tighter and tighter, and finally crumbling into small bits with what must have been malignly silent suddenness, the portrait of Joseph Curwen had resigned forever its staring surveillance of the youth it so strangely resembled, and now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust.", "“Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimaeras—dire stories of Celaeno and the Harpies—may reproduce themselves in the brain of superstition—but they were there before. They are transcripts, types—the archetypes are in us, and eternal. How else should the recital of that which we know in a waking sense to be false come to affect us at all? Is it that we naturally conceive terror from such objects, considered in their capacity of being able to inflict upon us bodily injury? O, least of all! These terrors are of older standing. They date beyond body—or without the body, they would have been the same. . . . That the kind of fear here treated is purely spiritual—that it is strong in proportion as it is objectless on earth, that it predominates in the period of our sinless infancy—are difficulties the solution of which might afford some probable insight into our ante-mundane condition, and a peep at least into the shadowland of pre-existence.”—Charles Lamb: “Witches and Other Night-Fears”I.When a traveller in north central Massachusetts takes the wrong fork at the junction of the Aylesbury pike just beyond Dean’s Corners he comes upon a lonely and curious country. The ground gets higher, and the brier-bordered stone walls press closer and closer against the ruts of the dusty, curving road. The trees of the frequent forest belts seem too large, and the wild weeds, brambles, and grasses attain a luxuriance not often found in settled regions. At the same time the planted fields appear singularly few and barren; while the sparsely scattered houses wear a surprisingly uniform aspect of age, squalor, and dilapidation. Without knowing why, one hesitates to ask directions from the gnarled, solitary figures spied now and then on crumbling doorsteps or on the sloping, rock-strown meadows. Those figures are so silent and furtive that one feels somehow confronted by forbidden things, with which it would be better to have nothing to do. When a rise in the road brings the mountains in view above the deep woods, the feeling of strange uneasiness is increased. The summits are too rounded and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness, and sometimes the sky silhouettes with especial clearness the queer circles of tall stone pillars with which most of them are crowned.      Gorges and ravines of problematical depth intersect the way, and the crude wooden bridges always seem of dubious safety. When the road dips again there are stretches of marshland that one instinctively dislikes, and indeed almost fears at evening when unseen whippoorwills chatter and the fireflies come out in abnormal profusion to dance to the raucous, creepily insistent rhythms of stridently piping bull-frogs. The thin, shining line of the Miskatonic’s upper reaches has an oddly serpent-like suggestion as it winds close to the feet of the domed hills among which it rises.       As the hills draw nearer, one heeds their wooded sides more than their stone-crowned tops. Those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously that one wishes they would keep their distance, but there is no road by which to escape them. Across a covered bridge one sees a small village huddled between the stream and the vertical slope of Round Mountain, and wonders at the cluster of rotting gambrel roofs bespeaking an earlier architectural period than that of the neighbouring region. It is not reassuring to see, on a closer glance, that most of the houses are deserted and falling to ruin, and that the broken-steepled church now harbours the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet. One dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge, yet there is no way to avoid it. Once across, it is hard to prevent the impression of a faint, malign odour about the village street, as of the massed mould and decay of centuries. It is always a relief to get clear of the place, and to follow the narrow road around the base of the hills and across the level country beyond till it rejoins the Aylesbury pike. Afterward one sometimes learns that one has been through Dunwich.      Outsiders visit Dunwich as seldom as possible, and since a certain season of horror all the signboards pointing toward it have been taken down. The scenery, judged by any ordinary aesthetic canon, is more than commonly beautiful; yet there is no influx of artists or summer tourists. Two centuries ago, when talk of witch-blood, Satan-worship, and strange forest presences was not laughed at, it was the custom to give reasons for avoiding the locality. In our sensible age—since the Dunwich horror of 1928 was hushed up by those who had the town’s and the world’s welfare at heart—people shun it without knowing exactly why. Perhaps one reason—though it cannot apply to uninformed strangers—is that the natives are now repellently decadent, having gone far along that path of retrogression so common in many New England backwaters. They have come to form a race by themselves, with the well-defined mental and physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding. The average of their intelligence is woefully low, whilst their annals reek of overt viciousness and of half-hidden murders, incests, and deeds of almost unnamable violence and perversity. The old gentry, representing the two or three armigerous families which came from Salem in 1692, have kept somewhat above the general level of decay; though many branches are sunk into the sordid populace so deeply that only their names remain as a key to the origin they disgrace. Some of the Whateleys and Bishops still send their eldest sons to Harvard and Miskatonic, though those sons seldom return to the mouldering gambrel roofs under which they and their ancestors were born.      No one, even those who have the facts concerning the recent horror, can say just what is the matter with Dunwich; though old legends speak of unhallowed rites and conclaves of the Indians, amidst which they called forbidden shapes of shadow out of the great rounded hills, and made wild orgiastic prayers that were answered by loud crackings and rumblings from the ground below. In 1747 the Reverend Abijah Hoadley, newly come to the Congregational Church at Dunwich Village, preached a memorable sermon on the close presence of Satan and his imps; in which he said:      “It must be allow’d, that these Blasphemies of an infernall Train of Daemons are Matters of too common Knowledge to be deny’d; the cursed Voices of Azazel and Buzrael, of Beelzebub and Belial, being heard now from under Ground by above a Score of credible Witnesses now living. I my self did not more than a Fortnight ago catch a very plain Discourse of evill Powers in the Hill behind my House; wherein there were a Rattling and Rolling, Groaning, Screeching, and Hissing, such as no Things of this Earth cou’d raise up, and which must needs have come from those Caves that only black Magick can discover, and only the Divell unlock.”      Mr. Hoadley disappeared soon after delivering this sermon; but the text, printed in Springfield, is still extant. Noises in the hills continued to be reported from year to year, and still form a puzzle to geologists and physiographers.      Other traditions tell of foul odours near the hill-crowning circles of stone pillars, and of rushing airy presences to be heard faintly at certain hours from stated points at the bottom of the great ravines; while still others try to explain the Devil’s Hop Yard—a bleak, blasted hillside where no tree, shrub, or grass-blade will grow. Then too, the natives are mortally afraid of the numerous whippoorwills which grow vocal on warm nights. It is vowed that the birds are psychopomps lying in wait for the souls of the dying, and that they time their eerie cries in unison with the sufferer’s struggling breath. If they can catch the fleeing soul when it leaves the body, they instantly flutter away chittering in daemoniac laughter; but if they fail, they subside gradually into a disappointed silence.      These tales, of course, are obsolete and ridiculous; because they come down from very old times. Dunwich is indeed ridiculously old—older by far than any of the communities within thirty miles of it. South of the village one may still spy the cellar walls and chimney of the ancient Bishop house, which was built before 1700; whilst the ruins of the mill at the falls, built in 1806, form the most modern piece of architecture to be seen. Industry did not flourish here, and the nineteenth-century factory movement proved short-lived. Oldest of all are the great rings of rough-hewn stone columns on the hill-tops, but these are more generally attributed to the Indians than to the settlers. Deposits of skulls and bones, found within these circles and around the sizeable table-like rock on Sentinel Hill, sustain the popular belief that such spots were once the burial-places of the Pocumtucks; even though many ethnologists, disregarding the absurd improbability of such a theory, persist in believing the remains Caucasian."]}
{"id": "EN091", "pair": ["III. A Search and an Evocation1.Charles Ward, as we have seen, first learned in 1918 of his descent from Joseph Curwen. That he at once took an intense interest in everything pertaining to the bygone mystery is not to be wondered at; for every vague rumour that he had heard of Curwen now became something vital to himself, in whom flowed Curwens blood. No spirited and imaginative genealogist could have done otherwise than begin forthwith an avid and systematic collection of Curwen data.      In his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at secrecy; so that even Dr. Lyman hesitates to date the youths madness from any period before the close of 1919. He talked freely with his family - though his mother was not particularly pleased to own an ancestor like Curwen - and with the officials of the various museums and libraries he visited. In applying to private families for records thought to be in their possession he made no concealment of his object, and shared the somewhat amused scepticism with which the accounts of the old diarists and letter-writers were regarded. He often expressed a keen wonder as to what really had taken place a century and a half before at that Pawtuxet farmhouse whose site he vainly tried to find, and what Joseph Curwen really had been.      When he came across the Smith diary and archives and encountered the letter from Jedediah Orne he decided to visit Salem and look up Curwens early activities and connexions there, which he did during the Easter vacation of 1919. At the Essex Institute, which was well known to him from former sojourns in the glamorous old town of crumbling Puritan gables and clustered gambrel roofs, he was very kindly received, and unearthed there a considerable amount of Curwen data. He found that his ancestor was born in Salem-Village, now Danvers, seven miles from town, on the eighteenth of February (O.S.) 1662-3; and that he had run away to sea at the age of fifteen, not appearing again for nine years, when he returned with the speech, dress, and manners of a native Englishman and settled in Salem proper. At that time he had little to do with his family, but spent most of his hours with the curious books he had brought from Europe, and the strange chemicals which came for him on ships from England, France, and Holland. Certain trips of his into the country were the objects of much local inquisitiveness, and were whisperingly associated with vague rumours of fires on the hills at night.      Curwens only close friends had been one Edward Hutchinson of Salem-Village and one Simon Orne of Salem. With these men he was often seen in conference about the Common, and visits among them were by no means infrequent. Hutchinson had a house well out toward the woods, and it was not altogether liked by sensitive people because of the sounds heard there at night. He was said to entertain strange visitors, and the lights seen from his windows were not always of the same colour. The knowledge he displayed concerning long-dead persons and long-forgotten events was considered distinctly unwholesome, and he disappeared about the time the witchcraft panic began, never to be heard from again. At that time Joseph Curwen also departed, but his settlement in Providence was soon learned of. Simon Orne lived in Salem until 1720, when his failure to grow visibly old began to excite attention. He thereafter disappeared, though thirty years later his precise counterpart and self-styled son turned up to claim his property. The claim was allowed on the strength of documents in Simon Ornes known hand, and Jedediah Orne continued to dwell in Salem till 1771, when certain letters from Providence citizens to the Rev. Thomas Barnard and others brought about his quiet removal to parts unknown.      Certain documents by and about all of these strange characters were available at the Essex Institute, the Court House, and the Registry of Deeds, and included both harmless commonplaces such as land titles and bills of sale, and furtive fragments of a more provocative nature. There were four or five unmistakable allusions to them on the witchcraft trial records; as when one Hepzibah Lawson swore on July 10, 1692, at the Court of Oyer and Terminer under Judge Hathorne, that fortie Witches and the Blacke Man were wont to meete in the Woodes behind Mr. Hutchinsons house, and one Amity How declared at a session of August 8th before Judge Gedney that Mr. G. B. (Rev. George Burroughs) on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B. Then there was a catalogue of Hutchinsons uncanny library as found after his disappearance, and an unfinished manuscript in his handwriting, couched in a cipher none could read. Ward had a photostatic copy of this manuscript made, and began to work casually on the cipher as soon as it was delivered to him. After the following August his labours on the cipher became intense and feverish, and there is reason to believe from his speech and conduct that he hit upon the key before October or November. He never stated, though, whether or not he had succeeded.      But of the greatest immediate interest was the Orne material. It took Ward only a short time to prove from identity of penmanship a thing he had already considered established from the text of the letter to Curwen; namely, that Simon Orne and his supposed son were one and the same person. As Orne had said to his correspondent, it was hardly safe to live too long in Salem, hence he resorted to a thirty-year sojourn abroad, and did not return to claim his lands except as a representative of a new generation. Orne had apparently been careful to destroy most of his correspondence, but the citizens who took action in 1771 found and preserved a few letters and papers which excited their wonder. There were cryptic formulae and diagrams in his and other hands which Ward now either copied with care or had photographed, and one extremely mysterious letter in a chirography that the searcher recognised from items in the Registry of Deeds as positively Joseph Curwens.      This Curwen letter, though undated as to the year, was evidently not the one in answer to which Orne had written the confiscated missive; and from internal evidence Ward placed it not much later than 1750. It may not be amiss to give the text in full, as a sample of the style of one whose history was so dark and terrible. The recipient is addressed as \"Simon\", but a line (whether drawn by Curwen or Orne Ward could not tell) is run through the word.Prouidence, I.

This letter, oddly enough, was what first gave Ward the exact location of Curwens Providence home; for none of the records encountered up to that time had been at all specific. The discovery was doubly striking because it indicated as the newer Curwen house built in 1761 on the site of the old, a dilapidated building still standing in Olney Court and well known to Ward in his antiquarian rambles over Stampers Hill. The place was indeed only a few squares from his own home on the great hills higher ground, and was now the abode of a negro family much esteemed for occasional washing, housecleaning, and furnace-tending services. To find, in distant Salem, such sudden proof of the significance of this familiar rookery in his own family history, was a highly impressive thing to Ward; and he resolved to explore the place immediately upon his return. The more mystical phases of the letter, which he took to be some extravagant kind of symbolism, frankly baffled him; though he noted with a thrill of curiosity that the Biblical passage referred to - Job 14, 14 - was the familiar verse, \"If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.\"2.      Young Ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement, and spent the following Saturday in a long and exhaustive study of the house in Olney Court. The place, now crumbling with age, had never been a mansion; but was a modest two-and-a-half story wooden town house of the familiar Providence colonial type, with plain peaked roof, large central chimney, and artistically carved doorway with rayed fanlight, triangular pediment, and trim Doric pilasters. It had suffered but little alteration externally, and Ward felt he was gazing on something very close to the sinister matters of his quest.      The present negro inhabitants were known to him, and he was very courteously shewn about the interior by old Asa and his stout wife Hannah. Here there was more change than the outside indicated, and Ward saw with regret that fully half of the fine scroll-and-urn overmantels and shell-carved cupboard linings were gone, whilst much of the fine wainscotting and bolection moulding was marked, hacked, and gouged, or covered up altogether with cheap wall-paper. In general, the survey did not yield as much as Ward had somehow expected; but it was at least exciting to stand within the ancestral walls which had housed such a man of horror as Joseph Curwen. He saw with a thrill that a monogram had been very carefully effaced from the ancient brass knocker.      From then until after the close of school Ward spent his time on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local Curwen data. The former still proved unyielding; but of the latter he obtained so much, and so many clues to similar data elsewhere, that he was ready by July to make a trip to New London and New York to consult old letters whose presence in those places was indicated. This trip was very fruitful, for it brought him the Fenner letters with their terrible description of the Pawtuxet farmhouse raid, and the Nightingale-Talbot letters in which he learned of the portrait painted on a panel of the Curwen library. This matter of the portrait interested him particularly, since he would have given much to know just what Joseph Curwen looked like; and he decided to make a second search of the house in Olney Court to see if there might not be some trace of the ancient features beneath peeling coats of later paint or layers of mouldy wall-paper.      Early in August that search took place, and Ward went carefully over the walls of every room sizeable enough to have been by any possibility the library of the evil builder. He paid especial attention to the large panels of such overmantels as still remained; and was keenly excited after about an hour, when on a broad area above the fireplace in a spacious ground-floor room he became certain that the surface brought out by the peeling of several coats of paint was sensibly darker than any ordinary interior paint or the wood beneath it was likely to have been. A few more careful tests with a thin knife, and he knew that he had come upon an oil portrait of great extent. With truly scholarly restraint the youth did not risk the damage which an immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture with the knife might have done, but just retired from the scene of his discovery to enlist expert help. In three days he returned with an artist of long experience, Mr. Walter C. Dwight, whose studio is near the foot of College Hill; and that accomplished restorer of paintings set to work at once with proper methods and chemical substances. Old Asa and his wife were duly excited over their strange visitors, and were properly reimbursed for this invasion of their domestic hearth.      As day by day the work of restoration progressed, Charles Ward looked on with growing interest at the lines and shades gradually unveiled after their long oblivion. Dwight had begun at the bottom; hence since the picture was a three-quarter-length one, the face did not come out for some time. It was meanwhile seen that the subject was a spare, well-shaped man with dark-blue coat, embroidered waistcoat, black satin small-clothes, and white silk stockings, seated in a carved chair against the background of a window with wharves and ships beyond. When the head came out it was observed to bear a neat Albemarle wig, and to possess a thin, calm, undistinguished face which seemed somehow familiar to both Ward and the artist. Only at the very last, though, did the restorer and his client begin to gasp with astonishment at the details of that lean, pallid visage, and to recognise with a touch of awe the dramatic trick which heredity had played. For it took the final bath of oil and the final stroke of the delicate scraper to bring out fully the expression which centuries had hidden; and to confront the bewildered Charles Dexter Ward, dweller in the past, with his own living features in the countenance of his horrible great-great-great-grandfather.      Ward brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered, and his father at once determined to purchase the picture despite its execution on stationary panelling. The resemblance to the boy, despite an appearance of rather greater age, was marvellous; and it could be seen that through some trick of atavism the physical contours of Joseph Curwen had found precise duplication after a century and a half. Mrs. Wards resemblance to her ancestor was not at all marked, though she could recall relatives who had some of the facial characteristics shared by her son and by the bygone Curwen. She did not relish the discovery, and told her husband that he had better burn the picture instead of bringing it home. There was, she averred, something unwholesome about it; not only intrinsically, but in its very resemblance to Charles. Mr. Ward, however, was a practical man of power and affairs - a cotton manufacturer with extensive mills at Riverpoint in the Pawtuxet Valley - and not one to listen to feminine scruples. The picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to his son, and he believed the boy deserved it as a present. In this opinion, it is needless to say, Charles most heartily concurred; and a few days later Mr. Ward located the owner of the house - a small rodent-featured person with a guttural accent - and obtained the whole mantel and overmantel bearing the picture at a curtly fixed priced which cut short the impending torrent of unctuous haggling.      It now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the Ward home, where provisions were made for its thorough restoration and installation with an electric mock-fireplace in Charless third-floor study or library. To Charles was left the task of superintending this removal, and on the twenty-eighth of August he accompanied two expert workmen from the Crooker decorating firm to the house in Olney Court, where the mantel and portrait-bearing overmantel were detached with great care and precision for transportation in the companys motor truck. There was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the chimneys course, and in this young Ward observed a cubical recess about a foot square, which must have lain directly behind the head of the portrait. Curious as to what such a space might mean or contain, the youth approached and looked within; finding beneath the deep coatings of dust and soot some loose yellowed papers, a crude, thick copybook, and a few mouldering textile shreds which may have formed the ribbon binding the rest together. Blowing away the bulk of the dirt and cinders, he took up the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover. It was in a hand which he had learned to recognise at the Essex Institute, and proclaimed the volume as the \"Journall and Notes of Jos: Curwen, Gent., of Providence-Plantations, Late of Salem.\"      Excited beyond measure by his discovery, Ward shewed the book to the two curious workmen beside him. Their testimony is absolute as to the nature and genuineness of the finding, and Dr. Willett relies on them to help establish his theory that the youth was not mad when he began his major eccentricities. All the other papers were likewise in Curwens handwriting, and one of them seemed especially portentous because of its inscription: \"To Him Who Shal Come After, & How He May Gett Beyonde Time & ye Spheres.\" Another was in a cipher; the same, Ward hoped, as the Hutchinson cipher which had hitherto baffled him. A third, and here the searcher rejoiced, seemed to be a key to the cipher; whilst the fourth and fifth were addressed respectively to \"Edw: Hutchinson, Armiger\" and \"Jedediah Orne, Esq.\", or Their Heir or Heirs, or Those Representg Them. The sixth and last was inscribed: \"Joseph Curwen his Life and Travells Betn ye yeares 1678 and 1687: Of Whither He Voyagd, Where He Stayd, Whom He Sawe, and What He Learnt.\"3.      We have now reached the point from which the more academic school of alienists date Charles Wards madness. Upon his discovery the youth had looked immediately at a few of the inner pages of the book and manuscripts, and had evidently seen something which impressed him tremendously. Indeed, in shewing the titles to the workmen he appeared to guard the text itself with peculiar care, and to labour under a perturbation for which even the antiquarian and genealogical significance of the find could hardly account. Upon returning home he broke the news with an almost embarrassed air, as if he wished to convey an idea of its supreme importance without having to exhibit the evidence itself. He did not even shew the titles to his parents, but simply told them that he had found some documents in Joseph Curwens handwriting, \"mostly in cipher\", which would have to be studied very carefully before yielding up their true meaning. It is unlikely that he would have shewn what he did to the workmen, had it not been for their unconcealed curiosity. As it was he doubtless wished to avoid any display of peculiar reticence which would increase their discussion of the matter.      That night Charles Ward sat up in his room reading the new-found book and papers, and when day came he did not desist. His meals, on his urgent request when his mother called to see what was amiss, were sent up to him; and in the afternoon he appeared only briefly when the men came to install the Curwen picture and mantelpiece in his study. The next night he slept in snatches in his clothes, meanwhile wrestling feverishly with the unravelling of the cipher manuscript. In the morning his mother saw that he was at work on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher, which he had frequently shewn her before; but in response to her query he said that the Curwen key could not be applied to it. That afternoon he abandoned his work and watched the men fascinatedly as they finished their installation of the picture with its woodwork above a cleverly realistic electric log, setting the mock-fireplace and overmantel a little out from the north wall as if a chimney existed, and boxing in the sides with panelling to match the rooms. The front panel holding the picture was sawn and hinged to allow cupboard space behind it. After the workmen went he moved his work into the study and sat down before it with his eyes half on the cipher and half on the portrait which stared back at him like a year-adding and century-recalling mirror.      His parents, subsequently recalling his conduct at this period, give interesting details anent the policy of concealment which he practiced. Before servants he seldom hid any paper which he might be studying, since he rightly assumed that Curwens intricate and archaic chirography would be too much for them. With his parents, however, he was more circumspect; and unless the manuscript in question were a cipher, or a mere mass of cryptic symbols and unknown ideographs (as that entitled \"To Him Who Shal Come After etc.\" seemed to be), he would cover it with some convenient paper until his caller had departed. At night he kept the papers under lock and key in an antique cabinet of his, where he also placed them whenever he left the room. He soon resumed fairly regular hours and habits, except that his long walks and other outside interests seemed to cease. The opening of school, where he now began his senior year, seemed a great bore to him; and he frequently asserted his determination never to bother with college. He had, he said, important special investigations to make, which would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and the humanities than any university which the world could boast.      Naturally, only one who had always been more or less studious, eccentric, and solitary could have pursued this course for many days without attracting notice. Ward, however, was constitutionally a scholar and a hermit; hence his parents were less surprised than regretful at the close confinement and secrecy he adopted. At the same time, both his father and mother thought it odd that he would shew them no scrap of his treasure-trove, nor give any connected account of such data as he had deciphered. This reticence he explained away as due to a wish to wait until he might announce some connected revelation, but as the weeks passed without further disclosures there began to grow up between the youth and his family a kind of constraint; intensified in his mothers case by her manifest disapproval of all Curwen delvings.      During October Ward began visiting the libraries again, but no longer for the antiquarian matter of his former days. Witchcraft and magic, occultism and daemonology, were what he sought now; and when Providence sources proved unfruitful he would take the train for Boston and tap the wealth of the great library in Copley Square, the Widener Library at Harvard, or the Zion Research Library in Brookline, where certain rare works on Biblical subjects are available. He bought extensively, and fitted up a whole additional set of shelves in his study for newly acquired works on uncanny subjects; while during the Christmas holidays he made a round of out-of-town trips including one to Salem to consult certain records at the Essex Institute.      About the middle of January, 1920, there entered Wards bearing an element of triumph which he did not explain, and he was no more found at work upon the Hutchinson cipher. Instead, he inaugurated a dual policy of chemical research and record-scanning; fitting up for the one a laboratory in the unused attic of the house, and for the latter haunting all the sources of vital statistics in Providence. Local dealers in drugs and scientific supplies, later questioned, gave astonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and instruments he purchased; but clerks at the State House, the City Hall, and the various libraries agree as to the definite object of his second interest. He was searching intensely and feverishly for the grave of Joseph Curwen, from whose slate slab an older generation had so wisely blotted the name.      Little by little there grew upon the Ward family the conviction that something was wrong. Charles had had freaks and changes of minor interests before, but this growing secrecy and absorption in strange pursuits was unlike even him. His school work was the merest pretence; and although he failed in no test, it could be seen that the old application had all vanished. He had other concernments now; and when not in his new laboratory with a score of obsolete alchemical books, could be found either poring over old burial records down town or glued to his volumes of occult lore in his study, where the startlingly - one almost fancied increasingly - similar features of Joseph Curwen stared blandly at him from the great overmantel on the north wall.      Late in March Ward added to his archive-searching a ghoulish series of rambles about the various ancient cemeteries of the city. The cause appeared later, when it was learned from City Hall clerks that he had probably found an important clue. His quest had suddenly shifted from the grave of Joseph Curwen to that of one Naphthali Field; and this shift was explained when, upon going over the files that he had been over, the investigators actually found a fragmentary record of Curwens burial which had escaped the general obliteration, and which stated that the curious leaden coffin had been interred \"10 ft. S. and 5 ft. W. of Naphthali Fields grave in ye - \". The lack of a specified burying-ground in the surviving entry greatly complicated the search, and Naphthali Fields grave seemed as elusive as that of Curwen; but here no systematic effacement had existed, and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on the stone itself even if its record had perished. Hence the rambles - from which St. Johns (the former Kings) Churchyard and the ancient Congregational burying-ground in the midst of Swan Point Cemetery were excluded, since other statistics had shewn that the only Naphthali Field (obiit 1729) whose grave could have been meant had been a Baptist.4.      It was toward May when Dr. Willett, at the request of the senior Ward, and fortified with all the Curwen data which the family had gleaned from Charles in his non-secretive days, talked with the young man. The interview was of little value or conclusiveness, for Willett felt at every moment that Charles was thoroughly master of himself and in touch with matters of real importance; but it at least forced the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanour. Of a pallid, impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment, Ward seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits, though not to reveal their object. He stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early scientific knowledge, for the most part in cipher, of an apparent scope comparable only to the discoveries of Friar Bacon and perhaps surpassing even those. They were, however, meaningless except when correlated with a body of learning now wholly obsolete; so that their immediate presentation to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all impressiveness and dramatic significance. To take their vivid place in the history of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of which they evolved, and to this task of correlation Ward was now devoting himself. He was seeking to acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of the Curwen data must possess, and hoped in time to make a full announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to the world of thought. Not even Einstein, he declared, could more profoundly revolutionise the current conception of things.      As to his graveyard search, whose object he freely admitted, but the details of whose progress he did not relate, he said he had reason to think that Joseph Curwens mutilated headstone bore certain mystic symbols - carved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by those who had effaced the name - which were absolutely essential to the final solution of his cryptic system. Curwen, he believed, had wished to guard his secret with care; and had consequently distributed the data in an exceedingly curious fashion. When Dr. Willett asked to see the mystic documents, Ward displayed much reluctance and tried to put him off with such things as photostatic copies of the Hutchinson cipher and Orne formulae and diagrams; but finally shewed him the exteriors of some of the real Curwen finds - the \"Journall and Notes\", the cipher (title in cipher also), and the formula-filled message \"To Him Who Shal Come After\" - and let him glance inside such as were in obscure characters.      He also opened the diary at a page carefully selected for its innocuousness and gave Willett a glimpse of Curwens connected handwriting in English. The doctor noted very closely the crabbed and complicated letters, and the general aura of the seventeenth century which clung round both penmanship and style despite the writers survival into the eighteenth century, and became quickly certain that the document was genuine. The text itself was relatively trivial, and Willett recalled only a fragment:\"Wedn. 16 Octr. 1754. My Sloope the Wakeful this Day putt in from London with XX newe Men pickd up in ye Indies, Spaniards from Martineco and 2 Dutch Men from Surinam.

Simon hath not Writ these V. Weekes, but I expecte soon hearg from him.\"      When upon reaching this point Dr. Willett turned the leaf he was quickly checked by Ward, who almost snatched the book from his grasp. All that the doctor had a chance to see on the newly opened page was a brief pair of sentences; but these, strangely enough, lingered tenaciously in his memory. They ran: \"Ye Verse from Liber-Damnatus beg spoke V Roodmasses and IV Hallows-Eves, I am Hopeful ye Thing is breedg Outside ye Spheres. It will drawe One who is to Come, if I can make sure he shal bee, and he shall think on Past thinges and look back thro all ye yeares, against ye which I must have ready ye Saltes or That to make em with.\"      Willett saw no more, but somehow this small glimpse gave a new and vague terror to the painted features of Joseph Curwen which stared blandly down from the overmantel. Ever after that he entertained the odd fancy - which his medical skill of course assured him was only a fancy - that the eyes of the portrait had a sort of wish, if not an actual tendency, to follow young Charles Ward as he moved about the room. He stopped before leaving to study the picture closely, marvelling at its resemblance to Charles and memorising every minute detail of the cryptical, colourless face, even down to a slight scar or pit in the smooth brow above the right eye. Cosmo Alexander, he decided, was a painter worthy of the Scotland that produced Raeburn, and a teacher worthy of his illustrious pupil Gilbert Stuart.      Assured by the doctor that Charless mental health was in no danger, but that on the other hand he was engaged in researches which might prove of real importance, the Wards were more lenient than they might otherwise have been when during the following June the youth made positive his refusal to attend college. He had, he declared, studies of much more vital importance to pursue; and intimated a wish to go abroad the following year in order to avail himself of certain sources of data not existing in America. The senior Ward, while denying this latter wish as absurd for a boy of only eighteen, acquiesced regarding the university; so that after a none too brilliant graduation from the Moses Brown School there ensued for Charles a three-year period of intensive occult study and graveyard searching. He became recognised as an eccentric, and dropped even more completely from the sight of his familys friends than he had been before; keeping close to his work and only occasionally making trips to other cities to consult obscure records. Once he went south to talk with a strange old mulatto who dwelt in a swamp and about whom a newspaper had printed a curious article. Again he sought a small village in the Adirondacks whence reports of certain odd ceremonial practices had come. But still his parents forbade him the trip to the Old World which he desired.      Coming of age in April, 1923, and having previously inherited a small competence from his maternal grandfather, Ward determined at last to take the European trip hitherto denied him. Of his proposed itinerary he would say nothing save that the needs of his studies would carry him to many places, but he promised to write his parents fully and faithfully. When they saw he could not be dissuaded, they ceased all opposition and helped as best they could; so that in June the young man sailed for Liverpool with the farewell blessings of his father and mother, who accompanied him to Boston and waved him out of sight from the White Star pier in Charlestown. Letters soon told of his safe arrival, and of his securing good quarters in Great Russell Street, London; where he proposed to stay, shunning all family friends, till he had exhausted the resources of the British Museum in a certain direction. Of his daily life he wrote but little, for there was little to write. Study and experiment consumed all his time, and he mentioned a laboratory which he had established in one of his rooms. That he said nothing of antiquarian rambles in the glamorous old city with its luring skyline of ancient domes and steeples and its tangles of roads and alleys whose mystic convolutions and sudden vistas alternately beckon and surprise, was taken by his parents as a good index of the degree to which his new interests had engrossed his mind.      In June, 1924, a brief note told of his departure for Paris, to which he had before made one or two flying trips for material in the Bibliothque Nationale. For three months thereafter he sent only postal cards, giving an address in the Rue St. Jacques and referring to a special search among rare manuscripts in the library of an unnamed private collector. He avoided acquaintances, and no tourists brought back reports of having seen him. Then came a silence, and in October the Wards received a picture card from Prague, Czecho-Slovakia, stating that Charles was in that ancient town for the purpose of conferring with a certain very aged man supposed to be the last living possessor of some very curious mediaeval information. He gave an address in the Neustadt, and announced no move till the following January; when he dropped several cards from Vienna telling of his passage through that city on the way toward a more easterly region whither one of his correspondents and fellow-delvers into the occult had invited him.      The next card was from Klausenburg in Transylvania, and told of Wards progress toward his destination. He was going to visit a Baron Ferenczy, whose estate lay in the mountains east of Rakus; and was to be addressed at Rakus in the care of that nobleman. Another card from Rakus a week later, saying that his hosts carriage had met him and that he was leaving the village for the mountains, was his last message for a considerable time; indeed, he did not reply to his parents frequent letters until May, when he wrote to discourage the plan of his mother for a meeting in London, Paris, or Rome during the summer, when the elder Wards were planning to travel in Europe. His researches, he said, were such that he could not leave his present quarters; while the situation of Baron Ferenczys castle did not favour visits. It was on a crag in the dark wooded mountains, and the region was so shunned by the country folk that normal people could not help feeling ill at ease. Moreover, the Baron was not a person likely to appeal to correct and conservative New England gentlefolk. His aspect and manners had idiosyncrasies, and his age was so great as to be disquieting. It would be better, Charles said, if his parents would wait for his return to Providence; which could scarcely be far distant.      That return did not, however, take place until May, 1926, when after a few heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into New York on the Homeric and traversed the long miles to Providence by motor-coach, eagerly drinking in the green rolling hills, the fragrant, blossoming orchards, and the white steepled towns of vernal Connecticut; his first taste of ancient New England in nearly four years. When the coach crossed the Pawcatuck and entered Rhode Island amidst the faery goldenness of a late spring afternoon his heart beat with quickened force, and the entry to Providence along Reservoir and Elmwood avenues was a breathless and wonderful thing despite the depths of forbidden lore to which he had delved. At the high square where Broad, Weybosset, and Empire Streets join, he saw before and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant, remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town; and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down the terminal behind the Biltmore, bringing into view the great dome and soft, roof-pierced greenery of the ancient hill across the river, and the tall colonial spire of the First Baptist Church limned pink in the magic evening light against the fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous background.      Old Providence! It was this place and the mysterious forces of its long, continuous history which had brought him into being, and which had drawn him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no prophet might fix. Here lay the arcana, wondrous or dreadful as the case might be, for which all his years of travel and application had been preparing him. A taxicab whirled him through Post Office Square with its glimpse of the river, the old Market House, and the head of the bay, and up the steep curved slope of Waterman Street to Prospect, where the vast gleaming dome and sunset-flushed Ionic columns of the Christian Science Church beckoned northward. Then eight squares past the fine old estates his childish eyes had known, and the quaint brick sidewalks so often trodden by his youthful feet. And at last the little white overtaken farmhouse on the right, on the left the classic Adam porch and stately bayed facade of the great brick house where he was born. It was twilight, and Charles Dexter Ward had come home.5.      A school of alienists slightly less academic than Dr. Lymans assign to Wards European trip the beginning of his true madness. Admitting that he was sane when he started, they believe that his conduct upon returning implies a disastrous change. But even to this claim Dr. Willett refuses to accede. There was, he insists, something later; and the queernesses of the youth at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroad - odd enough things, to be sure, but by no means implying mental aberration on the part of their celebrant. Ward himself, though visibly aged and hardened, was still normal in his general reactions; and in several talks with Willett displayed a balance which no madman - even an incipient one - could feign continuously for long. What elicited the notion of insanity at this period were the sounds heard at all hours from Wards attic laboratory, in which he kept himself most of the time. There were chantings and repetitions, and thunderous declamations in uncanny rhythms; and although these sounds were always in Wards own voice, there was something in the quality of that voice, and in the accents of the formulae it pronounced, which could not but chill the blood of every hearer. It was noticed that Nig, the venerable and beloved black cat of the household, bristled and arched his back perceptibly when certain of the tones were heard.      The odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise exceedingly strange. Sometimes they were very noxious, but more often they were aromatic, with a haunting, elusive quality which seemed to have the power of inducing fantastic images. People who smelled them had a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas, with strange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite distance. Ward did not resume his old-time rambles, but applied himself diligently to the strange books he had brought home, and to equally strange delvings within his quarters; explaining that European sources had greatly enlarged the possibilities of his work, and promising great revelations in the years to come. His older aspect increased to a startling degree his resemblance to the Curwen portrait in his library; and Dr. Willett would often pause by the latter after a call, marvelling at the virtual identity, and reflecting that only the small pit above the pictures right eye now remained to differentiate the long-dead wizard from the living youth. These calls of Willetts, undertaken at the request of the senior Wards, were curious affairs. Ward at no time repulsed the doctor, but the latter saw that he could never reach the young mans inner psychology. Frequently he noted peculiar things about; little wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables, and the half-erased remnants of circles, triangles, and pentagrams in chalk or charcoal on the cleared central space of the large room. And always in the night those rhythms and incantations thundered, till it became very difficult to keep servants or suppress furtive talk of Charless madness.      In January, 1927, a peculiar incident occurred. One night about midnight, as Charles was chanting a ritual whose weird cadence echoed unpleasantly through the house below, there came a sudden gust of chill wind from the bay, and a faint, obscure trembling of the earth which everyone in the neighbourhood noted. At the same time the cat exhibited phenomenal traces of fright, while dogs bayed for as much as a mile around. This was the prelude to a sharp thunderstorm, anomalous for the season, which brought with it such a crash that Mr. and Mrs. Ward believed the house had been struck. They rushed upstairs to see what damage had been done, but Charles met them at the door to the attic; pale, resolute, and portentous, with an almost fearsome combination of triumph and seriousness on his face. He assured them that the house had not really been struck, and that the storm would soon be over. They paused, and looking through a window saw that he was indeed right; for the lightning flashed farther and farther off, whilst the trees ceased to bend in the strange frigid gust from the water. The thunder sank to a sort of dull mumbling chuckle and finally died away. Stars came out, and the stamp of triumph on Charles Wards face crystallised into a very singular expression.      For two months or more after this incident Ward was less confined than usual to his laboratory. He exhibited a curious interest in the weather, and made odd inquiries about the date of the spring thawing of the ground. One night late in March he left the house after midnight, and did not return till almost morning; when his mother, being wakeful, heard a rumbling motor draw up to the carriage entrance. Muffled oaths could be distinguished, and Mrs. Ward, rising and going to the window, saw four dark figures removing a long, heavy box from a truck at Charless direction and carrying it within by the side door. She heard laboured breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs, and finally a dull thumping in the attic; after which the footfalls descended again, and the four men reappeared outside and drove off in their truck.      The next day Charles resumed his strict attic seclusion, drawing down the dark shades of his laboratory windows and appearing to be working on some metal substance. He would open the door to no one, and steadfastly refused all proffered food. About noon a wrenching sound followed by a terrible cry and a fall were heard, but when Mrs. Ward rapped at the door her son at length answered faintly, and told her that nothing had gone amiss. The hideous and indescribable stench now welling out was absolutely harmless and unfortunately necessary. Solitude was the one prime essential, and he would appear later for dinner. That afternoon, after the conclusion of some odd hissing sounds which came from behind the locked portal, he did finally appear; wearing an extremely haggard aspect and forbidding anyone to enter the laboratory upon any pretext. This, indeed, proved the beginning of a new policy of secrecy; for never afterward was any other person permitted to visit either the mysterious garret workroom or the adjacent storeroom which he cleaned out, furnished roughly, and added to his inviolably private domain as a sleeping apartment. Here he lived, with books brought up from his library beneath, till the time he purchased the Pawtuxet bungalow and moved to it all his scientific effects.      In the evening Charles secured the paper before the rest of the family and damaged part of it through an apparent accident. Later on Dr. Willett, having fixed the date from statements by various members of the household, looked up an intact copy at the Journal office and found that in the destroyed section the following small item had occurred:Nocturnal Diggers Surprised inNorth Burial GroundRobert Hart, night watchman at the North Burial Ground, this morning discovered a party of several men with a motor truck in the oldest part of the cemetery, but apparently frightened them off before they had accomplished whatever their object may have been.      The discovery took place at about four oclock, when Harts attention was attracted by the sound of a motor outside his shelter. Investigating, he saw a large truck on the main drive several rods away; but could not reach it before the sound of his feet on the gravel had revealed his approach. The men hastily placed a large box in the truck and drove away toward the street before they could be overtaken; and since no known grave was disturbed, Hart believes that this box was an object which they wished to bury.      The diggers must have been at work for a long while before detection, for Hart found an enormous hole dug at a considerable distance back from the roadway in the lot of Amasa Field, where most of the old stones have long ago disappeared. The hole, a place as large and deep as a grave, was empty; and did not coincide with any interment mentioned in the cemetery records.      Sergt. Riley of the Second Station viewed the spot and gave the opinion that the hole was dug by bootleggers rather gruesomely and ingeniously seeking a safe cache for liquor in a place not likely to be disturbed. In reply to questions Hart said he thought the escaping truck had headed up Rochambeau Avenue, though he could not be sure.      During the next few days Ward was seldom seen by his family. Having added sleeping quarters to his attic realm, he kept closely to himself there, ordering food brought to the door and not taking it in until after the servant had gone away. The droning of monotonous formulae and the chanting of bizarre rhythms recurred at intervals, while at other times occasional listeners could detect the sound of tinkling glass, hissing chemicals, running water, or roaring gas flames. Odours of the most unplaceable quality, wholly unlike any before noted, hung at times around the door; and the air of tension observable in the young recluse whenever he did venture briefly forth was such as to excite the keenest speculation. Once he made a hasty trip to the Athenaeum for a book he required, and again he hired a messenger to fetch him a highly obscure volume from Boston. Suspense was written portentously over the whole situation, and both the family and Dr. Willett confessed themselves wholly at a loss what to do or think about it.6.      Then on the fifteenth of April a strange development occurred. While nothing appeared to grow different in kind, there was certainly a very terrible difference in degree; and Dr. Willett somehow attaches great significance to the change. The day was Good Friday, a circumstance of which the servants made much, but which others quite naturally dismiss as an irrelevant coincidence. Late in the afternoon young Ward began repeating a certain formula in a singularly loud voice, at the same time burning some substance so pungent that its fumes escaped over the entire house. The formula was so plainly audible in the hall outside the locked door that Mrs. Ward could not help memorising it as she waited and listened anxiously, and later on she was able to write it down at Dr. Willetts request. It ran as follows, and experts have told Dr. Willett that its very close analogue can be found in the mystic writings of \"Eliphas Levi\", that cryptic soul who crept through a crack in the forbidden door and glimpsed the frightful vistas of the void beyond:\"Per Adonai Eloim, Adonai Jehova,Adonai Sabaoth, Metraton On Agla Mathon,verbum pythonicum, mysterium salamandrae,conventus sylvorum, antra gnomorum,daemonia Coeli Gad, Almousin, Gibor, Jehosua,Evam, Zariatnatmik, veni, veni, veni.\"      This had been going on for two hours without change or intermission when over all the neighbourhood a pandaemoniac howling of dogs set in. The extent of this howling can be judged from the space it received in the papers the next day, but to those in the Ward household it was overshadowed by the odour which instantly followed it; a hideous, all-pervasive odour which none of them had ever smelt before or have ever smelt since. In the midst of this mephitic flood there came a very perceptible flash like that of lightning, which would have been blinding and impressive but for the daylight around; and then was heard the voice that no listener can ever forget because of its thunderous remoteness, its incredible depth, and its eldritch dissimilarity to Charles Wards voice. It shook the house, and was clearly heard by at least two neighbours above the howling of the dogs. Mrs. Ward, who had been listening in despair outside her sons locked laboratory, shivered as she recognised its hellish import; for Charles had told her of its evil fame in dark books, and of the manner in which it had thundered, according to the Fenner letters, above the doomed Pawtuxet farmhouse on the night of Joseph Curwens annihilation. There was no mistaking that nightmare phrase, for Charles had described it too vividly in the old days when he had talked frankly of his Curwen investigations. And yet it was only this fragment of an archaic and forgotten language: \"DIES MIES JESCHET BOENE DOESEF DOUVEMA ENITEMAUS\".      Close upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening of the daylight, though sunset was still an hour distant, and then a puff of added odour different from the first but equally unknown and intolerable. Charles was chanting again now and his mother could hear syllables that sounded like \"Yi-nash-Yog-Sothoth-he-lgeb-fi-throdog\" - ending in a \"Yah!\" whose maniacal force mounted in an ear-splitting crescendo. A second later all previous memories were effaced by the wailing scream which burst out with frantic explosiveness and gradually changed form to a paroxysm of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Mrs. Ward, with the mingled fear and blind courage of maternity, advanced and knocked affrightedly at the concealing panels, but obtained no sign of recognition. She knocked again, but paused nervelessly as a second shriek arose, this one unmistakably in the familiar voice of her son, and sounding concurrently with the still bursting cachinnations of that other voice. Presently she fainted, although she is still unable to recall the precise and immediate cause. Memory sometimes makes merciful deletions.      Mr. Ward returned from the business section at about quarter past six; and not finding his wife downstairs, was told by the frightened servants that she was probably watching at Charless door, from which the sounds had been far stranger than ever before. Mounting the stairs at once, he saw Mrs. Ward stretched at full length on the floor of the corridor outside the laboratory; and realising that she had fainted, hastened to fetch a glass of water from a set bowl in a neighbouring alcove. Dashing the cold fluid in her face, he was heartened to observe an immediate response on her part, and was watching the bewildered opening of her eyes when a chill shot through him and threatened to reduce him to the very state from which she was emerging. For the seemingly silent laboratory was not as silent as it had appeared to be, but held the murmurs of a tense, muffled conversation in tones too low for comprehension, yet of a quality profoundly disturbing to the soul.      It was not, of course, new for Charles to mutter formulae; but this muttering was definitely different. It was so palpably a dialogue, or imitation of a dialogue, with the regular alteration of inflections suggesting question and answer, statement and response. One voice was undisguisedly that of Charles, but the other had a depth and hollowness which the youths best powers of ceremonial mimicry had scarcely approached before. There was something hideous, blasphemous, and abnormal about it, and but for a cry from his recovering wife which cleared his mind by arousing his protective instincts it is not likely that Theodore Howland Ward could have maintained for nearly a year more his old boast that he had never fainted. As it was, he seized his wife in his arms and bore her quickly downstairs before she could notice the voices which had so horribly disturbed him. Even so, however, he was not quick enough to escape catching something himself which caused him to stagger dangerously with his burden. For Mrs. Wards cry had evidently been heard by others than he, and there had come from behind the locked door the first distinguishable words which that masked and terrible colloquy had yielded. They were merely an excited caution in Charless own voice, but somehow their implications held a nameless fright for the father who overheard them. The phrase was just this: \"Sshh! - write!\"      Mr. and Mrs. Ward conferred at some length after dinner, and the former resolved to have a firm and serious talk with Charles that very night. No matter how important the object, such conduct could no longer be permitted; for these latest developments transcended every limit of sanity and formed a menace to the order and nervous well-being of the entire household. The youth must indeed have taken complete leave of his senses, since only downright madness could have prompted the wild screams and imaginary conversations in assumed voices which the present day had brought forth. All this must be stopped, or Mrs. Ward would be made ill and the keeping of servants become an impossibility.      Mr. Ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for Charless laboratory. On the third floor, however, he paused at the sounds which he heard proceeding from the now disused library of his son. Books were apparently being flung about and papers wildly rustled, and upon stepping to the door Mr. Ward beheld the youth within, excitedly assembling a vast armful of literary matter of every size and shape. Charless aspect was very drawn and haggard, and he dropped his entire load with a start at the sound of his fathers voice. At the elder mans command he sat down, and for some time listened to the admonitions he had so long deserved. There was no scene. At the end of the lecture he agreed that his father was right, and that his noises, mutterings, incantations, and chemical odours were indeed inexcusable nuisances. He agreed to a policy of greater quiet, though insisting on a prolongation of his extreme privacy. Much of his future work, he said, was in any case purely book research; and he could obtain quarters elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be necessary at a later stage. For the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed the keenest contrition, and explained that the conversation later heard was part of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental atmosphere. His use of abstruse technical terms somewhat bewildered Mr. Ward, but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and poise despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity. The interview was really quite inconclusive, and as Charles picked up his armful and left the room Mr. Ward hardly knew what to make of the entire business. It was as mysterious as the death of poor old Nig, whose stiffening form had been found an hour before in the basement, with staring eyes and fear-distorted mouth.      Driven by some vague detective instinct, the bewildered parent now glanced curiously at the vacant shelves to see what his son had taken up to the attic. The youths library was plainly and rigidly classified, so that one might tell at a glance the books or at least the kind of books which had been withdrawn. On this occasion Mr. Ward was astonished to find that nothing of the occult or the antiquarian, beyond what had been previously removed, was missing. These new withdrawals were all modern items; histories, scientific treatises, geographies, manuals of literature, philosophic works, and certain contemporary newspapers and magazines. It was a very curious shift from Charles Wards recent run of reading, and the father paused in a growing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense of strangeness. The strangeness was a very poignant sensation, and almost clawed at his chest as he strove to see just what was wrong around him. Something was indeed wrong, and tangibly as well as spiritually so. Ever since he had been in this room he had known that something was amiss, and at last it dawned upon him what it was.      On the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the house in Olney Court, but to the cracked and precariously restored oils of the large Curwen portrait disaster had come. Time and unequal heating had done their work at last, and at some time since the rooms last cleaning the worst had happened. Peeling clear of the wood, curling tighter and tighter, and finally crumbling into small bits with what must have been malignly silent suddenness, the portrait of Joseph Curwen had resigned forever its staring surveillance of the youth it so strangely resembled, and now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust.", "II.It was in the township of Dunwich, in a large and partly inhabited farmhouse set against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile and a half from any other dwelling, that Wilbur Whateley was born at 5 A.M. on Sunday, the second of February, 1913. This date was recalled because it was Candlemas, which people in Dunwich curiously observe under another name; and because the noises in the hills had sounded, and all the dogs of the countryside had barked persistently, throughout the night before. Less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother was one of the decadent Whateleys, a somewhat deformed, unattractive albino woman of thirty-five, living with an aged and half-insane father about whom the most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered in his youth. Lavinia Whateley had no known husband, but according to the custom of the region made no attempt to disavow the child; concerning the other side of whose ancestry the country folk might—and did—speculate as widely as they chose. On the contrary, she seemed strangely proud of the dark, goatish-looking infant who formed such a contrast to her own sickly and pink-eyed albinism, and was heard to mutter many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous future.      Lavinia was one who would be apt to mutter such things, for she was a lone creature given to wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and trying to read the great odorous books which her father had inherited through two centuries of Whateleys, and which were fast falling to pieces with age and worm-holes. She had never been to school, but was filled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore that Old Whateley had taught her. The remote farmhouse had always been feared because of Old Whateley’s reputation for black magic, and the unexplained death by violence of Mrs. Whateley when Lavinia was twelve years old had not helped to make the place popular. Isolated among strange influences, Lavinia was fond of wild and grandiose day-dreams and singular occupations; nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares in a home from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since disappeared.      There was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises and the dogs’ barking on the night Wilbur was born, but no known doctor or midwife presided at his coming. Neighbours knew nothing of him till a week afterward, when Old Whateley drove his sleigh through the snow into Dunwich Village and discoursed incoherently to the group of loungers at Osborn’s general store. There seemed to be a change in the old man—an added element of furtiveness in the clouded brain which subtly transformed him from an object to a subject of fear—though he was not one to be perturbed by any common family event. Amidst it all he shewed some trace of the pride later noticed in his daughter, and what he said of the child’s paternity was remembered by many of his hearers years afterward.      “I dun’t keer what folks think—ef Lavinny’s boy looked like his pa, he wouldn’t look like nothin’ ye expeck. Ye needn’t think the only folks is the folks hereabaouts. Lavinny’s read some, an’ has seed some things the most o’ ye only tell abaout. I calc’late her man is as good a husban’ as ye kin find this side of Aylesbury; an’ ef ye knowed as much abaout the hills as I dew, ye wouldn’t ast no better church weddin’ nor her’n. Let me tell ye suthin’—some day yew folks’ll hear a child o’ Lavinny’s a-callin’ its father’s name on the top o’ Sentinel Hill!”      The only persons who saw Wilbur during the first month of his life were old Zechariah Whateley, of the undecayed Whateleys, and Earl Sawyer’s common-law wife, Mamie Bishop. Mamie’s visit was frankly one of curiosity, and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations; but Zechariah came to lead a pair of Alderney cows which Old Whateley had bought of his son Curtis. This marked the beginning of a course of cattle-buying on the part of small Wilbur’s family which ended only in 1928, when the Dunwich horror came and went; yet at no time did the ramshackle Whateley barn seem overcrowded with livestock. There came a period when people were curious enough to steal up and count the herd that grazed precariously on the steep hillside above the old farmhouse, and they could never find more than ten or twelve anaemic, bloodless-looking specimens. Evidently some blight or distemper, perhaps sprung from the unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi and timbers of the filthy barn, caused a heavy mortality amongst the Whateley animals. Odd wounds or sores, having something of the aspect of incisions, seemed to afflict the visible cattle; and once or twice during the earlier months certain callers fancied they could discern similar sores about the throats of the grey, unshaven old man and his slatternly, crinkly-haired albino daughter.      In the spring after Wilbur’s birth Lavinia resumed her customary rambles in the hills, bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy child. Public interest in the Whateleys subsided after most of the country folk had seen the baby, and no one bothered to comment on the swift development which that newcomer seemed every day to exhibit. Wilbur’s growth was indeed phenomenal, for within three months of his birth he had attained a size and muscular power not usually found in infants under a full year of age. His motions and even his vocal sounds shewed a restraint and deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant, and no one was really unprepared when, at seven months, he began to walk unassisted, with falterings which another month was sufficient to remove.      It was somewhat after this time—on Hallowe’en—that a great blaze was seen at midnight on the top of Sentinel Hill where the old table-like stone stands amidst its tumulus of ancient bones. Considerable talk was started when Silas Bishop—of the undecayed Bishops—mentioned having seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother about an hour before the blaze was remarked. Silas was rounding up a stray heifer, but he nearly forgot his mission when he fleetingly spied the two figures in the dim light of his lantern. They darted almost noiselessly through the underbrush, and the astonished watcher seemed to think they were entirely unclothed. Afterward he could not be sure about the boy, who may have had some kind of a fringed belt and a pair of dark trunks or trousers on. Wilbur was never subsequently seen alive and conscious without complete and tightly buttoned attire, the disarrangement or threatened disarrangement of which always seemed to fill him with anger and alarm. His contrast with his squalid mother and grandfather in this respect was thought very notable until the horror of 1928 suggested the most valid of reasons.      The next January gossips were mildly interested in the fact that “Lavinny’s black brat” had commenced to talk, and at the age of only eleven months. His speech was somewhat remarkable both because of its difference from the ordinary accents of the region, and because it displayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of three or four might well be proud. The boy was not talkative, yet when he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpossessed by Dunwich and its denizens. The strangeness did not reside in what he said, or even in the simple idioms he used; but seemed vaguely linked with his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the spoken sounds. His facial aspect, too, was remarkable for its maturity; for though he shared his mother’s and grandfather’s chinlessness, his firm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression of his large, dark, almost Latin eyes to give him an air of quasi-adulthood and well-nigh preternatural intelligence. He was, however, exceedingly ugly despite his appearance of brilliancy; there being something almost goatish or animalistic about his thick lips, large-pored, yellowish skin, coarse crinkly hair, and oddly elongated ears. He was soon disliked even more decidedly than his mother and grandsire, and all conjectures about him were spiced with references to the bygone magic of Old Whateley, and how the hills once shook when he shrieked the dreadful name of Yog-Sothoth in the midst of a circle of stones with a great book open in his arms before him. Dogs abhorred the boy, and he was always obliged to take various defensive measures against their barking menace."]}

A Nightmare and a Cataclysm1.And now swiftly followed that hideous experience which has left its indelible mark of fear on the soul of Marinus Bicknell Willett, and has added a decade to the visible age of one whose youth was even then far behind. Dr. Willett had conferred at length with Mr. Ward, and had come to an agreement with him on several points which both felt the alienists would ridicule. There was, they conceded, a terrible movement alive in the world, whose direct connexion with a necromancy even older than the Salem witchcraft could not be doubted. That at least two living men - and one other of whom they dared not think - were in absolute possession of minds or personalities which had functioned as early as 1690 or before was likewise almost unassailably proved even in the face of all known natural laws. What these horrible creatures - and Charles Ward as well - were doing or trying to do seemed fairly clear from their letters and from every bit of light both old and new which had filtered in upon the case. They were robbing the tombs of all the ages, including those of the worlds wisest and greatest men, in the hope of recovering from the bygone ashes some vestige of the consciousness and lore which had once animated and informed them.      A hideous traffick was going on among these nightmare ghouls, whereby illustrious bones were bartered with the calm calculativeness of schoolboys swapping books; and from what was extorted from this centuried dust there was anticipated a power and a wisdom beyond anything which the cosmos had ever seen concentrated in one man or group. They had found unholy ways to keep their brains alive, either in the same body or different bodies; and had evidently achieved a way of tapping the consciousness of the dead whom they gathered together. There had, it seems, been some truth in chimerical old Borellus when he wrote of preparing from even the most antique remains certain \"Essential Saltes\" from which the shade of a long-dead living thing might be raised up. There was a formula for evoking such a shade, and another for putting it down; and it had now been so perfected that it could be taught successfully. One must be careful about evocations, for the markers of old graves are not always accurate.      Willett and Mr. Ward shivered as they passed from conclusion to conclusion. Things - presences or voices of some sort - could be drawn down from unknown places as well as from the grave, and in this process also one must be careful. Joseph Curwen had indubitably evoked many forbidden things, and as for Charles - what might one think of him? What forces \"outside the spheres\" had reached him from Joseph Curwens day and turned his mind on forgotten things? He had been led to find certain directions, and he had used them. He had talked with the man of horror in Prague and stayed long with the creature in the mountains of Transylvania. And he must have found the grave of Joseph Curwen at last. That newspaper item and what his mother had heard in the night were too significant to overlook. Then he had summoned something, and it must have come. That mighty voice aloft on Good Friday, and those different tones in the locked attic laboratory. What were they like, with their depth and hollowness? Was there not here some awful foreshadowing of the dreaded stranger Dr. Allen with his spectral bass? Yes, that was what Mr. Ward had felt with vague horror in his single talk with the man - if man it were - over the telephone!      What hellish consciousness or voice, what morbid shade or presence, had come to answer Charles Wards secret rites behind that locked door? Those voices heard in argument - \"must have it red for three months\" - Good God! Was not that just before the vampirism broke out? The rifling of Ezra Weedens ancient grave, and the cries later at Pawtuxet - whose mind had planned the vengeance and rediscovered the shunned seat of elder blasphemies? And then the bungalow and the bearded stranger, and the gossip, and the fear. The final madness of Charles neither father nor doctor could attempt to explain, but they did feel sure that the mind of Joseph Curwen had come to earth again and was following its ancient morbidities. Was daemoniac possession in truth a possibility? Allen had something to do with it, and the detectives must find out more about one whose existence menaced the young mans life. In the meantime, since the existence of some vast crypt beneath the bungalow seemed virtually beyond dispute, some effort must be made to find it. Willett and Mr. Ward, conscious of the sceptical attitude of the alienists, resolved during their final conference to undertake a joint secret exploration of unparalleled thoroughness; and agreed to meet at the bungalow on the following morning with valises and with certain tools and accessories suited to architectural search and underground exploration.      The morning of April 6th dawned clear, and both explorers were at the bungalow by ten oclock. Mr. Ward had the key, and an entry and cursory survey were made. From the disordered condition of Dr. Allens room it was obvious that the detectives had been there before, and the later searchers hoped that they had found some clue which might prove of value. Of course the main business lay in the cellar; so thither they descended without much delay, again making the circuit which each had vainly made before in the presence of the mad young owner. For a time everything seemed baffling, each inch of the earthen floor and stone walls having so solid and innocuous an aspect that the thought of a yawning aperture was scarcely to be entertained. Willett reflected that since the original cellar was dug without knowledge of any catacombs beneath, the beginning of the passage would represent the strictly modern delving of young Ward and his associates, where they had probed for the ancient vaults whose rumour could have reached them by no wholesome means.      The doctor tried to put himself in Charless place to see how a delver would be likely to start, but could not gain much inspiration from this method. Then he decided on elimination as a policy, and went carefully over the whole subterranean surface both vertical and horizontal, trying to account for every inch separately. He was soon substantially narrowed down, and at last had nothing left but the small platform before the washtubs, which he had tried once before in vain. Now experimenting in every possible way, and exerting a double strength, he finally found that the top did indeed turn and slide horizontally on a corner pivot. Beneath it lay a trim concrete surface with an iron manhole, to which Mr. Ward at once rushed with excited zeal. The cover was not hard to lift, and the father had quite removed it when Willett noticed the queerness of his aspect. He was swaying and nodding dizzily, and in the gust of noxious air which swept up from the black pit beneath the doctor soon recognised ample cause.      In a moment Dr. Willett had his fainting companion on the floor above and was reviving him with cold water. Mr. Ward responded feebly, but it could be seen that the mephitic blast from the crypt had in some way gravely sickened him. Wishing to take no chances, Willett hastened out to Broad Street for a taxicab and had soon dispatched the sufferer home despite his weak-voiced protests; after which he produced an electric torch, covered his nostrils with a band of sterile gauze, and descended once more to peer into the new-found depths. The foul air had now slightly abated, and Willett was able to send a beam of light down the Stygian hole. For about ten feet, he saw, it was a sheer cylindrical drop with concrete walls and an iron ladder; after which the hole appeared to strike a flight of old stone steps which must originally have emerged to earth somewhat southwest of the present building.2.      Willett freely admits that for a moment the memory of the old Curwen legends kept him from climbing down alone into that malodorous gulf. He could not help thinking of what Luke Fenner had reported on that last monstrous night. Then duty asserted itself and he made the plunge, carrying a great valise for the removal of whatever papers might prove of supreme importance. Slowly, as befitted one of his years, he descended the ladder and reached the slimy steps below. This was ancient masonry, his torch told him; and upon the dripping walls he saw the unwholesome moss of centuries. Down, down, ran the steps; not spirally, but in three abrupt turns; and with such narrowness that two men could have passed only with difficulty. He had counted about thirty when a sound reached him very faintly; and after that he did not feel disposed to count any more.      It was a godless sound; one of those low-keyed, insidious outrages of Nature which are not meant to be. To call it a dull wail, a doom-dragged whine, or a hopeless howl of chorused anguish and stricken flesh without mind would be to miss its most quintessential loathsomeness and soul-sickening overtones. Was it for this that Ward had seemed to listen on that day he was removed? It was the most shocking thing that Willett had ever heard, and it continued from no determinate point as the doctor reached the bottom of the steps and cast his torchlight around on lofty corridor walls surmounted by Cyclopean vaulting and pierced by numberless black archways. The hall in which he stood was perhaps fourteen feet high to the middle of the vaulting and ten or twelve feet broad. Its pavement was of large chipped flagstones, and its walls and roof were of dressed masonry. Its length he could not imagine, for it stretched ahead indefinitely into the blackness. Of the archways, some had doors of the old six-panelled colonial type, whilst others had none.      Overcoming the dread induced by the smell and the howling, Willett began to explore these archways one by one; finding beyond them rooms with groined stone ceilings, each of medium size and apparently of bizarre uses. Most of them had fireplaces, the upper courses of whose chimneys would have formed an interesting study in engineering. Never before or since had he seen such instruments or suggestions of instruments as here loomed up on every hand through the burying dust and cobwebs of a century and a half, in many cases evidently shattered as if by the ancient raiders. For many of the chambers seemed wholly untrodden by modern feet, and must have represented the earliest and most obsolete phases of Joseph Curwens experimentation. Finally there came a room of obvious modernity, or at least of recent occupancy. There were oil heaters, bookshelves and tables, chairs and cabinets, and a desk piled high with papers of varying antiquity and contemporaneousness. Candlesticks and oil lamps stood about in several places; and finding a match-safe handy, Willett lighted such as were ready for use.      In the fuller gleam it appeared that this apartment was nothing less than the latest study or library of Charles Ward. Of the books the doctor had seen many before, and a good part of the furniture had plainly come from the Prospect Street mansion. Here and there was a piece well known to Willett, and the sense of familiarity became so great that he half forgot the noisomeness and the wailing, both of which were plainer here than they had been at the foot of the steps. His first duty, as planned long ahead, was to find and seize any papers which might seem of vital importance; especially those portentous documents found by Charles so long ago behind the picture in Olney Court. As he searched he perceived how stupendous a task the final unravelling would be; for file on file was stuffed with papers in curious hands and bearing curious designs, so that months or even years might be needed for a thorough deciphering and editing. Once he found large packets of letters with Prague and Rakus postmarks, and in writing clearly recognisable as Ornes and Hutchinsons; all of which he took with him as part of the bundle to be removed in his valise.      At last, in a locked mahogany cabinet once gracing the Ward home, Willett found the batch of old Curwen papers; recognising them from the reluctant glimpse Charles had granted him so many years ago. The youth had evidently kept them together very much as they had been when first he found them, since all the titles recalled by the workmen were present except the papers addressed to Orne and Hutchinson, and the cipher with its key. Willett placed the entire lot in his valise and continued his examination of the files. Since young Wards immediate condition was the greatest matter at stake, the closest searching was done among the most obviously recent matter; and in this abundance of contemporary manuscript one very baffling oddity was noted. The oddity was the slight amount in Charless normal writing, which indeed included nothing more recent than two months before. On the other hand, there were literally reams of symbols and formulae, historical notes and philosophical comment, in a crabbed penmanship absolutely identical with the ancient script of Joseph Curwen, though of undeniably modern dating. Plainly, a part of the latter-day programme had been a sedulous imitation of the old wizards writing, which Charles seemed to have carried to a marvellous state of perfection. Of any third hand which might have been Allens there was not a trace. If he had indeed come to be the leader, he must have forced young Ward to act as his amanuensis.      In this new material one mystic formula, or rather pair of formulae, recurred so often that Willett had it by heart before he had half finished his quest. It consisted of two parallel columns, the left-hand one surmounted by the archaic symbol called \"Dragons Head\" and used in almanacks to indicate the ascending node, and the right-hand one headed by a corresponding sign of \"Dragons Tail\" or descending node. The appearance of the whole was something like this, and almost unconsciously the doctor realised that the second half was no more than the first written syllabically backward with the exception of the final monosyllables and of the odd name Yog-Sothoth, which he had come to recognise under various spellings from other things he had seen in connexion with this horrible matter. The formulae were as follows - exactly so, as Willett is abundantly able to testify - and the first one struck an odd note of uncomfortable latent memory in his brain, which he recognised later when reviewing the events of that horrible Good Friday of the previous year.YAI NGNGAH,YOG-SOTHOTHHEE - LGEBFAI THRODOGUAAAH      \tOGTHROD AIFGEBL - EEHYOG-SOTHOTHNGAHNG AIYZHROSo haunting were these formulae, and so frequently did he come upon them, that before the doctor knew it he was repeating them under his breath. Eventually, however, he felt he had secured all the papers he could digest to advantage for the present; hence resolved to examine no more till he could bring the sceptical alienists en masse for an ampler and more systematic raid. He had still to find the hidden laboratory, so leaving his valise in the lighted room he emerged again into the black noisome corridor whose vaulting echoed ceaselessly with that dull and hideous whine.      The next few rooms he tried were all abandoned, or filled only with crumbling boxes and ominous-looking leaden coffins; but impressed him deeply with the magnitude of Joseph Curwens original operations. He thought of the slaves and seamen who had disappeared, of the graves which had been violated in every part of the world, and of what that final raiding party must have seen; and then he decided it was better not to think any more. Once a great stone staircase mounted at his right, and he deduced that this must have reached to one of the Curwen outbuildings - perhaps the famous stone edifice with the high slit-like windows - provided the steps he had descended had led from the steep-roofed farmhouse. Suddenly the walls seemed to fall away ahead, and the stench and the wailing grew stronger. Willett saw that he had come upon a vast open space, so great that his torchlight would not carry across it; and as he advanced he encountered occasional stout pillars supporting the arches of the roof.      After a time he reached a circle of pillars grouped like the monoliths of Stonehenge, with a large carved altar on a base of three steps in the centre; and so curious were the carvings on that altar that he approached to study them with his electric light. But when he saw what they were he shrank away shuddering, and did not stop to investigate the dark stains which discoloured the upper surface and had spread down the sides in occasional thin lines. Instead, he found the distant wall and traced it as it swept round in a gigantic circle perforated by occasional black doorways and indented by a myriad of shallow cells with iron gratings and wrist and ankle bonds on chains fastened to the stone of the concave rear masonry. These cells were empty, but still the horrible odour and the dismal moaning continued, more insistent now than ever, and seemingly varied at times by a sort of slippery thumping.3.      From that frightful smell and that uncanny noise Willetts attention could no longer be diverted. Both were plainer and more hideous in the great pillared hall than anywhere else, and carried a vague impression of being far below, even in this dark nether world of subterrene mystery. Before trying any of the black archways for steps leading further down, the doctor cast his beam of light about the stone-flagged floor. It was very loosely paved, and at irregular intervals there would occur a slab curiously pierced by small holes in no definite arrangement, while at one point there lay a very long ladder carelessly flung down. To this ladder, singularly enough, appeared to cling a particularly large amount of the frightful odour which encompassed everything. As he walked slowly about it suddenly occurred to Willett that both the noise and the odour seemed strongest directly above the oddly pierced slabs, as if they might be crude trap-doors leading down to some still deeper region of horror. Kneeling by one, he worked at it with his hands, and found that with extreme difficulty he could budge it. At his touch the moaning beneath ascended to a louder key, and only with vast trepidation did he persevere in the lifting of the heavy stone. A stench unnamable now rose up from below, and the doctors head reeled dizzily as he laid back the slab and turned his torch upon the exposed square yard of gaping blackness.      If he had expected a flight of steps to some wide gulf of ultimate abomination, Willett was destined to be disappointed; for amidst that foetor and cracked whining he discerned only the brick-faced top of a cylindrical well perhaps a yard and a half in diameter and devoid of any ladder or other means of descent. As the light shone down, the wailing changed suddenly to a series of horrible yelps; in conjunction with which there came again that sound of blind, futile scrambling and slippery thumping. The explorer trembled, unwilling even to imagine what noxious thing might be lurking in that abyss, but in a moment mustered up the courage to peer over the rough-hewn brink; lying at full length and holding the torch downward at arms length to see what might lie below. For a second he could distinguish nothing but the slimy, moss-grown brick walls sinking illimitably into that half-tangible miasma of murk and foulness and anguished frenzy; and then he saw that something dark was leaping clumsily and frantically up and down at the bottom of the narrow shaft, which must have been from twenty to twenty-five feet below the stone floor where he lay. The torch shook in his hand, but he looked again to see what manner of living creature might be immured there in the darkness of that unnatural well; left starving by young Ward through all the long month since the doctors had taken him away, and clearly only one of a vast number prisoned in the kindred wells whose pierced stone covers so thickly studded in the floor of the great vaulted cavern. Whatever the things were, they could not lie down in their cramped spaces; but must have crouched and whined and waited and feebly leaped all those hideous weeks since their master had abandoned them unheeded.      But Marinus Bicknell Willett was sorry that he looked again; for surgeon and veteran of the dissecting-room though he was, he has not been the same since. It is hard to explain just how a single sight of a tangible object with measureable dimensions could so shake and change a man; and we may only say that there is about certain outlines and entities a power of symbolism and suggestion which acts frightfully on a sensitive thinkers perspective and whispers terrible hints of obscure cosmic relationships and unnamable realities behind the protective illusions of common vision. In that second look Willett saw such an outline or entity, for during the next few instants he was undoubtedly as stark mad as any inmate of Dr. Waites private hospital. He dropped the electric torch from a hand drained of muscular power or nervous cordination, nor heeded the sound of crunching teeth which told of its fate at the bottom of the pit. He screamed and screamed and screamed in a voice whose falsetto panic no acquaintance of his would ever have recognised; and though he could not rise to his feet he crawled and rolled desperately away over the damp pavement where dozens of Tartarean wells poured forth their exhausted whining and yelping to answer his own insane cries. He tore his hands on the rough, loose stones, and many times bruised his head against the frequent pillars, but still he kept on. Then at last he slowly came to himself in the utter blackness and stench, and stopped his ears against the droning wail into which the burst of yelping had subsided. He was drenched with perspiration and without means of producing a light; stricken and unnerved in the abysmal blackness and horror, and crushed with a memory he never could efface. Beneath him dozens of those things still lived, and from one of the shafts the cover was removed. He knew that what he had seen could never climb up the slippery walls, yet shuddered at the thought that some obscure foot-hold might exist.      What the thing was, he would never tell. It was like some of the carvings on the hellish altar, but it was alive. Nature had never made it in this form, for it was too palpably unfinished. The deficiencies were of the most surprising sort, and the abnormalities of proportion could not be described. Willett consents only to say that this type of thing must have represented entities which Ward called up from imperfect salts, and which he kept for servile or ritualistic purposes. If it had not had a certain significance, its image would not have been carved on that damnable stone. It was not the worst thing depicted on that stone - but Willett never opened the other pits. At the time, the first connected idea in his mind was an idle paragraph from some of the old Curwen data he had digested long before; a phrase used by Simon or Jedediah Orne in that portentous confiscated letter to the bygone sorcerer: \"Certainely, there was Nothg butt ye liveliest Awfulness in that which H. raisd upp from What he coud gather onlie a part of.\"      Then, horribly supplementing rather than displacing this image, there came a recollection of those ancient lingering rumours anent the burned, twisted thing found in the fields a week after the Curwen raid. Charles Ward had once told the doctor what old Slocum said of that object; that it was neither thoroughly human, nor wholly allied to any animal which Pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about.      These words hummed in the doctors mind as he rocked to and fro, squatting on the nitrous stone floor. He tried to drive them out, and repeated the Lords Prayer to himself; eventually trailing off into a mnemonic hodge-podge like the modernistic Waste Land of Mr. T. S. Eliot and finally reverting to the oft-repeated dual formula he had lately found in Wards underground library: \"Yai ngngah, Yog-Sothoth\", and so on till the final underlined \"Zhro\". It seemed to soothe him, and he staggered to his feet after a time; lamenting bitterly his fright-lost torch and looking wildly about for any gleam of light in the clutching inkiness of the chilly air. Think he would not; but he strained his eyes in every direction for some faint glint or reflection of the bright illumination he had left in the library. After a while he thought he detected a suspicion of a glow infinitely far away, and toward this he crawled in agonised caution on hands and knees amidst the stench and howling, always feeling ahead lest he collide with the numerous great pillars or stumble into the abominable pit he had uncovered.      Once his shaking fingers touched something which he knew must be the steps leading to the hellish altar, and from this spot he recoiled in loathing. At another time he encountered the pierced slab he had removed, and here his caution became almost pitiful. But he did not come upon the dread aperture after all, nor did anything issue from that aperture to detain him. What had been down there made no sound nor stir. Evidently its crunching of the fallen electric torch had not been good for it. Each time Willetts fingers felt a perforated slab he trembled. His passage over it would sometimes increase the groaning below, but generally it would produce no effect at all, since he moved very noiselessly. Several times during his progress the glow ahead diminished perceptibly, and he realised that the various candles and lamps he had left must be expiring one by one. The thought of being lost in utter darkness without matches amidst this underground world of nightmare labyrinths impelled him to rise to his feet and run, which he could safely do now that he had passed the open pit; for he knew that once the light failed, his only hope of rescue and survival would lie in whatever relief party Mr. Ward might send after missing him for a sufficient period. Presently, however, he emerged from the open space into the narrower corridor and definitely located the glow as coming from a door on his right. In a moment he had reached it and was standing once more in young Wards secret library, trembling with relief, and watching the sputterings of that last lamp which had brought him to safety.4.      In another moment he was hastily filling the burned-out lamps from an oil supply he had previously noticed, and when the room was bright again he looked about to see if he might find a lantern for further exploration. For racked though he was with horror, his sense of grim purpose was still uppermost; and he was firmly determined to leave no stone unturned in his search for the hideous facts behind Charles Wards bizarre madness. Failing to find a lantern, he chose the smallest of the lamps to carry; also filling his pockets with candles and matches, and taking with him a gallon can of oil, which he proposed to keep for reserve use in whatever hidden laboratory he might uncover beyond the terrible open space with its unclean altar and nameless covered wells. To traverse that space again would require his utmost fortitude, but he knew it must be done. Fortunately neither the frightful altar nor the opened shaft was near the vast cell-indented wall which bounded the cavern area, and whose black mysterious archways would form the next goals of a logical search.      So Willett went back to that great pillared hall of stench and anguished howling; turning down his lamp to avoid any distant glimpse of the hellish altar, or of the uncovered pit with the pierced stone slab beside it. Most of the black doorways led merely to small chambers, some vacant and some evidently used as storerooms; and in several of the latter he saw some very curious accumulations of various objects. One was packed with rotting and dust-draped bales of spare clothing, and the explorer thrilled when he saw that it was unmistakably the clothing of a century and a half before. In another room he found numerous odds and ends of modern clothing, as if gradual provisions were being made to equip a large body of men. But what he disliked most of all were the huge copper vats which occasionally appeared; these, and the sinister incrustations upon them. He liked them even less than the weirdly figured leaden bowls whose rims retained such obnoxious deposits and around which clung repellent odours perceptible above even the general noisomeness of the crypt. When he had completed about half the entire circuit of the wall he found another corridor like that from which he had come, and out of which many doors opened. This he proceeded to investigate; and after entering three rooms of medium size and of no significant contents, he came at last to a large oblong apartment whose business-like tanks and tables, furnaces and modern instruments, occasional books and endless shelves of jars and bottles proclaimed it indeed the long-sought laboratory of Charles Ward - and no doubt of old Joseph Curwen before him.      After lighting the three lamps which he found filled and ready, Dr. Willett examined the place and all its appurtenances with the keenest interest; noting from the relative quantities of various reagents on the shelves that young Wards dominant concern must have been with some branch of organic chemistry. On the whole, little could be learned from the scientific ensemble, which included a gruesome-looking dissecting table; so that the room was really rather a disappointment. Among the books was a tattered old copy of Borellus in black-letter, and it was weirdly interesting to note that Ward had underlined the same passage whose marking had so perturbed good Mr. Merritt at Curwens farmhouse more than a century and a half before. That older copy, of course, must have perished along with the rest of Curwens occult library in the final raid. Three archways opened off the laboratory, and these the doctor proceeded to sample in turn. From his cursory survey he saw that two led merely to small storerooms; but these he canvassed with care, remarking the piles of coffins in various stages of damage and shuddering violently at two or three of the few coffin-plates he could decipher. There was much clothing also stored in these rooms, and several new and tightly nailed boxes which he did not stop to investigate. Most interesting of all, perhaps, were some odd bits which he judged to be fragments of old Joseph Curwens laboratory appliances. These had suffered damage at the hands of the raiders, but were still partly recognisable as the chemical paraphernalia of the Georgian period.      The third archway led to a very sizeable chamber entirely lined with shelves and having in the centre a table bearing two lamps. These lamps Willett lighted, and in their brilliant glow studied the endless shelving which surrounded him. Some of the upper levels were wholly vacant, but most of the space was filled with small odd-looking leaden jars of two general types; one tall and without handles like a Grecian lekythos or oil-jug, and the other with a single handle and proportioned like a Phaleron jug. All had metal stoppers, and were covered with peculiar-looking symbols moulded in low relief. In a moment the doctor noticed that these jugs were classified with great rigidity; all the lekythoi being on one side of the room with a large wooden sign reading \"Custodes\" above them, and all the Phalerons on the other, correspondingly labelled with a sign reading \"Materia\". Each of the jars or jugs, except some on the upper shelves that turned out to be vacant, bore a cardboard tag with a number apparently referring to a catalogue; and Willett resolved to look for the latter presently. For the moment, however, he was more interested in the nature of the array as a whole; and experimentally opened several of the lekythoi and Phalerons at random with a view to a rough generalisation. The result was invariable. Both types of jar contained a small quantity of a single kind of substance; a fine dusty powder of very light weight and of many shades of dull, neutral colour. To the colours which formed the only point of variation there was no apparent method of disposal; and no distinction between what occurred in the lekythoi and what occurred in the Phalerons. A bluish-grey powder might be by the side of a pinkish-white one, and any one in a Phaleron might have its exact counterpart in a lekythos. The most individual feature about the powders was their non-adhesiveness. Willett would pour one into his hand, and upon returning it to its jug would find that no residue whatever remained on its palm.      The meaning of the two signs puzzled him, and he wondered why this battery of chemicals was separated so radically from those in glass jars on the shelves of the laboratory proper. \"Custodes\", \"Materia\"; that was the Latin for \"Guards\" and \"Materials\", respectively - and then there came a flash of memory as to where he had seen that word \"Guards\" before in connexion with this dreadful mystery. It was, of course, in the recent letter to Dr. Allen purporting to be from old Edward Hutchinson; and the phrase had read: \"There was no Neede to keep the Guards in Shape and eatg off their Heads, and it made Much to be founde in Case of Trouble, as you too welle knowe.\" What did this signify? But wait - was there not still another reference to \"guards\" in this matter which he had failed wholly to recall when reading the Hutchinson letter? Back in the old non-secretive days Ward had told him of the Eleazar Smith diary recording the spying of Smith and Weeden on the Curwen farm, and in that dreadful chronicle there had been a mention of conversations overheard before the old wizard betook himself wholly beneath the earth. There had been, Smith and Weeden insisted, terrible colloquies wherein figured Curwen, certain captives of his, and the guards of those captives. Those guards, according to Hutchinson or his avatar, had eaten their heads off, so that now Dr. Allen did not keep them in shape. And if not in shape, how save as the \"salts\" to which it appears this wizard band was engaged in reducing as many human bodies or skeletons as they could?      So that was what these lekythoi contained; the monstrous fruit of unhallowed rites and deeds, presumably won or cowed to such submission as to help, when called up by some hellish incantation, in the defence of their blasphemous master or the questioning of those who were not so willing? Willett shuddered at the thought of what he had been pouring in and out of his hands, and for a moment felt an impulse to flee in panic from that cavern of hideous shelves with their silent and perhaps watching sentinels. Then he thought of the \"Materia\" - in the myriad Phaleron jugs on the other side of the room. Salts too - and if not the salts of \"guards\", then the salts of what? God! Could it be possible that here lay the mortal relics of half the titan thinkers of all the ages; snatched by supreme ghouls from crypts where the world thought them safe, and subject to the beck and call of madmen who sought to drain their knowledge for some still wilder end whose ultimate effect would concern, as poor Charles had hinted in his frantic note, all civilisation, all natural law, perhaps even the fate of the solar system and the universe? And Marinus Bicknell Willett had sifted their dust through his hands!      Then he noticed a small door at the farther end of the room, and calmed himself enough to approach it and examine the crude sign chiselled above. It was only a symbol, but it filled him with vague spiritual dread; for a morbid, dreaming friend of his had once drawn it on paper and told him a few of the things it means in the dark abyss of sleep. It was the sign of Koth, that dreamers see fixed above the archway of a certain black tower standing alone in twilight - and Willett did not like what his friend Randolph Carter had said of its powers. But a moment later he forgot the sign as he recognised a new acrid odour in the stench-filled air. This was a chemical rather than animal smell, and came clearly from the room beyond the door. And it was, unmistakably, the same odour which had saturated Charles Wards clothing on the day the doctors had taken him away. So it was here that the youth had been interrupted by the final summons? He was wiser than old Joseph Curwen, for he had not resisted. Willett, boldly determined to penetrate every wonder and nightmare this nether realm might contain, seized the small lamp and crossed the threshold. A wave of nameless fright rolled out to meet him, but he yielded to no whim and deferred to no intuition. There was nothing alive here to harm him, and he would not be stayed in his piercing of the eldritch cloud which engulfed his patient.      The room beyond the door was of medium size, and had no furniture save a table, a single chair, and two groups of curious machines with clamps and wheels, which Willett recognised after a moment as mediaeval instruments of torture. On one side of the door stood a rack of savage whips, above which were some shelves bearing empty rows of shallow pedestalled cups of lead shaped like Grecian kylikes. On the other side was the table; with a powerful Argand lamp, a pad and pencil, and two of the stoppered lekythoi from the shelves outside set down at irregular places as if temporarily or in haste. Willett lighted the lamp and looked carefully at the pad, to see what notes young Ward might have been jotting down when interrupted; but found nothing more intelligible than the following disjointed fragments in that crabbed Curwen chirography, which shed no light on the case as a whole:\"B. dyd not. Escapd into walls and founde Place below.\"Saw olde V. saye ye Sabaoth and learnt ye Way.\"Raisd Yog-Sothoth thrice and was ye nexte Day deliverd.\"F. soughte to wipe out all knowg howe to raise Those from Outside.\"      As the strong Argand blaze lit up the entire chamber the doctor saw that the wall opposite the door, between the two groups of torturing appliances in the corners, was covered with pegs from which hung a set of shapeless-looking robes of a rather dismal yellowish-white. But far more interesting were the two vacant walls, both of which were thickly covered with mystic symbols and formulae roughly chiselled in the smooth dressed stone. The damp floor also bore marks of carving; and with but little difficulty Willett deciphered a huge pentagram in the centre, with a plain circle about three feet wide half way between this and each corner. In one of these four circles, near where a yellowish robe had been flung carelessly down, there stood a shallow kylix of the sort found on the shelves above the whip-rack; and just outside the periphery was one of the Phaleron jugs from the shelves in the other room, its tag numbered 118. This was unstoppered, and proved upon inspection to be empty; but the explorer saw with a shiver that the kylix was not. Within its shallow area, and saved from scattering only by the absence of wind in this sequestered cavern, lay a small amount of a dry, dull-greenish efflorescent powder which must have belonged in the jug; and Willett almost reeled at the implications that came sweeping over him as he correlated little by little the several elements and antecedents of the scene. The whips and the instruments of torture, the dust or salts from the jug of \"Materia\", the two lekythoi from the \"Custodes\" shelf, the robes, the formulae on the walls, the notes on the pad, the hints from letters and legends, and the thousand glimpses, doubts, and suppositions which had come to torment the friends and parents of Charles Ward - all these engulfed the doctor in a tidal wave of horror as he looked at that dry greenish powder outspread in the pedestalled leaden kylix on the floor.      With an effort, however, Willett pulled himself together and began studying the formulae chiselled on the walls. From the stained and incrusted letters it was obvious that they were carved in Joseph Curwens time, and their text was such as to be vaguely familiar to one who had read much Curwen material or delved extensively into the history of magic. One the doctor clearly recognised as what Mrs. Ward heard her son chanting on that ominous Good Friday a year before, and what an authority had told him was a very terrible invocation addressed to secret gods outside the normal spheres. It was not spelled here exactly as Mrs. Ward had set it down from memory, nor yet as the authority had shewn it to him in the forbidden pages of \"Eliphas Levi\"; but its identity was unmistakable, and such words as Sabaoth, Metraton, Almousin, and Zariatnatmik sent a shudder of fright through the searcher who had seen and felt so much of cosmic abomination just around the corner.      This was on the left-hand wall as one entered the room. The right-hand wall was no less thickly inscribed, and Willett felt a start of recognition as he came upon the pair of formulae so frequently occurring in the recent notes in the library. They were, roughly speaking, the same; with the ancient symbols of \"Dragons Head\" and \"Dragons Tail\" heading them as in Wards scribblings. But the spelling differed quite widely from that of the modern versions, as if old Curwen had had a different way of recording sound, or as if later study had evolved more powerful and perfected variants of the invocations in question. The doctor tried to reconcile the chiselled version with the one which still ran persistently in his head, and found it hard to do. Where the script he had memorised began \"Yai ngngah, Yog-Sothoth\", this epigraph started out as \"Aye, engengah, Yogge-Sothotha\"; which to his mind would seriously interfere with the syllabification of the second word.      Ground as the later text was into his consciousness, the discrepancy disturbed him; and he found himself chanting the first of the formulae aloud in an effort to square the sound he conceived with the letters he found carved. Weird and menacing in that abyss of antique blasphemy rang his voice; its accents keyed to a droning sing-song either through the spell of the past and the unknown, or through the hellish example of that dull, godless wail from the pits whose inhuman cadences rose and fell rhythmically in the distance through the stench and the darkness.\"YAI NGNGAH,YOG-SOTHOTHHEE - LGEBFAI THRODOGUAAAH!\"      But what was this cold wind which had sprung into life at the very outset of the chant? The lamps were sputtering woefully, and the gloom grew so dense that the letters on the wall nearly faded from sight. There was smoke, too, and an acrid odour which quite drowned out the stench from the far-away wells; an odour like that he had smelt before, yet infinitely stronger and more pungent. He turned from the inscriptions to face the room with its bizarre contents, and saw that the kylix on the floor, in which the ominous efflorescent powder had lain, was giving forth a cloud of thick, greenish-black vapour of surprising volume and opacity. That powder - Great God! it had come from the shelf of \"Materia\" - what was it doing now, and what had started it? The formula he had been chanting - the first of the pair - Dragons Head, ascending node - Blessed Saviour, could it be. . . .      The doctor reeled, and through his head raced wildly disjointed scraps from all he had seen, heard, and read of the frightful case of Joseph Curwen and Charles Dexter Ward. \"I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe. . . . Have ye Wordes for laying at all times readie, and stopp not to be sure when there is any Doubte of Whom you have. . . . Three Talkes with What was therein inhumd. . . .\" Mercy of Heaven, what is that shape behind the parting smoke?5.      Marinus Bicknell Willett has no hope that any part of his tale will be believed except by certain sympathetic friends, hence he has made no attempt to tell it beyond his most intimate circle. Only a few outsiders have ever heard it repeated, and of these the majority laugh and remark that the doctor surely is getting old. He has been advised to take a long vacation and to shun future cases dealing with mental disturbance. But Mr. Ward knows that the veteran physician speaks only a horrible truth. Did not he himself see the noisome aperture in the bungalow cellar? Did not Willett send him home overcome and ill at eleven oclock that portentous morning? Did he not telephone the doctor in vain that evening, and again the next day, and had he not driven to the bungalow itself on that following noon, finding his friend unconscious but unharmed on one of the beds upstairs? Willett had been breathing stertorously, and opened his eyes slowly when Mr. Ward gave him some brandy fetched from the car. Then he shuddered and screamed, crying out, \"That beard . . . those eyes. . . . God, who are you?\" A very strange thing to say to a trim, blue-eyed, clean-shaven gentleman whom he had known from the latters boyhood.      In the bright noon sunlight the bungalow was unchanged since the previous morning. Willetts clothing bore no disarrangement beyond certain smudges and worn places at the knees, and only a faint acrid odour reminded Mr. Ward of what he had smelt on his son that day he was taken to the hospital. The doctors flashlight was missing, but his valise was safely there, as empty as when he had brought it. Before indulging in any explanations, and obviously with great moral effort, Willett staggered dizzily down to the cellar and tried the fateful platform before the tubs. It was unyielding. Crossing to where he had left his yet unused tool satchel the day before, he obtained a chisel and began to pry up the stubborn planks one by one. Underneath the smooth concrete was still visible, but of any opening or perforation there was no longer a trace. Nothing yawned this time to sicken the mystified father who had followed the doctor downstairs; only the smooth concrete underneath the planks - no noisome well, no world of subterrene horrors, no secret library, no Curwen papers, no nightmare pits of stench and howling, no laboratory or shelves or chiselled formulae, no. . . . Dr. Willett turned pale, and clutched at the younger man. \"Yesterday,\" he asked softly, \"did you see it here . . . and smell it?\" And when Mr. Ward, himself transfixed with dread and wonder, found strength to nod an affirmative, the physician gave a sound half a sigh and half a gasp, and nodded in turn. \"Then I will tell you,\" he said.      So for an hour, in the sunniest room they could find upstairs, the physician whispered his frightful tale to the wondering father. There was nothing to relate beyond the looming up of that form when the greenish-black vapour from the kylix parted, and Willett was too tired to ask himself what had really occurred. There were futile, bewildered head-shakings from both men, and once Mr. Ward ventured a hushed suggestion, \"Do you suppose it would be of any use to dig?\" The doctor was silent, for it seemed hardly fitting for any human brain to answer when powers of unknown spheres had so vitally encroached on this side of the Great Abyss. Again Mr. Ward asked, \"But where did it go? It brought you here, you know, and it sealed up the hole somehow.\" And Willett again let silence answer for him.      But after all, this was not the final phase of the matter. Reaching for his handkerchief before rising to leave, Dr. Willetts fingers closed upon a piece of paper in his pocket which had not been there before, and which was companioned by the candles and matches he had seized in the vanished vault. It was a common sheet, torn obviously from the cheap pad in that fabulous room of horror somewhere underground, and the writing upon it was that of an ordinary lead pencil - doubtless the one which had lain beside the pad. It was folded very carelessly, and beyond the faint acrid scent of the cryptic chamber bore no print or mark of any world but this. But in the text itself it did indeed reek with wonder; for here was no script of any wholesome age, but the laboured strokes of mediaeval darkness, scarcely legible to the laymen who now strained over it, yet having combinations of symbols which seemed vaguely familiar. The briefly scrawled message was this, and its mystery lent purpose to the shaken pair, who forthwith walked steadily out to the Ward car and gave orders to be driven first to a quiet dining place and then to the John Hay Library on the hill.      At the library it was easy to find good manuals of palaeography, and over these the two men puzzled till the lights of evening shone out from the great chandelier. In the end they found what was needed. The letters were indeed no fantastic invention, but the normal script of a very dark period. They were the pointed Saxon minuscules of the eighth or ninth century A.D., and brought with them memories of an uncouth time when under a fresh Christian veneer ancient faiths and ancient rites stirred stealthily, and the pale moon of Britain looked sometimes on strange deeds in the Roman ruins of Caerleon and Hexham, and by the towers along Hadrians crumbling wall. The words were in such Latin as a barbarous age might remember - \"Corvinus necandus est. Cadaver aq(ua) forti dissolvendum, nec aliq(ui)d retinendum. Tace ut potes.\" - which may roughly be translated, \"Curwen must be killed. The body must be dissolved in aqua fortis, nor must anything be retained. Keep silence as best you are able.\"      Willett and Mr. Ward were mute and baffled. They had met the unknown, and found that they lacked emotions to respond to it as they vaguely believed they ought. With Willett, especially, the capacity for receiving fresh impressions of awe was well-nigh exhausted; and both men sat still and helpless till the closing of the library forced them to leave. Then they drove listlessly to the Ward mansion in Prospect Street, and talked to no purpose into the night. The doctor rested toward morning, but did not go home. And he was still there Sunday noon when a telephone message came from the detectives who had been assigned to look up Dr. Allen.      Mr. Ward, who was pacing nervously about in a dressing-gown, answered the call in person; and told the men to come up early the next day when he heard their report was almost ready. Both Willett and he were glad that this phase of the matter was taking form, for whatever the origin of the strange minuscule message, it seemed certain that the \"Curwen\" who must be destroyed could be no other than the bearded and spectacled stranger. Charles had feared this man, and had said in the frantic note that he must be killed and dissolved in acid. Allen, moreover, had been receiving letters from the strange wizards in Europe under the name of Curwen, and palpably regarded himself as an avatar of the bygone necromancer. And now from a fresh and unknown source had come a message saying that \"Curwen\" must be killed and dissolved in acid. The linkage was too unmistakable to be factitious; and besides, was not Allen planning to murder young Ward upon the advice of the creature called Hutchinson? Of course, the letter they had seen had never reached the bearded stranger; but from its text they could see that Allen had already formed plans for dealing with the youth if he grew too squeamish. Without doubt, Allen must be apprehended; and even if the most drastic directions were not carried out, he must be placed where he could inflict no harm upon Charles Ward.      That afternoon, hoping against hope to extract some gleam of information anent the inmost mysteries from the only available one capable of giving it, the father and the doctor went down the bay and called on young Charles at the hospital. Simply and gravely Willett told him all he had found, and noticed how pale he turned as each description made certain the truth of the discovery. The physician employed as much dramatic effect as he could, and watched for a wincing on Charless part when he approached the matter of the covered pits and the nameless hybrids within. But Ward did not wince. Willett paused, and his voice grew indignant as he spoke of how the things were starving. He taxed the youth with shocking inhumanity, and shivered when only a sardonic laugh came in reply. For Charles, having dropped as useless his pretence that the crypt did not exist, seemed to see some ghastly jest in this affair; and chuckled hoarsely at something which amused him. Then he whispered, in accents doubly terrible because of the cracked voice he used, \"Damn em, they do eat, but they dont need to! Thats the rare part! A month, you say, without food? Lud, Sir, you be modest! Dye know, that was the joke on poor old Whipple with his virtuous bluster! Kill everything off, would he? Why, damme, he was half-deaf with the noise from Outside and never saw or heard aught from the wells! He never dreamed they were there at all! Devil take ye, those cursed things have been howling down there ever since Curwen was done for a hundred and fifty-seven years gone!\"      But no more than this could Willett get from the youth. Horrified, yet almost convinced against his will, he went on with his tale in the hope that some incident might startle his auditor out of the mad composure he maintained. Looking at the youths face, the doctor could not but feel a kind of terror at the changes which recent months had wrought. Truly, the boy had drawn down nameless horrors from the skies. When the room with the formulae and the greenish dust was mentioned, Charles shewed his first sign of animation. A quizzical look overspread his face as he heard what Willett had read on the pad, and he ventured the mild statement that those notes were old ones, of no possible significance to anyone not deeply initiated in the history of magic. \"But,\" he added, \"had you but known the words to bring up that which I had out in the cup, you had not been here to tell me this. Twas Number 118, and I conceive you would have shook had you looked it up in my list in tother room. Twas never raised by me, but I meant to have it up that day you came to invite me hither.\"      Then Willett told of the formula he had spoken and of the greenish-black smoke which had arisen; and as he did so he saw true fear dawn for the first time on Charles Wards face. \"It came, and you be here alive?\" As Ward croaked the words his voice seemed almost to burst free of its trammels and sink to cavernous abysses of uncanny resonance. Willett, gifted with a flash of inspiration, believed he saw the situation, and wove into his reply a caution from a letter he remembered. \"No. 118, you say? But dont forget that stones are all changed now in nine grounds out of ten. You are never sure till you question!\" And then, without warning, he drew forth the minuscule message and flashed it before the patients eyes. He could have wished no stronger result, for Charles Ward fainted forthwith.      All this conversation, of course, had been conducted with the greatest secrecy lest the resident alienists accuse the father and the physician of encouraging a madman in his delusions. Unaided, too, Dr. Willett and Mr. Ward picked up the stricken youth and placed him on the couch. In reviving, the patient mumbled many times of some word which he must get to Orne and Hutchinson at once; so when his consciousness seemed fully back the doctor told him that of those strange creatures at least one was his bitter enemy, and had given Dr. Allen advice for his assassination. This revelation produced no visible effect, and before it was made the visitors could see that their host had already the look of a hunted man. After that he would converse no more, so Willett and the father departed presently; leaving behind a caution against the bearded Allen, to which the youth only replied that this individual was very safely taken care of, and could do no one any harm even if he wished. This was said with an almost evil chuckle very painful to hear. They did not worry about any communications Charles might indite to that monstrous pair in Europe, since they knew that the hospital authorities seized all outgoing mail for censorship and would pass no wild or outr-looking missive.      There is, however, a curious sequel to the matter of Orne and Hutchinson, if such indeed the exiled wizards were. Moved by some vague presentiment amidst the horrors of that period, Willett arranged with an international press-cutting bureau for accounts of notable current crimes and accidents in Prague and in eastern Transylvania; and after six months believed that he had found two very significant things amongst the multifarious items he received and had translated. One was the total wrecking of a house by night in the oldest quarter of Prague, and the disappearance of the evil old man called Josef Nadek, who had dwelt in it alone ever since anyone could remember. The other was a titan explosion in the Transylvanian mountains east of Rakus, and the utter extirpation with all its inmates of the ill-regarded Castle Ferenczy, whose master was so badly spoken of by peasants and soldiery alike that he would shortly have been summoned to Bucharest for serious questioning had not this incident cut off a career already so long as to antedate all common memory. Willett maintains that the hand which wrote those minuscules was able to wield stronger weapons as well; and that while Curwen was left to him to dispose of, the writer felt able to find and deal with Orne and Hutchinson itself. Of what their fate may have been the doctor strives sedulously not to think.6.      The following morning Dr. Willett hastened to the Ward home to be present when the detectives arrived. Allens destruction or imprisonment - or Curwens, if one might regard the tacit claim to reincarnation as valid - he felt must be accomplished at any cost, and he communicated this conviction to Mr. Ward as they sat waiting for the men to come. They were downstairs this time, for the upper parts of the house were beginning to be shunned because of a peculiar nauseousness which hung indefinitely about; a nauseousness which the older servants connected with some curse left by the vanished Curwen portrait.      At nine oclock the three detectives presented themselves and immediately delivered all that they had to say. They had not, regrettably enough, located the Brava Tony Gomes as they had wished, nor had they found the least trace of Dr. Allens source or present whereabouts; but they had managed to unearth a considerable number of local impressions and facts concerning the reticent stranger. Allen had struck Pawtuxet people as a vaguely unnatural being, and there was an universal belief that his thick sandy beard was either dyed or false - a belief conclusively upheld by the finding of such a false beard, together with a pair of dark glasses, in his room at the fateful bungalow. His voice, Mr. Ward could well testify from his one telephone conversation, had a depth and hollowness that could not be forgotten; and his glance seemed malign even through his smoked and horn-rimmed glasses. One shopkeeper, in the course of negotiations, had seen a specimen of his handwriting and declared it was very queer and crabbed; this being confirmed by pencilled notes of no clear meaning found in his room and identified by the merchant. In connexion with the vampirism rumours of the preceding summer, a majority of the gossips believed that Allen rather than Ward was the actual vampire. Statements were also obtained from the officials who had visited the bungalow after the unpleasant incident of the motor truck robbery. They had felt less of the sinister in Dr. Allen, but had recognised him as the dominant figure in the queer shadowy cottage. The place had been too dark for them to observe him clearly, but they would know him again if they saw him. His beard had looked odd, and they thought he had some slight scar above his dark spectacled right eye. As for the detectives search of Allens room, it yielded nothing definite save the beard and glasses, and several pencilled notes in a crabbed writing which Willett at once saw was identical with that shared by the old Curwen manuscripts and by the voluminous recent notes of young Ward found in the vanished catacombs of horror.      Dr. Willett and Mr. Ward caught something of a profound, subtle, and insidious cosmic fear from this data as it was gradually unfolded, and almost trembled in following up the vague, mad thought which had simultaneously reached their minds. The false beard and glasses - the crabbed Curwen penmanship - the old portrait and its tiny scar - and the altered youth in the hospital with such a scar - that deep, hollow voice on the telephone - was it not of this that Mr. Ward was reminded when his son barked forth those pitiable tones to which he now claimed to be reduced? Who had ever seen Charles and Allen together? Yes, the officials had once, but who later on? Was it not when Allen left that Charles suddenly lost his growing fright and began to live wholly at the bungalow? Curwen - Allen - Ward - in what blasphemous and abominable fusion had two ages and two persons become involved? That damnable resemblance of the picture to Charles - had it not used to stare and stare, and follow the boy around the room with its eyes? Why, too, did both Allen and Charles copy Joseph Curwens handwriting, even when alone and off guard? And then the frightful work of those people - the lost crypt of horrors that had aged the doctor overnight; the starved monsters in the noisome pits; the awful formula which had yielded such nameless results; the message in minuscules found in Willetts pocket; the papers and the letters and all the talk of graves and \"salts\" and discoveries - whither did everything lead? In the end Mr. Ward did the most sensible thing. Steeling himself against any realisation of why he did it, he gave the detectives an article to be shewn to such Pawtuxet shopkeepers as had seen the portentous Dr. Allen. That article was a photograph of his luckless son, on which he now carefully drew in ink the pair of heavy glasses and the black pointed beard which the men had brought from Allens room.      For two hours he waited with the doctor in the oppressive house where fear and miasma were slowly gathering as the empty panel in the upstairs library leered and leered and leered. Then the men returned. Yes. The altered photograph was a very passable likeness of Dr. Allen. Mr. Ward turned pale, and Willett wiped a suddenly dampened brow with his handkerchief. Allen - Ward - Curwen - it was becoming too hideous for coherent thought. What had the boy called out of the void, and what had it done to him? What, really, had happened from first to last? Who was this Allen who sought to kill Charles as too squeamish, and why had his destined victim said in the postscript to that frantic letter that he must be so completely obliterated in acid? Why, too, had the minuscule message, of whose origin no one dared think, said that \"Curwen\" must be likewise obliterated? What was the change, and when had the final stage occurred? That day when his frantic note was received - he had been nervous all the morning, then there was an alteration. He had slipped out unseen and swaggered boldly in past the men hired to guard him. That was the time, when he was out. But no - had he not cried out in terror as he entered his study - this very room? What had he found there? Or wait - what had found him? That simulacrum which brushed boldly in without having been seen to go - was that an alien shadow and a horror forcing itself upon a trembling figure which had never gone out at all? Had not the butler spoken of queer noises?      Willett rang for the man and asked him some low-toned questions. It had, surely enough, been a bad business. There had been noises - a cry, a gasp, a choking, and a sort of clattering or creaking or thumping, or all of these. And Mr. Charles was not the same when he stalked out without a word. The butler shivered as he spoke, and sniffed at the heavy air that blew down from some open window upstairs. Terror had settled definitely upon the house, and only the business-like detectives failed to imbibe a full measure of it. Even they were restless, for this case had held vague elements in the background which pleased them not at all. Dr. Willett was thinking deeply and rapidly, and his thoughts were terrible ones. Now and then he would almost break into muttering as he ran over in his head a new, appalling, and increasingly conclusive chain of nightmare happenings.      Then Mr. Ward made a sign that the conference was over, and everyone save him and the doctor left the room. It was noon now, but shadows as of coming night seemed to engulf the phantom-haunted mansion. Willett began talking very seriously to his host, and urged that he leave a great deal of the future investigation to him. There would be, he predicted, certain obnoxious elements which a friend could bear better than a relative. As family physician he must have a free hand, and the first thing he required was a period alone and undisturbed in the abandoned library upstairs, where the ancient overmantel had gathered about itself an aura of noisome horror more intense than when Joseph Curwens features themselves glanced slyly down from the painted panel.      Mr. Ward, dazed by the flood of grotesque morbidities and unthinkably maddening suggestions that poured in upon him from every side, could only acquiesce; and half an hour later the doctor was locked in the shunned room with the panelling from Olney Court. The father, listening outside, heard fumbling sounds of moving and rummaging as the moments passed; and finally a wrench and a creak, as if a tight cupboard door were being opened. Then there was a muffled cry, a kind of snorting choke, and a hasty slamming of whatever had been opened. Almost at once the key rattled and Willett appeared in the hall, haggard and ghastly, and demanding wood for the real fireplace on the south wall of the room. The furnace was not enough, he said; and the electric log had little practical use. Longing yet not daring to ask questions, Mr. Ward gave the requisite orders and a man brought some stout pine logs, shuddering as he entered the tainted air of the library to place them in the grate. Willett meanwhile had gone up to the dismantled laboratory and brought down a few odds and ends not included in the moving of the July before. They were in a covered basket, and Mr. Ward never saw what they were.      Then the doctor locked himself in the library once more, and by the clouds of smoke which rolled down past the windows from the chimney it was known that he had lighted the fire. Later, after a great rustling of newspapers, that odd wrench and creaking were heard again; followed by a thumping which none of the eavesdroppers liked. Thereafter two suppressed cries of Willetts were heard, and hard upon these came a swishing rustle of indefinable hatefulness. Finally the smoke that the wind beat down from the chimney grew very dark and acrid, and everyone wished that the weather had spared them this choking and venomous inundation of peculiar fumes. Mr. Wards head reeled, and the servants all clustered together in a knot to watch the horrible black smoke swoop down. After an age of waiting the vapours seemed to lighten, and half-formless sounds of scraping, sweeping, and other minor operations were heard behind the bolted door. And at last, after the slamming of some cupboard within, Willett made his appearance - sad, pale, and haggard, and bearing the cloth-draped basket he had taken from the upstairs laboratory. He had left the window open, and into that once accursed room was pouring a wealth of pure, wholesome air to mix with a queer new smell of disinfectants. The ancient overmantel still lingered; but it seemed robbed of malignity now, and rose as calm and stately in its white panelling as if it had never borne the picture of Joseph Curwen. Night was coming on, yet this time its shadows held no latent fright, but only a gentle melancholy. Of what he had done the doctor would never speak. To Mr. Ward he said, \"I can answer no questions, but I will say that there are different kinds of magic. I have made a great purgation, and those in this house will sleep the better for it.\"7.      That Dr. Willetts \"purgation\" had been an ordeal almost as nerve-racking in its way as his hideous wandering in the vanished crypt is shewn by the fact that the elderly physician gave out completely as soon as he reached home that evening. For three days he rested constantly in his room, though servants later muttered something about having heard him after midnight on Wednesday, when the outer door softly opened and closed with phenomenal softness. Servants imaginations, fortunately, are limited, else comment might have been excited by an item in Thursdays Evening Bulletin which ran as follows:North End GhoulsActive AgainAfter a lull of ten months since the dastardly vandalism in the Weeden lot at the North Burial Ground, a nocturnal prowler was glimpsed early this morning in the same cemetery by Robert Hart, the night watchman. Happening to glance for a moment from his shelter at about 2 a.m., Hart observed the glow of a lantern or pocket torch not far to the northwest, and upon opening the door detected the figure of a man with a trowel very plainly silhouetted against a nearby electric light. At once starting in pursuit, he saw the figure dart hurriedly toward the main entrance, gaining the street and losing himself among the shadows before approach or capture was possible.      Like the first of the ghouls active during the past year, this intruder had done no real damage before detection. A vacant part of the Ward lot shewed signs of a little superficial digging, but nothing even nearly the size of a grave had been attempted, and no previous grave had been disturbed.      Hart, who cannot describe the prowler except as a small man probably having a full beard, inclines to the view that all three of the digging incidents have a common source; but police from the Second Station think otherwise on account of the savage nature of the second incident, where an ancient coffin was removed and its headstone violently shattered.      The first of the incidents, in which it is thought an attempt to bury something was frustrated, occurred a year ago last March, and has been attributed to bootleggers seeking a cache. It is possible, says Sergt. Riley, that this third affair is of similar nature. Officers at the Second Station are taking especial pains to capture the gang of miscreants responsible for these repeated outrages.      All day Thursday Dr. Willett rested as if recuperating from something past or nerving himself for something to come. In the evening he wrote a note to Mr. Ward, which was delivered the next morning and which caused the half-dazed parent to ponder long and deeply. Mr. Ward had not been able to go down to business since the shock of Monday with its baffling reports and its sinister \"purgation\", but he found something calming about the doctors letter in spite of the despair it seemed to promise and the fresh mysteries it seemed to evoke.\"10 Barnes St.,            Providence, R.I.,      April 12, 1928.\"Dear Theodore: - I feel that I must say a word to you before doing what I am going to do tomorrow. It will conclude the terrible business we have been going through (for I feel that no spade is ever likely to reach that monstrous place we know of), but Im afraid it wont set your mind at rest unless I expressly assure you how very conclusive it is.      \"You have known me ever since you were a small boy, so I think you will not distrust me when I hint that some matters are best left undecided and unexplored. It is better that you attempt no further speculation as to Charless case, and almost imperative that you tell his mother nothing more than she already suspects. When I call on you tomorrow Charles will have escaped. That is all which need remain in anyones mind. He was mad, and he escaped. You can tell his mother gently and gradually about the mad part when you stop sending the typed notes in his name. Id advise you to join her in Atlantic City and take a rest yourself. God knows you need one after this shock, as I do myself. I am going South for a while to calm down and brace up.      \"So dont ask me any questions when I call. It may be that something will go wrong, but Ill tell you if it does. I dont think it will. There will be nothing more to worry about, for Charles will be very, very safe. He is now - safer than you dream. You need hold no fears about Allen, and who or what he is. He forms as much a part of the past as Joseph Curwens picture, and when I ring your doorbell you may feel certain that there is no such person. And what wrote that minuscule message will never trouble you or yours.      \"But you must steel yourself to melancholy, and prepare your wife to do the same. I must tell you frankly that Charless escape will not mean his restoration to you. He has been afflicted with a peculiar disease, as you must realise from the subtle physical as well as mental changes in him, and you must not hope to see him again. Have only this consolation - that he was never a fiend or even truly a madman, but only an eager, studious, and curious boy whose love of mystery and of the past was his undoing. He stumbled on things no mortal ought ever to know, and reached back through the years as no one ever should reach; and something came out of those years to engulf him.      \"And now comes the matter in which I must ask you to trust me most of all. For there will be, indeed, no uncertainty about Charless fate. In about a year, say, you can if you wish devise a suitable account of the end; for the boy will be no more. You can put up a stone in your lot at the North Burial Ground exactly ten feet west of your fathers and facing the same way, and that will mark the true resting-place of your son. Nor need you fear that it will mark any abnormality or changeling. The ashes in that grave will be those of your own unaltered bone and sinew - of the real Charles Dexter Ward whose mind you watched from infancy - the real Charles with the olive-mark on his hip and without the black witch-mark on his chest or the pit on his forehead. The Charles who never did actual evil, and who will have paid with his life for his squeamishness.      \"That is all. Charles will have escaped, and a year from now you can put up his stone. Do not question me tomorrow. And believe that the honour of your ancient family remains untainted now, as it has been at all times in the past.      \"With profoundest sympathy, and exhortations to fortitude, calmness, and resignation, I am everSincerely your friend,      Marinus B. Willett\"      So on the morning of Friday, April 13, 1928, Marinus Bicknell Willett visited the room of Charles Dexter Ward at Dr. Waites private hospital on Conanicut Island. The youth, though making no attempt to evade his caller, was in a sullen mood; and seemed disinclined to open the conversation which Willett obviously desired. The doctors discovery of the crypt and his monstrous experience therein had of course created a new source of embarrassment, so that both hesitated perceptibly after the interchange of a few strained formalities. Then a new element of constraint crept in, as Ward seemed to read behind the doctors mask-like face a terrible purpose which had never been there before. The patient quailed, conscious that since the last visit there had been a change whereby the solicitous family physician had given place to the ruthless and implacable avenger.      Ward actually turned pale, and the doctor was the first to speak. \"More,\" he said, \"has been found out, and I must warn you fairly that a reckoning is due.\"      \"Digging again, and coming upon more poor starving pets?\" was the ironic reply. It was evident that the youth meant to shew bravado to the last.      \"No,\" Willett slowly rejoined, \"this time I did not have to dig. We have had men looking up Dr. Allen, and they found the false beard and spectacles in the bungalow.\"      \"Excellent,\" commented the disquieted host in an effort to be wittily insulting, \"and I trust they proved more becoming than the beard and glasses you now have on!\"      \"They would become you very well,\" came the even and studied response, \"as indeed they seem to have done.\"      As Willett said this, it almost seemed as though a cloud passed over the sun; though there was no change in the shadows on the floor. Then Ward ventured:      \"And is this what asks so hotly for a reckoning? Suppose a man does find it now and then useful to be twofold?\"      \"No,\" said Willett gravely, \"again you are wrong. It is no business of mine if any man seeks duality; provided he has any right to exist at all, and provided he does not destroy what called him out of space.\"      Ward now started violently. \"Well, Sir, what have ye found, and what dye want with me?\"      The doctor let a little time elapse before replying, as if choosing his words for an effective answer.      \"I have found,\" he finally intoned, \"something in a cupboard behind an ancient overmantel where a picture once was, and I have burned it and buried the ashes where the grave of Charles Dexter Ward ought to be.\"      The madman choked and sprang from the chair in which he had been sitting:      \"Damn ye, who did ye tell - and wholl believe it was he after these full two months, with me alive? What dye mean to do?\"      Willett, though a small man, actually took on a kind of judicial majesty as he calmed the patient with a gesture.      \"I have told no one. This is no common case - it is a madness out of time and a horror from beyond the spheres which no police or lawyers or courts or alienists could ever fathom or grapple with. Thank God some chance has left inside me the spark of imagination, that I might not go astray in thinking out this thing. You cannot deceive me, Joseph Curwen, for I know that your accursed magic is true!      \"I know how you wove the spell that brooded outside the years and fastened on your double and descendant; I know how you drew him into the past and got him to raise you up from your detestable grave; I know how he kept you hidden in his laboratory while you studied modern things and roved abroad as a vampire by night, and how you later shewed yourself in beard and glasses that no one might wonder at your godless likeness to him; I know what you resolved to do when he balked at your monstrous rifling of the worlds tombs, and at what you planned afterward, and I know how you did it.      \"You left off your beard and glasses and fooled the guards around the house. They thought it was he who went in, and they thought it was he who came out when you had strangled and hidden him. But you hadnt reckoned on the different contents of two minds. You were a fool, Curwen, to fancy that a mere visual identity would be enough. Why didnt you think of the speech and the voice and the handwriting? It hasnt worked, you see, after all. You know better than I who or what wrote that message in minuscules, but I will warn you it was not written in vain. There are abominations and blasphemies which must be stamped out, and I believe that the writer of those words will attend to Orne and Hutchinson. One of those creatures wrote you once, do not call up any that you can not put down. You were undone once before, perhaps in that very way, and it may be that your own evil magic will undo you all again. Curwen, a man cant tamper with Nature beyond certain limits, and every horror you have woven will rise up to wipe you out.\"      But here the doctor was cut short by a convulsive cry from the creature before him. Hopelessly at bay, weaponless, and knowing that any show of physical violence would bring a score of attendants to the doctors rescue, Joseph Curwen had recourse to his one ancient ally, and began a series of cabbalistic motions with his forefingers as his deep, hollow voice, now unconcealed by feigned hoarseness, bellowed out the opening words of a terrible formula.      \"PER ADONAI ELOIM, ADONAI JEHOVA, ADONAI SABAOTH, METRATON. . . .\"      But Willett was too quick for him. Even as the dogs in the yard outside began to howl, and even as a chill wind sprang suddenly up from the bay, the doctor commenced the solemn and measured intonation of that which he had meant all along to recite. An eye for an eye - magic for magic - let the outcome shew how well the lesson of the abyss had been learned! So in a clear voice Marinus Bicknell Willett began the second of that pair of formulae whose first had raised the writer of those minuscules - the cryptic invocation whose heading was the Dragons Tail, sign of the descending node - \"OGTHROD AIFGEBL - EEHYOG-SOTHOTHNGAHNG AIYZHRO!\"      At the very first word from Willetts mouth the previously commenced formula of the patient stopped short. Unable to speak, the monster made wild motions with his arms until they too were arrested. When the awful name of Yog-Sothoth was uttered, the hideous change began. It was not merely a dissolution, but rather a transformation or recapitulation; and Willett shut his eyes lest he faint before the rest of the incantation could be pronounced.      But he did not faint, and that man of unholy centuries and forbidden secrets never troubled the world again. The madness out of time had subsided, and the case of Charles Dexter Ward was closed. Opening his eyes before staggering out of that room of horror, Dr. Willett saw that what he had kept in memory had not been kept amiss. There had, as he had predicted, been no need for acids. For like his accursed picture a year before, Joseph Curwen now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust.", "“Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimaeras—dire stories of Celaeno and the Harpies—may reproduce themselves in the brain of superstition—but they were there before. They are transcripts, types—the archetypes are in us, and eternal. How else should the recital of that which we know in a waking sense to be false come to affect us at all? Is it that we naturally conceive terror from such objects, considered in their capacity of being able to inflict upon us bodily injury? O, least of all! These terrors are of older standing. They date beyond body—or without the body, they would have been the same. . . . That the kind of fear here treated is purely spiritual—that it is strong in proportion as it is objectless on earth, that it predominates in the period of our sinless infancy—are difficulties the solution of which might afford some probable insight into our ante-mundane condition, and a peep at least into the shadowland of pre-existence.”—Charles Lamb: “Witches and Other Night-Fears”I.When a traveller in north central Massachusetts takes the wrong fork at the junction of the Aylesbury pike just beyond Dean’s Corners he comes upon a lonely and curious country. The ground gets higher, and the brier-bordered stone walls press closer and closer against the ruts of the dusty, curving road. The trees of the frequent forest belts seem too large, and the wild weeds, brambles, and grasses attain a luxuriance not often found in settled regions. At the same time the planted fields appear singularly few and barren; while the sparsely scattered houses wear a surprisingly uniform aspect of age, squalor, and dilapidation. Without knowing why, one hesitates to ask directions from the gnarled, solitary figures spied now and then on crumbling doorsteps or on the sloping, rock-strown meadows. Those figures are so silent and furtive that one feels somehow confronted by forbidden things, with which it would be better to have nothing to do. When a rise in the road brings the mountains in view above the deep woods, the feeling of strange uneasiness is increased. The summits are too rounded and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness, and sometimes the sky silhouettes with especial clearness the queer circles of tall stone pillars with which most of them are crowned.      Gorges and ravines of problematical depth intersect the way, and the crude wooden bridges always seem of dubious safety. When the road dips again there are stretches of marshland that one instinctively dislikes, and indeed almost fears at evening when unseen whippoorwills chatter and the fireflies come out in abnormal profusion to dance to the raucous, creepily insistent rhythms of stridently piping bull-frogs. The thin, shining line of the Miskatonic’s upper reaches has an oddly serpent-like suggestion as it winds close to the feet of the domed hills among which it rises.       As the hills draw nearer, one heeds their wooded sides more than their stone-crowned tops. Those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously that one wishes they would keep their distance, but there is no road by which to escape them. Across a covered bridge one sees a small village huddled between the stream and the vertical slope of Round Mountain, and wonders at the cluster of rotting gambrel roofs bespeaking an earlier architectural period than that of the neighbouring region. It is not reassuring to see, on a closer glance, that most of the houses are deserted and falling to ruin, and that the broken-steepled church now harbours the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet. One dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge, yet there is no way to avoid it. Once across, it is hard to prevent the impression of a faint, malign odour about the village street, as of the massed mould and decay of centuries. It is always a relief to get clear of the place, and to follow the narrow road around the base of the hills and across the level country beyond till it rejoins the Aylesbury pike. Afterward one sometimes learns that one has been through Dunwich.      Outsiders visit Dunwich as seldom as possible, and since a certain season of horror all the signboards pointing toward it have been taken down. The scenery, judged by any ordinary aesthetic canon, is more than commonly beautiful; yet there is no influx of artists or summer tourists. Two centuries ago, when talk of witch-blood, Satan-worship, and strange forest presences was not laughed at, it was the custom to give reasons for avoiding the locality. In our sensible age—since the Dunwich horror of 1928 was hushed up by those who had the town’s and the world’s welfare at heart—people shun it without knowing exactly why. Perhaps one reason—though it cannot apply to uninformed strangers—is that the natives are now repellently decadent, having gone far along that path of retrogression so common in many New England backwaters. They have come to form a race by themselves, with the well-defined mental and physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding. The average of their intelligence is woefully low, whilst their annals reek of overt viciousness and of half-hidden murders, incests, and deeds of almost unnamable violence and perversity. The old gentry, representing the two or three armigerous families which came from Salem in 1692, have kept somewhat above the general level of decay; though many branches are sunk into the sordid populace so deeply that only their names remain as a key to the origin they disgrace. Some of the Whateleys and Bishops still send their eldest sons to Harvard and Miskatonic, though those sons seldom return to the mouldering gambrel roofs under which they and their ancestors were born.      No one, even those who have the facts concerning the recent horror, can say just what is the matter with Dunwich; though old legends speak of unhallowed rites and conclaves of the Indians, amidst which they called forbidden shapes of shadow out of the great rounded hills, and made wild orgiastic prayers that were answered by loud crackings and rumblings from the ground below. In 1747 the Reverend Abijah Hoadley, newly come to the Congregational Church at Dunwich Village, preached a memorable sermon on the close presence of Satan and his imps; in which he said:      “It must be allow’d, that these Blasphemies of an infernall Train of Daemons are Matters of too common Knowledge to be deny’d; the cursed Voices of Azazel and Buzrael, of Beelzebub and Belial, being heard now from under Ground by above a Score of credible Witnesses now living. I my self did not more than a Fortnight ago catch a very plain Discourse of evill Powers in the Hill behind my House; wherein there were a Rattling and Rolling, Groaning, Screeching, and Hissing, such as no Things of this Earth cou’d raise up, and which must needs have come from those Caves that only black Magick can discover, and only the Divell unlock.”      Mr. Hoadley disappeared soon after delivering this sermon; but the text, printed in Springfield, is still extant. Noises in the hills continued to be reported from year to year, and still form a puzzle to geologists and physiographers.      Other traditions tell of foul odours near the hill-crowning circles of stone pillars, and of rushing airy presences to be heard faintly at certain hours from stated points at the bottom of the great ravines; while still others try to explain the Devil’s Hop Yard—a bleak, blasted hillside where no tree, shrub, or grass-blade will grow. Then too, the natives are mortally afraid of the numerous whippoorwills which grow vocal on warm nights. It is vowed that the birds are psychopomps lying in wait for the souls of the dying, and that they time their eerie cries in unison with the sufferer’s struggling breath. If they can catch the fleeing soul when it leaves the body, they instantly flutter away chittering in daemoniac laughter; but if they fail, they subside gradually into a disappointed silence.      These tales, of course, are obsolete and ridiculous; because they come down from very old times. Dunwich is indeed ridiculously old—older by far than any of the communities within thirty miles of it. South of the village one may still spy the cellar walls and chimney of the ancient Bishop house, which was built before 1700; whilst the ruins of the mill at the falls, built in 1806, form the most modern piece of architecture to be seen. Industry did not flourish here, and the nineteenth-century factory movement proved short-lived. Oldest of all are the great rings of rough-hewn stone columns on the hill-tops, but these are more generally attributed to the Indians than to the settlers. Deposits of skulls and bones, found within these circles and around the sizeable table-like rock on Sentinel Hill, sustain the popular belief that such spots were once the burial-places of the Pocumtucks; even though many ethnologists, disregarding the absurd improbability of such a theory, persist in believing the remains Caucasian."]}
{"id": "EN043", "pair": ["Professors Schultz and his entire team had reunited the night their space probe The Nautilus, was floating towards a landmark, it has gone farther than any other space probe. Oh what wonderful things they would discover from that point onward. Each had their own ideals of what they would find and prove that there might be more than what others in their field so strongly believed.For the deeply religious young man, Geralds, who entered the program through luck and his computer skills at twenty-four, he thought that they would find God.Schultz mocked such an idea. He and the majority of the team believed that such more galaxies would be found, hopefully they would include inhabited planets that they could attempt to contact.But one amongst them was nervous. George Sunderland, an old resident of Portland Rhode Island, he was an astro-nut like the rest of them, but on the side, it was revealed some time after their project jettisoned into space, that during down times in one field, he worked in another. And his other, strange field was the occult.\"Fhtagn,\" He breathed under his breath. \"Fhtagn, fhtagn, fhtagn.\"He chanted, hoping that it would protect him. Granted, he reminded himself prior to this that The Nautilus did not go between Hydra and Argo Navis, but the thought still scared him.On the machines before them, it showed exactly where it was. When it reached the landmark, were there cheers, the sounds of champagne popping, and congratulations were shared once more.On the large monitors before them, stars were few and far in between that it was as if they were traveling away from them and not moving towards anymore after them.Geralds was the first to point this out. He was also the first to see the mult-colored aurora that one would never expect to see in space.\"Its like the surface of a bubble,\" Andrea, second oldest member to Schultz stated.Schultz scoffed and was beginning his rant against her, when The Nautilus floated past the aurora and found darkness. A void darker than space itself, yet just light enough due to iridescent orbs that floated in a semi-orderly orbital around an unknown object.\"What is this place?\" Andrea asked.\"Not what, Andrea,\" A voice grated through nowhere. \"But who?\"A giant glowing bubble appeared before the camera. Geralds stood up, overjoyed; he exclaimed his love for God and happiness at finding him. But the grating voice merely chuckled.\"No, Geralds,\" It said, sounding like a six year old and twenty year old and sixty year old man speaking together. \"Not God; at least, not your Christian god. I am, and Sunderland will confirm this,\" The man shivered at his name. \"Yog-Sothoth; past, present, future…Time itself, is all within me.\"\"But what is this?\" Andrea asked.\"This is me.\" The multi-layered voice said. \"What you see is a form of mine. The Gate; right Sunderland.\"All eyes turned to their cowering companion. With a few inhales of the nose, he nodded, a whimper escaping him.\"And within each bubble is a plain; a piece of the bigger picture.\"\"And whats that?\" Schultz asked.\"That your universe; your world; your reality is expanding and shrinking in what-for your mental stability-well say random order.\"\"Preposterous!\" Schultz snapped.Yog-Sothoth chuckled, the intertwined voices sounding exotic over the speakers. It was not malignant-it sounded good natured compared to what Sunderland had expected.\"You see those two bubbles sticking together?\"No one spoke, but there was a sense that there did not have to be. That he could see them as well as hear them. Unsettling though it was, the information presented to them was to the same effect. Poor Sunderland seemed to have already cracked under the circumstances; cowering under a desk.\"They are other universes. Other galaxies; some inhabited, some not. But when they intertwine like that, the barrier of the bubble fades, allowing them to seemingly overlap. Like a continuation of itself. Your own has done so with many of them and has been one of a few to be graced with the central hub, so to speak.\"Schultz was finding this hard to swallow. Being a man of science; something like this was a freak accident not hard fact…Until now, since it was staring them in the face. Leaving skepticism behind; he found infinite possibilities. Keeping his mind wide open seemed to help a little, though. After all, science was still discovering new things almost everyday.\"Whats in the central hub?\" Geralds asked.\"Rlyeh,\" Came the instant reply.At that, Sunderland let out a scream. No one paid him any mind, though, for they were, for a brief second that in the scheme of things that could be said that it did not happen, overcome with primal urges and long lost images transmitted thousands upon thousands of generations before themselves.\"Sunderland,\" Yog-Sothoth said. \"Do not be frightened. Nothing can hurt you right now.\"Sunderland laughed long and hard. Everyone became uneasy except their translucent, shining friend.\"Right now he says.\" Sunderland cracked up, stuttering phrases together in a jumble of unheard sentences.\"If you wish to know more, Schultz, may I ask that you turn The Nautilus in that direction.\" The bubble seemed to turn to the right. \"Theres someone who will do a better job at explaining things in a-and dont be offended by this-lemans terms.\"Goaded on by what the bubble said, the satellite took off to the right. Everyone but Sunderland waited in bated breath at the edge of their seat. Then an insane, cacophonous symphony of flutes was heard.Sunderland snapped out of his babbling mess and stood abruptly, dashing towards Schultz.\"We have to stop this!\"\"We cant,\" Geralds began.\"The Nautilus moves according to projection, we didnt have the financial ability to control it back when we made it.\" Andrea finished.Sunderland made a warrior cry as he ran towards the screen. He beat at it, breaking it in places, but the image still shown through.\"No! No! No!\" He said between beatings. But the image never disappeared, but was, thankfully, distorted.There came a sound of bumping into something beneath the louder cacophony flutes. Sunderland saw an eye open. An eye that was never supposed to open. The Nautilus turned away due to impact, but the damage was done. Sunderland was in a fit of hysterics, writhing on the floor, laughing as his mouth foamed.He looked into the eye of chaos and it stared back with a mind blowing intensity. The distorted image shown next was of bubbles stacking upon themselves and became a vertical line orbiting around the central hub. But they popped.The media was in a frenzy. Children were amazed at seeing real life Pokémon in their back yard. Three teens who broke down in the middle of nowhere found a camp that was not there before and were killed by a man in a hockey mask. Teens who lived on Elm Street started to die in their dreams. A couple were eaten by a giant white worm in Perfection, Nevada. Reports of Batman fighting the Joker were rampant in New York. In Louisiana, there was a report of a man covered in moss and roots walking in the swamp.In London, there were sightings of a man in a Guy Fawkes mask walking around in shadows and on roofs.In the Middle East there were reports of Orcs raiding caves.(1) But Japan had gotten it worst. Godzilla attacks, a strange yet beautiful rider on a mechanical horse, an orange clad ninja, and giant robot fights became an everyday event.\"The world as we knew it is gone!\" Sunderland screamed in his padded cell in Arkham Asylum. \"It popped! Just like a bubble!\"", "In relating the circumstances which have led to my confinement within this refuge for the demented, I am aware that my present position will create a natural doubt of the authenticity of my narrative. It is an unfortunate fact that the men who watch over me in this infernal building are too limited by their mental vision to weigh with patience and intelligence isolated phenomena such as that which I have experienced. All of the men, that is, with the exception of one, a Mister Slater, to whom I have related my story, and who has agreed to have it published. Men of broader intellect know that there is no sharp distinction betwixt the real and the unreal; that all things appear as they do only by virtue of the delicate individual physical and mental media through which we are made conscious of them.My name is Eldritch Fenton, and my tale is begins in the forest with my friend Joseph and a person named Riley Marsh, whom I had long believed to be a young girl. I had been infatuated with the pale-skin, brown-eyed, and raven-haired girl for around a full year now. Of course, so had my friend Joseph, for an almost equal period of time. We were riding our bikes through the lush woods under a gray sky one September afternoon when I turned around to notice Rileys sudden absence. We called for her in this part of the forest, hitherto unknown to us, but could not locate the girl.After just around half an hour, me and Joseph happened upon a terrible discovery. Buried in the side of a cliff on the opposite side of a lake was a large metal construct, that I would later discover was built by no earthen hands, with no earthen tools, of no earthen material, for no earthen purpose. A rusted metal bridge extended from the construct across the pond. We foolishly entered.Upon our entry, it was blatant by the sheer size of the stairwell, the height of what appeared o be computer consoles, and the mass of alien hieroglyphs littered on the walls and ceiling that this ship, as I had determined it to be, was not designed for use by human beings. A colossal cylinder stood in the center of the chamber, a strange energy, almost alive, emanating from it.My mind exploded suddenly. I could feel the presence of many slumbering creatures throughout the ancient vessel. Our unwanted presence in a piece of their world had disturbed them from their dreams. I could feel many more ship like this one, older than the planet Earth itself, scattered over this planet. I saw visions of terrible creatures unlike anything indigenous to our small, insignificant world. I saw worlds, in their entirety, populated by things of all forms, and of colors unknown to the eyes of man.I hadnt noticed that my mental shock had caused me to collapse to the floor, or that Joseph had come to my aid. The small boy tried to lift me, but I had to do most of the work with my own strength. Thats when Rileys beautiful, soft voice came into my mind.Kill him, she said within my thoughts. Destroy him, and we can be together for the rest of time. Given the strain the ordeal had on my mind, and the appeal of the result, I happily took up a piece of rubble from the floor and obliged. His screams as I broke his bones barely seemed important until after the event had taken place. Even now, his death at my hands has little effect on me. Though a recent realization, I always remember having nothing for contempt for the boy whose life had just been dashed by the rock wielded by me.The object of my affections appeared behind me. I turned to meet her beautiful face. It was perfectly as I remembered it, with the exception of here eyes, which had turned from an unremarkable brown to a majestic rose red. She touched my face and looked at the corpse on the cold, metal floor.\"Good. I never cared for him anyway.\" She chuckled maliciously. Then something simultaneously thrilling and horrifying happened. A pair of lumps rose in the back of her shirt. A pair of octopi-like tentacles then extended from her back like wings and began touching the corpse tenderly. The tendrils split at their ends and covered the cold shell of a body completely for several seconds. She screamed and her color came to her once pale skin. The tentacles receded and Josephs body was nowhere to be found.\"That was good, Eldritch.\" She laughed girlishly. \"But Im going to need more than that if you want to be with me forever.\" She flipped her hair and waked away. I followed her.That night my dreams were haunted by the same images I was struck with in the spacecraft. I saw monsters of flesh, metal, and energy on strange worlds never before seen by human beings. I saw myself taking the life of the little wretch Joseph over and over and over again. Mostly I saw the beautiful face of the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. Our minds were connected now. I could feel her thoughts and see her sights. We communicated with each other throughout the night. It was the best surge of emotions I had ever experienced.The following afternoon I had been out walking when I had taken my next life. Josephs death had been in the papers that morning, as well as on the local news. Only Riley and I knew the truth, however. I thought about everything that happened yesterday when Butch Robertson, the local bully, turned from around a corner, pounding his right fist into his left hand.\"Well, well, well.\" The mountainous boy said. \"Look what we have here. I noticed there was no transaction at lunch today. Why is that? Am I not good enough to deserve your payment? Hmm? Do I not deserve it? Well, then. I suppose well have to do this the hard way.\"He ran and swung at me. Feeling an uncontrollable urge to kill for my love again, I dodged out of the way and pushed him down the steep slope into a group of trees. He was still alive, though. He tried to stand up, but his leg appeared to be broken. He screamed and cursed at me from below, before he started trembling at the sight of two long, green tendrils. The appendages enveloped him and performed the same arcane process they performed on Joseph.That was wonderful, Eldritch. But I still need a little more, love. She laughed cutely. I had to get more bodies for her. Otherwise she would stop loving me, and all of my hard work would have been in vain!So I continued for a month. I preyed upon the small, the weak, the sick. I felt abominable for my actions. But the importance of the lives of these animals did not concern me as much as the welfare of Riley, or Ygtthaa , as I learned her true name to be on her home world. She needed me to kill for the meaningless animals for her, and I was more than happy to oblige.She also gave me a book. It was a strange book. The Necronomicon. She said it was by a man named Abdul Alhazred a long time ago. Though I could not at first, my present state has rendered me able to translate its arcane symbols and language. It contains mention of the \"Old Ones,\" the species to which Riley belonged. They had been here a very long time. And I was helping them reawaken by feeding Riley. She promised I would be spared when they were at full power, and I would be kept as her husband.But then that night came. I was out gathering more food for Riley. The town was in total panic now, but it didnt matter to me. It was late when I arrived at my empty, silent house. As soon as I heard my dog whimpering, a ghastly thought occurred to me. I ran into my room to find Rileys tentacles retracting. Her skin was now healthy looking, and her eyes were now a vibrant but terrible blood red. Two reptilian wings sprouted from her back and her now more numerous tendrils hung freely. I stared in terror at her, almost at tears.\"Aw, come on! I was hungry! Please forgive me? I love you!\" She pleaded. I ran. I ran to the only place I knew where to run.I reached the extraterrestrial ship in about a half an hour. I climbed the massive steps. I could feel Riley behind me, flying with her newly rediscovered wings. Acting quickly, I took up a piece of rubble larger than the one I took Josephs life with. I couldnt reach the computer consoles, but I began to destroy the lower parts of the machines. I heard creatures begin to awaken and crawl through the vents. The energy from the large cylinder in the chamber surged. It beckoned for me to see what was inside. When enough damage was done to the machines, and I could feel Riley nearing me, I walked to the cylinder and stared upward. It opened, almost as if on its own, and revealed its secrets to me.What I saw was so unimaginably, unequivocally horrifying, I cannot bring myself to describe it thoroughly. It challenged my perception of everything. My knowledge was refuted. My idea of right and wrong was destroyed. All I knew was that we mean nothing to the universe, we earthlings. And the eyes! Oh, dear God! The eyes!I awoke later, strangely unscathed, in the wreckage of the ship. It had been obliterated. Destroyed, in a great breath of fire. I was collected by the local police and the ship was searched by military units in green armor. I was shipped to an asylum near Miskatonic University in Arkham, Massachutesetts. Here, Mr. Slater has agreed to write down my story. I leave you with this knowledge. The old ones are real. Riley, Ygtthaa, is still killing people. I still feel her. She still begs me to come help her. But the strangest part is, in some deep, dark part of my mind, that I dare not visit……I still love her."]}
{"id": "EN069", "pair": ["Day 1-I never would imagine such thing would happen, in this diary I will document my strange and disturbing events. Once I was a normal respected teacher at Miskatonic, and then a member of this \"great race\" appears and teleports me to this place…its just too surreal, this place is a gigantic library, whit knowledge of humanity and more…this large creature its just disgusting, I just never saw something like this, its just bizarre. The flowers are just biologically impossible, but they are there. I am a prisoner? This place is huge, the race its big! Like a small building, I just imagine how impossibly big an entire city would be…I am like a mouse in a skyscraper. I try my best to sleep…god have mercy upon me. I have difficulty knowing what is day and what is night…because there are not windows, I have a theory that this place is underground. A few minutes after wandering around, my captor opens the massive door, ah I have forgotten, this room is almost alone without objects of my size, the only thing here is a giant sized TV with a typewriter on it. What kind of technology these creatures possess? I see that the giant clicks these claws constantly…why? Its some sort of communication? Suddenly he throws to me a metal box with a button on top of it, \"what sort of thing is this, creature?\" I ask. The giant just clicks this right claw. Without any other option I push the small cylinder, and nothing noticeable happens. But then it makes a long series of clicks again and the box suddenly begins to…talk: \"hello Wilhelm. I am a Yithnian, and I want your help. I have seen with horror that a god will crash-land on earth in two weeks! He is trapped in a suit that will retrain this great and immeasurable power. I will travel in time to bring him to you so we can begin our project\" suddenly he disappeared in an after-image. The thing he said…it was unbelievable a god exists, and he wants my help.Day…2 (i suppose) I been alone in this blank room for 4 hours…and when I was taken it was 1:30. Ok that is not the point. In this room there some sort of big book shells that dwarf by a few inches the aliens. I have opened the door to reveal that I was right, if this would be a city of gigantic size I would be like a mouse. Thousands of skyscrapers roam the underground dome that sustains the cave. This is just massive. One of the tallest buildings on earth will be like an electric floor fan compared to these hulks. Its just frightening to try to hide from these monsters. I still dont get why my captor doesnt appear yet. The buildings are made from a metal that is am mesh of golden with gray, and almost every one of them is rectangular. Three minutes remain of this wait and I see that the yith creature has returned, with a strange being in this arm. Also a book of my size; the creature started to click and the machine started to speak: \"I ask forgiveness Wilhelm, the time machine broke and I needed to fix it. Here it is…the great lord of the Outer gods, the blind idiot entity that everyone fears: Azathoth! My luck, our luck could not be greater my friend! He was trapped in the technology of my people and Mi-Gos we can make him anything we want!\" after handing me the book I have a better look at the \"God\" before me. He had a suit with long limbs; this head was highly (and horrifyingly) similar to the shape of the tall Flatiron Building in New York, in this top there were two small triangles that made the illusion of horns or wolf like ears. Little red lines in both sides of the face, (I suppose eyes) the helmet also it was colored silver. I also notice that this body has a light brown straightjacket like appearance. This right and left hands have black gloves (I suppose) with slightly long conical golden claws half of the fingers. These feet and legs are even more bizarre: black to the knees with silver to the lateral malleolus. The feet are the most structurally insane: it looks like a golden flat spike. It appears that this creature is unconscious. The book has revealed me some clues: Azathoth he is the most powerful entity in our universe, also the creator of a creator of other gods! The yiths are the race of my captor. They want to use the knowledge of my race to their disposal, what one? I dare not to put it in this diary…it would make anyone insane. The creature \"spoken\" to my again about why I am here; \"I want to give to the Outer God a new chance, one to redeem him/itself to use it as a tool for good. I will train you in a place that I made where time is infinite, where you dont need to eat, you will not exhaust, where you will not age. There I will make you a super intelligent being, due to the fact that there is technology of my race you will need to learn it. And you will make Azathoth something more than human.\" After that a door on a wall suddenly appeared, the place inside of it was blank grey. I am surprised of what I will do…I will create something to fight the unknown evil of this world! We will make this monster my monster! The yith told me that the place where we will go is applied named: Infinitely Timed Room.Day 3- the I.T.R. was excellent as a place for learning. I reckon I was there for 200 months. But I am fine to say the least. I finally learned how to manipulate the suit. It was revealed to me that there is a cube that reduces size inside of the helmet. There is a computer inside of that cube that can be modified. If I do that I can change Azathoth into a thinking creature. Also I will make him learn how to change the suit into anything he wants. I get a closer look at the monster and I can assume that he is still unconscious, or he doesnt know how to move. Thanks to a machine I built inside the I.T.R. a metal glob that can change into any human or eldritch tool I call it the anytool. I can mentally command it and only me, I change it into a buzz saw that cuts the center of the helmet. I see with awe that there are two metal cubes inside it. The one on the right has a circular window I see with my own mortal eyes what is in there: the thumb–sized daemon sultan himself. He was shaped like a tridimensional ellipse, in this surface it was covered with something similar to eggs of a fish or an amphibian, they divided the creature into two tones: in the right there where white \"eggs\" and only 3 black ones, there were 4 spiked eggs and white five tubes that have mouths. In the left there are only black eggs and 3 spiked white ones, 2 big human like jaws were located in the far left. Behind it there where mangled tentacles and claws. I see all this thanks to the anytool that I shaped into a microscope.The boxes where lead colored and they were 7cm tall and 7cm breadth. The one that is located upside is the one that constrains him and these powers, there is a mirror in the floor of the cube, the downer cube creates an incredibly thin ray that points into the mirror of the upper cube (they are epilated into a vertical position) that ray is the one that maintains this concurrent size. I cut the cube where the visor is and I slowly modify it.Day 4-I finally finalized the modification, and I closed the helmet. I created a level system: Level 1 makes him use a small bit of this power, with strength capable of lifting 50 tons. Level 2 makes him capable of creating creatures of this own, and this strength are enough powerful to level 10 buildings, Level 3…this one makes him use a quarter of this real power, he is capable of destroying a world with energy based blasts. And this physical strength is unmeasurable. Also I programed the cube (that works like a brain for Azathoth) to only to obey me, but to follow orders of any successor or member of my family.After a few hours the former god awakens and these first words are understandable: \"where…I am, what I am?\" this voice is deep and stern. I shudder what this reaction will be when I tell him the truth. Thankfully I made the upper cube make the thump sized monster a fast learner. \"My name is Wilhelm Smift, your master. Your name is Azathoth.\" The knight like creature stares at me; \"yes…Thou art. But please answer me who am i?\" \"You were a powerful creature, a god. But technological creatures transferred you into a body that constrains your power. Thankfully I have modified it to have a mind that thinks, that talks, without me you would be a blind idiot, all powerful Imbecile! You were a leader of other gods but you never made to them any commands, you where mindless. Now in turn serve me Azathoth, I will make you a tool for justice!\" the creature bows before me, but then to my fear I hear a chilling laugh, \"Why are you laughing daemon sultan?\" he talks to me slowly \"I will become a tool for extermination, isnt it master? I will become a machine only made for killing…ISNT IT MASTER?!\" he suddenly approaches me, whit these arms wide open. \"YOU MADE ME SOMETHING BETTER THAN A MINDLESS FOOL!\" he screams to the ceiling. Then he lungs at me, I expected an attack but the demon instead…hugs me. \"I cant be more grateful\" I dont know what to say, my wishes were answered, but I dread to know why such creature is happy to comply with requests for killing.", "A few weeks after the attack, The Campus of Miskatonic has been repaired, but due to constant problems of security the place is in a state where there are not students and the fate of the school is unknown. \"Sire…that thing wants to talk to you\" inside the echo of the one of a few teachers that decided to stay and discuss what the will be of this Miskatonic. Johnathan Clarke tries to silence this caller \"dont say anything you fool, if they know I have an outer god, they will do anything to use it in the wrong ways\" –\"but you are the only one that can command him, oh…when I think bout it they can persuade you to use it.\" –\"exactly!\" their conversation was interrupted when a grizzled voice started the mind of John: \"come, I want to know the new orders\" the young teacher moves to the basement \"Azathoth…its been weeks since I saw you, how you been doing?\" the canned god chuckled \"fine doin nothin but wait till you came, my young sire, in fact I have an idea, what if I go to Innsmouth and I kill dagon to stop further attacks\" –\"no that would be a terrible idea. What if we both go and try to talk to them, you know some sort of treaty we could have peace\" the outer god laughs \"Master! Such an altruistic nature! And far too foolish\" –\"did you say something?\" the cylindrical monster says nothing and continues to listen: \"we will go anyways, can you change into something small?\" suddenly Azathoths red and cylindrical form started to melt without any source of heat, just leaving this \"brain\" the container cubes. \"Its this enough small for you?\"John goes to this home close to the Miskatonic River; he carefully puts this bag in this bed, and putting out Azathoth, \"well, can I change into my normal self, sire?\" the young man grabbed the two epilated cubes, looked into the small circular window of the cube on the top and nodded, \"very well, careful now\" John put the cube in the floor and it started to reconfigure itself into this red, mechanical and cylinder shaped form, \"so, what will we do?\" azathoth, asked, \"well I will try to talk to their leader, if that doesnt work you will kill both Dagon and Hydra, I just want to know why did they attacked us\" the metallic creature patted this back \"anything for you sire, talkin bout yourself, can you tell me about you?\" John seated on the bed: \"well, I… (Damn, if he knows I am \"adopted\" he will kill me!)W-well, I lived in Innsmouth for a few years, then when I grew up my father decided to move to Kingsport, I never saw my mother, he told me that she could kill me, maybe she was a terrible and ungrateful bitch\" Azathoth decided to speak \"I wonder if she was…\" he trailed off after thinking about what he was about to say, \"if she was what? A prostitute?\" Azathoth \"nodded\" by moving this body. \"For the rest of the day I need to pack, Jesus, I expect not to have any problems with the villagers\" Azathoth then said; \"sire…why you want to save inhuman creatures? Or even negotiate with them? Rubbish…no, Bullshit! They hate humans, and when they saw that investigator they knew that we were the ones that called, so its a matter of fact that they felt we were a menace, your little travel to innsmouth its pointless master!\" john then raised from the bed and looked the god directly to this cat like iris, he shivered but he gained some courage to speak to him: \"no, its not, and dont dare to disobey me azathoth. I want peace between eldritch creatures and humans imagine the possibilities! We could get better technology, better understanding of this universe!\" this mechanic companion chuckled: \"dont be silly, the eldritch just want the earth for themselves. Gods and aliens are very different: the outer and elders dont give a flying fuck bout humans, they see us as useless ants, even my son amuses himself with the lot of you, aliens on the other hand want to use us as things to guinea pigs (well the intelligent ones)\" after a few minutes of silence night comes and john goes to sleep. While azathoth goes into this box form. \"I expect to make those deep ones into deep fish sticks tomorrow. hahaha\"The next day john goes in boat to innsmouth, after a voyage of an entire day. then after that they got on a train. The next day after that john arrived in Innsmouth, he saw that the place has little to no changes, the buildings were crude and crocked, some of them were derelict, and the habitants were mutated humans. The sky was grey to make the mood even more depressing. John decided to talk to a habitant, \"sire, can you tell me where I can the mayor of this place? I need to tell him something really important\" the man like many of this brethren was human like, but this eyes were close to popping out of this skull, this skin was greyish, this lips were thicker than the normal man and he had no hair, \"what? You are a foreigner, why you should talk to our mayor? Are you some kind of important person o what?\" –\"Im not \"important\" by any rich standards but…no forget about it\" Clarke decided to sit on a nearby bench to take out the cubes, they were gun metal grey with vertical lines sculpted on each one, he looked at the cube and started to think \"Azathoth…if you can hear me confirm it\" –\"yes master, what are your commands?\" –\"shape shift your box with some legs, I will ask where is the place where the ruler of this place lives, but you will convince him to talk to me, I am clear?\" –\"crystal…not need to worry, I can convince him by words… (shifts the corners of this cube to muscular legs with three digits) or by force\" he quickly moves to a bush close to this master, he walked to other citizen \"I want to know the place where the mayor lives or he is in the most of time, you know, to interview him\" -\"w-well…he always is in the building that is the Esoteric Order of Dagon, a few blocks at the right, I thin is in the center of the town\" Clarke continued walking, he sees that this servant is not present. \"Outer god, or I am very stupid and I lost you, or you are very fast\" –\"it would be the latter\" he saw the cube in this hands. \"We are close, stay alert\" after a few minutes of asking for directions they find the infamous building, it was unlike some of the other depressing and colorless buildings, it was tall and with a rusted cooper coloration.\"Ok, try to be the most menacing possible, make them know what will happen if the give me a no\" John Clarke said as he tossed the gunmetal grey cubes to the wall of the building. \"Sire, I am a 7 ft. tall mechanoid, with a knife the same size as your head, I have a heavy machine gun that is the same size of my body, and my eye made you tremble like a kid…if that is not menacing, then, what the fuck is?\" he crawls in an impossible speed, almost defying gravity. He enters a window and sees that there are a decent amount of people seating in chairs, in the pulpit there is a deep one in a cage. He sees a man on the center with a hood he hears the leader doing a speech: \"my brothers, I have heard that someone is in the streets asking for me, maybe he is in league with that investigator! Maybe he is the reason why our brothers\" he was interrupted when he saw Azathoth revealing himself in this mechanical form, it is sort of different now: there was no rust in this body; the red was more vibrant now and glossy, this cloth skirt now resembles a red trench coat tail. This \"chest\" has written on it on white letters: \"Eldritch Exterminator\" this rectangular shield has \"A+M\" written on it. \"Well gentlemen, who of you is the mayor?\" they pointed guns to him, \"what and who are you?!\" the leader asked. \"What? Why do you answer my question, with a question?! Who the hell does that?\" they shot, all of them. Azathoth unblinking gaze hammered their souls, \"he…HE IS NOT FAZED BY THE FIRE!\" one of them yelled. \"Yeah, but you have fazed fire?\" the outer monster said and then a cylindrical heat beam shot out of this single eye, it cuts every single goon like a hot knife to butter. The only one left is the one on the center. After that display of power and dread he politely asks the \"mayor\" \"care to do me a favor?\"\"Uh? Someone has left the building…and he is approaching me!\" Clarke though as the mayor with this hood down walked to him \"w-welcome to innsmouth…Mister Clarke…you wanted to ask me why I sent those hired guns to your university, please the townspeople wanted me to kill! Its not my fault, is theirs!\"-\"you are the mayor, the authority of this place, they must control your people, they must obey…or maybe there is a higher authority here?\" the mayor was getting more nervous after John said this, \"WHAT?! Sire, dont say things like that…there is no-\" the young teacher interrupted him \"oh yes? Why should I believe the same person that sent those goons to kill us, why should I believe the same person that worships Dagon, sire I think the big fish himself is calling the shots and not you?\" suddenly all the mutated fish people looked directly at the bench the mayor and john were sitting on. \"Oh…they heard us…Azathoth\" the citizens retreated and then returned with all sorts of weapons: pitchforks, knifes, shotguns, revolvers etc. they slowly approached the two, aiming their guns, reading themselves for using their blunt instruments, after all a mayor in Innsmouth is not important, as long as Dagon and Hydra live. \"So, me versus the lot of ya, well its unfair, for you\" azathoth suddenly jumped a window and landed on one of the closest citizen. \"Sire this needs more than level one, I recommend you to use…two\" –\"proceed\" this thin black pupil began to change to a shape identical to a two \"thanks…this reminds me of the first time I talked to your father, and like that time…I am very, very grateful\" he got out of this backpack this trusty CLAXXTON heavy machine gun. Then he touched this masters shoulder and he disappeared from view. They were about to overwhelm him but he simply shoot in a spin, the bullets completely destroyed this enemies. They tried to fire back but nothing fazed him, the outer god started to run through the mass of people with this harmonic knife, the sound of electric guitar feedback coming from the sharp instrument.\"Where I am?\" he asked himself just to see around him and noticed \"oh I am outside of that damn town, thank gods hahaha…Jesus this mission of mine was a fiasco\" he noticed that something was purring in the back of this head, and then he felt like something was ripping this neck, he falls to the ground in pain, realizing that he has now difficulty to breathe. Meanwhile this servant was having fun slaughtering every single mutated deep one he saw, \"why you keep head-buttin your own species, why?\" he though while using a head with a vertebral spine from a corpse as a bat around heavily injured deep ones, one of them appears behind him, climbs to this back and stabs this eye with a wood pencil, \"hey imbecile, I am already blind\" as he said this in a deadpan way he throws him to the ground and squashed this face with a stomp. As he fights this way he summons two moon beasts to cause mayhem around the city. He quickly regenerates this eye and begins to grab a small house, and then throws it to a crowd of three that had shotguns and pitchforks, the moons beasts were destroying every building they saw, but suddenly they saw a figure running out of their way, the second moon beast grabbed it and prepared to take a bit of this head, \"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!\" they heard this dreadful master, hearing him like that means a painful death. He stopped this act of eating this unlucky victim. \"Listen you tentacle face, this is a HUMAN, we dont kill those except when they oppose us! So put. Him. In. the. Ground. Slowly\" he complied, \"in fact rescue all the humans you can and put them in a save area. If I see blood of Homo sapiens in you (points to him this harmonic knife) I will grab your intestines and shove them up your eyes\" he then used this heat vision to cut some of the confused mutants, the moon beast grabbed the human and ran to the outskirts of the city. Suddenly in the shore, two giants were approaching the devastated ground with enraged faces.\"OH YEAH!\" Azathoth yelled when he saw those two figures \"how dare you to kill our brothers and daughter?! You have the audacity to attack us unprovoked!\" the male giant roared in an alien language that only gods can understand. \"Kill him my loved! He is insulting our right to use these humans as we please!\" the female one said, \"Hydra, Dagon. Even I though you werent this stupid, but hey easier for me\" he jumped to a high that rivaled the two elder fishes, and then he kicked Dagon in the face; this wife on the other hand was fighting the two dream lands beasts. \"come on, try to ask who I am, why I am doing this, come on, you know you want to oversized cat food!\" the small cylinder said as he started to shot the eyes of this enemy from this hand (he was being grabbed by dagon) \"YOU INSOLENT\" he was interrupted when a knife came to this other eye. He noticed that the wife of Dagon was wiping the floor with one moon beast, literally. \"Aw hell no! I am the only one that can do that!\" he said as the knife came back to him and he without a problem cut the arm of this bigger enemy\" when he landed he started to run at a speed that was unbelievable, he practically made this way through hydras legs! She felt to the ground and the surviving beast grabbed the fallen monster and started to eat this face. He turned to see Dagon that was shocked and even horrified that this loved was being eaten alive \"YOU BASTARD!\" he yelled, he ran to azathoth that started to laugh insanely, and ran to this direction too. He grabbed this machinegun and shot at the belly of the beast, the deep one lord was getting weaker and weaker with the hole that the bullets were making. The trapped god jumped to the hole and started to carve with this knife, he made this way to the lungs, to the throat, and he was now in the jaws. \"Hey D-boy have you heard of knifes? Then here is a complete database, I expect your brain to handle this information\" azathoth said in glee and he started to destroy the brain in fast slashes.\"…Azathoth…I am…dying…help\" he heard this masters mental command and got out of this enemys skull, he quickly appeared in front…of a deep one in the same exact clothes as John Clarke."]}
{"id": "EN046", "pair": ["It was in Laguna, that city of mystery on the French-Italian border, that I met the man. The grimy, back-alley tavern, never full, was slowly emptying for the night. The table in front of me was vacated, and there he sat, across the room in the corner. What held my gaze, I suppose, was no one peculiarity of his in particular, but rather the totality, the sum.Even at a distance, it was arresting. Bloodshot eyes, still alert in their infinite weariness. The shine of a nervous perspiration upon the forehead and unshaven cheeks. A movement, an unnatural twitch of the lips. Hands which could not disguise a slight quivering as they clutched, in a white-knuckled grasp, the long-since emptied glass of ale. Whatever inner demons plagued his tortured psyche had transformed his once-handsome visage into the gray, grizzled countenance of one twice his senior.And yet, I was inexplicably drawn to him. How I came to be seated at his table, I dont recall. But he showed no surprise, no reaction of any kind, almost as though it were expected.Yet I could formulate no words, nor even ideas. We simply watched each other, he more intensely than I, until, at last, he spoke. \"Do you often dream, stranger?\" It was a hoarse and barely-perceptible susurration.I responded in the affirmative, to which he continued, as though to himself, \"Most people do. But some dreams, some dreams, they are much more, no? Perhaps some dreams, some special ones, perhaps they are, they could be a reflection, an echo, of… reality.\" He lifted his glass, only realizing it was empty when it was halfway to his lips.Not sure what to make of this, my response consisted of only a slight raise of the eyebrows, but it was enough to prod him further in his quivering, stuttering speech.\"There are some things we shouldnt know, I can tell you truly. I know, for I have seen, yes seen them. For years, stranger, I meditated on the metaphysical.\" At this, he absent-mindedly fingered a dirty talisman around his neck. \"You have meditated, perhaps? But I dont mean in the traditional way, no. In my sojourns, I sought to penetrate the deepest meanings, sought to comprehend the fundamental nature of reality itself… oh! Oh God!\"He laid his head face-down on the stained tabletop, his body wracked with silent spasms. After a moment, I gingerly grasped his shoulder, halfheartedly mumbling something polite about not taking dreams seriously. At this, he shot a hand across the table to clutch my wrist, whilst bringing his face to within a thumbs length of my own. I could clearly see the tiny, blood-red vessels which webbed the whites of his intense eyes; they almost seemed to pulsate.\"No! They can be real! I know…. I, I, I think I delved too deep one day. In my meditations, my mind cleared like never before, and understanding seemed to flow effortlessly. But something else happened, too. At night, the dreams, they began. Oh, always the same, night after night, and then by day, but clearer and clearer. A maddening cacophony of images and sounds, each indistinguishable from the others… and always in the background, an indistinct sense of familiarity, and fear. This went on, I dont know how many months. Dreams, meditations, memories, I could no longer tell the difference! I scarcely knew, knew who I even was anymore!\"He contracted into his chair whilst covering his face with both forearms, quietly sobbing for a time. And I, at a loss, could only say, \"But then…?\"He straightened, staring at me through wet, crimson eyes. \"But then… but then… It came. It….\" The man shut his eyes, and his posture seemed to straighten. For several minutes, he was absolutely still. His eyes blinked open. They seemed altered somehow, as if viewing an object in the far distance. And when he now spoke, his voice had no stutter, no hoarseness. It was ethereal, and lucid, almost preternaturally so.\"It came. At a time, during these dreams, piercing through the surreal cascade of visions, came to me one strikingly clear image, whereupon all else faded into a scarcely perceptible background static. How can it be described? It was as if all sound instantly contracted to the Source, from whence the image subsequently sprung, carried forth on tumescent rays of light through the formless sea of darkness.\"There was a shadowy land of antiquity, passing by at great speed, an immeasurable distance beneath me. And I, a dimensionless mote of consciousness in that sunless world under the star-decked sky, possessing only the sense of sight, and that coming to me but gradually.\"Over endless dark oceans of unfathomable depths I passed, and ranges of nameless mountains whose peaks stretched to bitter, unearthly heights. Then came primeval forests, and eternally shadowed plains. How long this voyage lasted, the blink of an eye or millennia uncountable, I could not speculate. Time as we comprehend it held no meaning in that oneiric dreamscape.And though I had not dreamt of this place before, that vague familiarity ever lurked in my subconscious, just out of reach.\"Yet at some point, I beheld a great, desolate city, unlike to any ever conceived. Impossibly vast, with thousands upon thousands of towering onyx edifices that clawed the upper reaches of the opaque sky. The architecture, the geometry—I couldnt begin to describe it. Among this jungle of arcologies were great, empty plazas—inland seas of themselves—dotted with bone-dry fountains and fantastically eerie sculptures.\"And silence. Silence so utterly complete that its essence was a positive quality in itself, rather than a lack of one.\"What was this vision—this elder city of darkness, which must have existed vigintillions of centuries before the first progenitors of terrestrial life blindly slithered their way out of the primordial ooze?\"All at once, before my eyeless vision, I was descending, no, plunging, through the canyons of the cyclopean monoliths. Plummeting with ever greater acceleration, I saw the ground open before me, prepared for the impact—but no! I passed through, continuing downwards, and here I saw that the city indeed extended beneath the surface, sublevel upon sublevel without end, so that I realized the upper part to have been the mere tip, the crown of a gargantuan urban iceberg.\"Through awesome subterranean cityscapes I passed on that interminable descent. Great industrial chasms, honeycombed vaults, bulkheads of solid rock, yawning cathedrals, labyrinths of twisting passages. As I went deeper, the vision became darker, the silence more profound, my speed slower, and my disquietude greater. And at the last, at the very foundation of foundations, I advanced through a straight, narrow passage of indeterminate length and minimal luminosity, until I came to a metal door, passed through, and found myself in a small, square room.\"And in this deepest of vaults, what do you suppose I beheld? What was there? Well, the answer to that is… nothing. Absolutely nothing. The chamber was completely empty. As confusion engulfed me, a throbbing seemed to build within my mind, slowly at first, and then stronger and stronger, until it snapped. In an instant, something in my genetic memory unlocked, and all was horribly clear.\"This room was mine. I knew it without the slightest shadow of a doubt. I had dwelt here, in some far-off age. Like the surreal, eldritch world to which it belonged, it was coeval with me, and I with it. But no sooner had this epiphany struck home than it was practically buried by a surging, unblockable avalanche of associated memories and experiences, my mind a bin filled to the brim, to excess, overflowing, floundering helplessly in the torrential current….\"The mans voice died away, and as he again lowered his head to the tabletop in anguish, it seemed he was reverted to his previous, wretched self. The lights in the tavern were dying. And I, scarcely able to fathom the enormity of his narratives implications, ventured merely to inquire, \"And this… vision. This world, did it come to you again in dreams?\"\"Nooooo!\" he moaned piteously. \"No! Not that one!\" And here, he actually clutched and yanked the hair on both sides of his head in utter agony, as if trying to remove it from his skull. His raw, maddened eyes fixed on me just once more.\"You see, It, It… It was only the first…!\"", "A few weeks after the attack, The Campus of Miskatonic has been repaired, but due to constant problems of security the place is in a state where there are not students and the fate of the school is unknown. \"Sire…that thing wants to talk to you\" inside the echo of the one of a few teachers that decided to stay and discuss what the will be of this Miskatonic. Johnathan Clarke tries to silence this caller \"dont say anything you fool, if they know I have an outer god, they will do anything to use it in the wrong ways\" –\"but you are the only one that can command him, oh…when I think bout it they can persuade you to use it.\" –\"exactly!\" their conversation was interrupted when a grizzled voice started the mind of John: \"come, I want to know the new orders\" the young teacher moves to the basement \"Azathoth…its been weeks since I saw you, how you been doing?\" the canned god chuckled \"fine doin nothin but wait till you came, my young sire, in fact I have an idea, what if I go to Innsmouth and I kill dagon to stop further attacks\" –\"no that would be a terrible idea. What if we both go and try to talk to them, you know some sort of treaty we could have peace\" the outer god laughs \"Master! Such an altruistic nature! And far too foolish\" –\"did you say something?\" the cylindrical monster says nothing and continues to listen: \"we will go anyways, can you change into something small?\" suddenly Azathoths red and cylindrical form started to melt without any source of heat, just leaving this \"brain\" the container cubes. \"Its this enough small for you?\"John goes to this home close to the Miskatonic River; he carefully puts this bag in this bed, and putting out Azathoth, \"well, can I change into my normal self, sire?\" the young man grabbed the two epilated cubes, looked into the small circular window of the cube on the top and nodded, \"very well, careful now\" John put the cube in the floor and it started to reconfigure itself into this red, mechanical and cylinder shaped form, \"so, what will we do?\" azathoth, asked, \"well I will try to talk to their leader, if that doesnt work you will kill both Dagon and Hydra, I just want to know why did they attacked us\" the metallic creature patted this back \"anything for you sire, talkin bout yourself, can you tell me about you?\" John seated on the bed: \"well, I… (Damn, if he knows I am \"adopted\" he will kill me!)W-well, I lived in Innsmouth for a few years, then when I grew up my father decided to move to Kingsport, I never saw my mother, he told me that she could kill me, maybe she was a terrible and ungrateful bitch\" Azathoth decided to speak \"I wonder if she was…\" he trailed off after thinking about what he was about to say, \"if she was what? A prostitute?\" Azathoth \"nodded\" by moving this body. \"For the rest of the day I need to pack, Jesus, I expect not to have any problems with the villagers\" Azathoth then said; \"sire…why you want to save inhuman creatures? Or even negotiate with them? Rubbish…no, Bullshit! They hate humans, and when they saw that investigator they knew that we were the ones that called, so its a matter of fact that they felt we were a menace, your little travel to innsmouth its pointless master!\" john then raised from the bed and looked the god directly to this cat like iris, he shivered but he gained some courage to speak to him: \"no, its not, and dont dare to disobey me azathoth. I want peace between eldritch creatures and humans imagine the possibilities! We could get better technology, better understanding of this universe!\" this mechanic companion chuckled: \"dont be silly, the eldritch just want the earth for themselves. Gods and aliens are very different: the outer and elders dont give a flying fuck bout humans, they see us as useless ants, even my son amuses himself with the lot of you, aliens on the other hand want to use us as things to guinea pigs (well the intelligent ones)\" after a few minutes of silence night comes and john goes to sleep. While azathoth goes into this box form. \"I expect to make those deep ones into deep fish sticks tomorrow. hahaha\"The next day john goes in boat to innsmouth, after a voyage of an entire day. then after that they got on a train. The next day after that john arrived in Innsmouth, he saw that the place has little to no changes, the buildings were crude and crocked, some of them were derelict, and the habitants were mutated humans. The sky was grey to make the mood even more depressing. John decided to talk to a habitant, \"sire, can you tell me where I can the mayor of this place? I need to tell him something really important\" the man like many of this brethren was human like, but this eyes were close to popping out of this skull, this skin was greyish, this lips were thicker than the normal man and he had no hair, \"what? You are a foreigner, why you should talk to our mayor? Are you some kind of important person o what?\" –\"Im not \"important\" by any rich standards but…no forget about it\" Clarke decided to sit on a nearby bench to take out the cubes, they were gun metal grey with vertical lines sculpted on each one, he looked at the cube and started to think \"Azathoth…if you can hear me confirm it\" –\"yes master, what are your commands?\" –\"shape shift your box with some legs, I will ask where is the place where the ruler of this place lives, but you will convince him to talk to me, I am clear?\" –\"crystal…not need to worry, I can convince him by words… (shifts the corners of this cube to muscular legs with three digits) or by force\" he quickly moves to a bush close to this master, he walked to other citizen \"I want to know the place where the mayor lives or he is in the most of time, you know, to interview him\" -\"w-well…he always is in the building that is the Esoteric Order of Dagon, a few blocks at the right, I thin is in the center of the town\" Clarke continued walking, he sees that this servant is not present. \"Outer god, or I am very stupid and I lost you, or you are very fast\" –\"it would be the latter\" he saw the cube in this hands. \"We are close, stay alert\" after a few minutes of asking for directions they find the infamous building, it was unlike some of the other depressing and colorless buildings, it was tall and with a rusted cooper coloration.\"Ok, try to be the most menacing possible, make them know what will happen if the give me a no\" John Clarke said as he tossed the gunmetal grey cubes to the wall of the building. \"Sire, I am a 7 ft. tall mechanoid, with a knife the same size as your head, I have a heavy machine gun that is the same size of my body, and my eye made you tremble like a kid…if that is not menacing, then, what the fuck is?\" he crawls in an impossible speed, almost defying gravity. He enters a window and sees that there are a decent amount of people seating in chairs, in the pulpit there is a deep one in a cage. He sees a man on the center with a hood he hears the leader doing a speech: \"my brothers, I have heard that someone is in the streets asking for me, maybe he is in league with that investigator! Maybe he is the reason why our brothers\" he was interrupted when he saw Azathoth revealing himself in this mechanical form, it is sort of different now: there was no rust in this body; the red was more vibrant now and glossy, this cloth skirt now resembles a red trench coat tail. This \"chest\" has written on it on white letters: \"Eldritch Exterminator\" this rectangular shield has \"A+M\" written on it. \"Well gentlemen, who of you is the mayor?\" they pointed guns to him, \"what and who are you?!\" the leader asked. \"What? Why do you answer my question, with a question?! Who the hell does that?\" they shot, all of them. Azathoth unblinking gaze hammered their souls, \"he…HE IS NOT FAZED BY THE FIRE!\" one of them yelled. \"Yeah, but you have fazed fire?\" the outer monster said and then a cylindrical heat beam shot out of this single eye, it cuts every single goon like a hot knife to butter. The only one left is the one on the center. After that display of power and dread he politely asks the \"mayor\" \"care to do me a favor?\"\"Uh? Someone has left the building…and he is approaching me!\" Clarke though as the mayor with this hood down walked to him \"w-welcome to innsmouth…Mister Clarke…you wanted to ask me why I sent those hired guns to your university, please the townspeople wanted me to kill! Its not my fault, is theirs!\"-\"you are the mayor, the authority of this place, they must control your people, they must obey…or maybe there is a higher authority here?\" the mayor was getting more nervous after John said this, \"WHAT?! Sire, dont say things like that…there is no-\" the young teacher interrupted him \"oh yes? Why should I believe the same person that sent those goons to kill us, why should I believe the same person that worships Dagon, sire I think the big fish himself is calling the shots and not you?\" suddenly all the mutated fish people looked directly at the bench the mayor and john were sitting on. \"Oh…they heard us…Azathoth\" the citizens retreated and then returned with all sorts of weapons: pitchforks, knifes, shotguns, revolvers etc. they slowly approached the two, aiming their guns, reading themselves for using their blunt instruments, after all a mayor in Innsmouth is not important, as long as Dagon and Hydra live. \"So, me versus the lot of ya, well its unfair, for you\" azathoth suddenly jumped a window and landed on one of the closest citizen. \"Sire this needs more than level one, I recommend you to use…two\" –\"proceed\" this thin black pupil began to change to a shape identical to a two \"thanks…this reminds me of the first time I talked to your father, and like that time…I am very, very grateful\" he got out of this backpack this trusty CLAXXTON heavy machine gun. Then he touched this masters shoulder and he disappeared from view. They were about to overwhelm him but he simply shoot in a spin, the bullets completely destroyed this enemies. They tried to fire back but nothing fazed him, the outer god started to run through the mass of people with this harmonic knife, the sound of electric guitar feedback coming from the sharp instrument.\"Where I am?\" he asked himself just to see around him and noticed \"oh I am outside of that damn town, thank gods hahaha…Jesus this mission of mine was a fiasco\" he noticed that something was purring in the back of this head, and then he felt like something was ripping this neck, he falls to the ground in pain, realizing that he has now difficulty to breathe. Meanwhile this servant was having fun slaughtering every single mutated deep one he saw, \"why you keep head-buttin your own species, why?\" he though while using a head with a vertebral spine from a corpse as a bat around heavily injured deep ones, one of them appears behind him, climbs to this back and stabs this eye with a wood pencil, \"hey imbecile, I am already blind\" as he said this in a deadpan way he throws him to the ground and squashed this face with a stomp. As he fights this way he summons two moon beasts to cause mayhem around the city. He quickly regenerates this eye and begins to grab a small house, and then throws it to a crowd of three that had shotguns and pitchforks, the moons beasts were destroying every building they saw, but suddenly they saw a figure running out of their way, the second moon beast grabbed it and prepared to take a bit of this head, \"WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?!\" they heard this dreadful master, hearing him like that means a painful death. He stopped this act of eating this unlucky victim. \"Listen you tentacle face, this is a HUMAN, we dont kill those except when they oppose us! So put. Him. In. the. Ground. Slowly\" he complied, \"in fact rescue all the humans you can and put them in a save area. If I see blood of Homo sapiens in you (points to him this harmonic knife) I will grab your intestines and shove them up your eyes\" he then used this heat vision to cut some of the confused mutants, the moon beast grabbed the human and ran to the outskirts of the city. Suddenly in the shore, two giants were approaching the devastated ground with enraged faces.\"OH YEAH!\" Azathoth yelled when he saw those two figures \"how dare you to kill our brothers and daughter?! You have the audacity to attack us unprovoked!\" the male giant roared in an alien language that only gods can understand. \"Kill him my loved! He is insulting our right to use these humans as we please!\" the female one said, \"Hydra, Dagon. Even I though you werent this stupid, but hey easier for me\" he jumped to a high that rivaled the two elder fishes, and then he kicked Dagon in the face; this wife on the other hand was fighting the two dream lands beasts. \"come on, try to ask who I am, why I am doing this, come on, you know you want to oversized cat food!\" the small cylinder said as he started to shot the eyes of this enemy from this hand (he was being grabbed by dagon) \"YOU INSOLENT\" he was interrupted when a knife came to this other eye. He noticed that the wife of Dagon was wiping the floor with one moon beast, literally. \"Aw hell no! I am the only one that can do that!\" he said as the knife came back to him and he without a problem cut the arm of this bigger enemy\" when he landed he started to run at a speed that was unbelievable, he practically made this way through hydras legs! She felt to the ground and the surviving beast grabbed the fallen monster and started to eat this face.

{"id": "EN086", "pair": ["The Inn stands at the end of our largest thoroughfare, which is a few blocks long, but seems a thousand miles. With my heavy valise, Im fortunate that I only have to walk half that far from the restaurant at which Ive just dined. Once every month, I scrounge up enough money to have dinner at the Golden Goose. Despite my reputation in this village, I eventually come to long for the clamor of a crowd. The four walls of my fathers house are my sanctuary and prison otherwise. Only Theodora, our cook and housekeeper that weve had since before I was born, keeps me company there. I would take her with me on my monthly outings to Leights sole restaurant, but she stubbornly says she prefers her own meals all the same.Thats only part of the reason why she wont go, however. Ive told her that even at the Golden Goose, the diners there glare at me out of the corners of their eyes and lower them to their plates if I look their way. Theodora is an even more self-contained soul than I am, and loathes being stared at \"by all and sundry\".The evening sun is sinking low on the horizon, and the villagers around me are concealed in shadows. I dont want anyone coming up and asking me about my three-night errand - not that they would. When I prove the rumors about my forefathers establishment wrong, Ill make them all look like fools anyway!Those unfamiliar with Leight will notice three ever-present things as they travel down its main street: stalwart people, churches, and Cemetery Hill looming in the distance. Ever since I was a child, I sensed an eerie connection among these features of our humble village. Just what that is, I cannot say. They are ordinary enough on the surface, and yet I cant help feeling that theres something sinister about them.My neighbors are proud, hard-working souls. Most of them live on farms on the outskirts of town. Even so, they trudge nearly every day to its center in order to seek supplies. The men of Leight are burly, with long arms and sunburnt faces, trusting in their toil and suspicious of learnt folk. Its just as well that theyre illiterate. They wouldnt have much use for books even if they had the coin to buy them. Their wives, far from being what some people would call ladies, are just as industrious and sturdy as their husbands. I see them more often in town, as buying sundries is womens work, but that doesnt mean theyre any more inclined to talk to me. They keep to themselves, as I do, but it seems their hearts are under lock and key.I suspect that a large part of this has to do with the fact that they fear God as much as my familys past. Out of every ten buildings in Leight, at least four are churches. The Baptists, Catholics, Episcopalians, Evangelicals, Lutherans, Methodists, and even more denominations are continually at war. They each claim to believe in the Scriptures, and in the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. However, they also claim that all the others are false, to a greater or lesser degree. As for me? I attend no house of worship, and that is no great loss to me. My father, Lemuel Dawson, said that his own chapel - the one on Cemetery Hill - had been abruptly shuttered one Halloween night. His fellow congregants then fled to other nearby towns.\"My dear Millie,\" he had told me, \"the one true church on this Earth has been lost, and a year too early.\" Thats another thing Ive failed to understand, even though it haunts me as much as the Inn itself does.Hurrying to get there, I pass the people and churches without much concern. Only the visage of the former Gallows Hill, now containing graves instead of a gibbet, catches my eye. Buried there are not only the fifty-three souls who were hanged during the Purge (or so we called our witchcraft panic), but criminals and paupers. Ive often wondered why having no money is considered as great a crime as sorcery or theft, but in this village, if youre poor, then you are cursed. \"God helps those who help themselves\": so say we. I cannot help myself as I find my feet sprinting rather than walking toward the façade of the Dreamers Inn.The sky, now a cool blue-violet twilight, is growing dark. Ill soon leave light (and Leight?) behind. Even though Ive been inside the Dreamers Inn countless times, Ive always been a bit scared of the place. Why is it that, even though its supposed to be a haven for travelers, it seems like a mausoleum instead? I know that once I venture beyond its door, beneath the rickety sign that has announced its presence since the days of Abner Dawes, Ill be in a world unto itself. As such, I pause on the threshold and gaze up at its intimidating turret. Should I turn back and forget about spending a single night there, let alone three?Then I remember my reasons, both monetary and otherwise, and step inside.", "Long ago there were only the Elders. They lived enternaly as equals amongst each other in the ever expanding vastness of space. They looked at this empty universe and decided to fill it. But none of them would follow another for that would mean they would be intherior to another, so they decided that they would make lesser beings to craft this universe.These creatures were given a small portion of the Elders power, and made heinous looking so that they can never be considered equals in anyway. These beings did as what they were made for and filled the universe with planets and stars, but something happend to them, they started to question why they had to be lesser then their masters these beings that made them, their Gods. So they learned new powers and went to war with their creators. They were many but young and weak compared to their Elders.The war was over as quickly as it began. The lesser beings lost to their Elders and were severely punished for their actions against them. The weakest were imprisoned on the planet that they thrived on for so long, Earth. The mightiest were cast across the universe and separated from each other. The one who lead the rebel, Azathoth, was stripped of his own brain by the Lord Commander of the Elders and sealed in the center of the universe.He now thrives in an undying anger with only one thought in his mind, or at least whats left of his mind, the thought was Kill the Elders repeating in his head nonstop. His own kind had to sooth his seething anger to protect their own exsistence, for if he went mad even for a second it would mean the end of the everything even them. He is only stopped by the demonic flute playing of his kin. But while he goes mad, his children continue his work, waiting for the day they can be free and face the Elders once more in battle at their most darkest of hours.Somewhere in the space between Space and Time, two figures sat together. One named Nyarlathotep, dressed in his Pharaoh guise and picking at his nails. Another Yog-Sothoth, appearing as his usual slithering mass of tentacles with an orb shaped object at the center of it all. Yog looked over at Nyarlathotep in annoyance.\"Could you not do that here?\" He asked him angrily.\"Not do what? Pick my nails?\" Nyarlathotep lashed back at him.\"Is that what you call them? You do remember that they belong to those lesser beings, right?\"\"The humans? Oh they are not all that bad. I like to play with them.\"\"You only like the sound they make when they breake.\"\"Can you blame me? I have all this power and nothing to do. No equal, or rival...\" Nyarlathotep told Yog.\"What of Cthugha?\" Yog asked him.\"Hes no fun, takes everything so seriously.\"\"In his defense, you did take his sanity.\"\"Whatever.\" Nyarlathotep said put out by Yogs comment and returned to picking his nails.\"I asked you to stop that, now Im telling you to stop.\" Yog grew impatient.\"You wont give me any work. You wont let me pick my nails. What exactly am I supposed to do?\" Nyarlathotep asked him equally annoyed.\"Live and die. What else are you supposed to do?\"\"And what do I do while I live? It gets very dull to be enternal and have little to do, even in the infinite universe.\"\"We could talk, that should kill a couple eons.\" Yog suggested.\"That could work. Whats there to talk about?\" Nyarlathotep said interested in what Yog had to say.\"Well you seem to be so interested in these humans, what have they done that sets them apart from the rest of the universe?\"\"Ah where to begin? Have ya heard of what happend to Glaakis spawn?\"\"Thog? Yes, I have.\"\"Barbaric Cimmerians. Never under estimate the predecessors of the Celts.\" Nyarlathotep said to Yog. A moment of silence fell upon the duo as they tried to think of something that would interest the other while at the same time being new information to the other.\"...\" none had an idea of what to talk about. How does one speak of something an all seeing entity doesnt already know? The two grew uncomfortable with nothing to say to each other, then finally something they didnt expect to happen happend.\"Did you feel that?\" Yog asked Nyarlathotep.\"Not as well as you did, but yes nonetheless. Yog its time, awaken the others Ill get father.\" Nyarlathotep said with a grin on his face. Yog began to use all his mental power to awaken his own kind.All across the universe the Old Ones awoke. From the depths of the ocean to the furthest edge of the universe, they began to stir. An legion of abominations spread across the universe rose from their deathly slumber and migrated to one place in the univers, the center. Nyarlathotep went to control the last of them, their master and his father, Azathoth. He waited in the center of the universe soothed by the flute music.\"Good work fellows, Ill take it from here.\" Nyarlathotep told the flute players. He received scowls from his peers but did not care or even pay them any attention. He approached his father, a mass of tentecels with a strange aurora surrounding them and holding them together.\"Azathoth.\" Nyalrthotep spoke to him, getting his attention.\"Its time for you to get what you want must in the universe. Its time to kill the Elders.\" Azathoth began to stir. He grew restless and angry. The flute music kept his attention on Nyarlathotep allowing him to control his father.\"Follow me and youll have what you want.\" Nyarlathotep promised his father. What ever bit of sanity Azathoth had left allowed him to follow his son. All the pieces were falling into place for the final war to be waged.The Elders readied for war. They gathered in their Cathedral and spoke to another.\"Nodens has fallen into his slumber, the Old Ones are free once more.\" one of the Elders spoke.\"We will waste them as we have done before. There is no reason for this battle to go any different.\" another one answered him.\"We have grown old, they did not age and are now well rested.\"\"We have our experience.\"\"We need the youth to fight. Other wise we are mearly the few and the old versus the many and the young.\" The Elders paused for a moment and came to a realization.\"If we must commence the Ragnorak then we will. Lets just hope it does not come to that.\"Yog-Sothoth and Nyarlathotep regrouped along with the rest of their kind. Azathoth was controlled by his flutist for the time they needed him controlled. Nyarlathotep looked around trying to find something or someone.\"What are you doing now?\" Yog questioned him.\"Cthuga. Hes the last thing I need to meet on this battle field.\" Nyarlathotep said to Yog.\"Ah yes, of all the beings in the universe and you had to become arch nemesis to your own kind.\"\"Ive become everyones arch nemesis at one time or another. Minus you and father.\"\"Yes, you only have the guts to antagonize those lesser then you.\"\"Or equal. My philosophy is to never get in a fight that youll lose.\"\"Good philosophy.\"\"It has done me good for this long. Ah here are our opponents for the day.\" the duo looked and saw the Elders arrive. Despite their old age they were still fit warriors. If Azathoth could only see through his blind eye, no telling his reaction.\"Shall we?\" Yog asked Nyarlathotep.\"Oh I insist you give the order. Odds are the others will like it better if you do.\" Nyarlathotep answered him.\"Very well. Halt the flute playing!\" Yog ordered. Azathoth became angered. He started to lash out and attack every thing he could grasp. The Old ones stood clear and followed behinde him as he attacked the Elders army. The Elders held their ground and delt great damage twoards Azathoth but not without suffering their casualties.It took only minutes to finish off Azathoth but now their numbers were only a handful of what they started with. The Old One had only lost Azathoth and the few flutist he destroyed himself early. Nyarlathotep and Yog looked at eachother.\"Marvelous, lets end this finally.\" Nyarlathotep joyously.The Old Ones began to attack the Elders. The Elders had no choice but to preform their ultimate final solution on their creations. The Elders would have to cause Ragnorak. The last few Elders began to glow with energy and intense heat that could be felt even on Earth. The Old Ones knew what was happening.\"Didnt think they had it in them. So human of them to do the unexpected.\" Nyarlathotep said with joy.\"Glad this fascinates you, were about to die.\" Yog told him.\"Not with the ace in the hole we have, you.\" Nyarlathotep looked at him.\"Just this once bend the laws of all of reality and save your kind, or just us Im fine with either.\" Nyarlathotep told him.\"Your brilliant!\" He yelled at Nyarlathotep.\"Of course I am.\" Nyarlathotep said smugly. The Elders began to erupt with pure power that obliterated them and was spreading across the universe. It all would of surely have been destroyed if, ironically enough, not for Yog-Sothoth and his Reality bending power. The universe survived but the Old Ones were nowhere to be found in the universe. Thats where we come back to Earth my fair reader."]}
{"id": "EN014", "pair": ["Day 1-I never would imagine such thing would happen, in this diary I will document my strange and disturbing events. Once I was a normal respected teacher at Miskatonic, and then a member of this \"great race\" appears and teleports me to this place…its just too surreal, this place is a gigantic library, whit knowledge of humanity and more…this large creature its just disgusting, I just never saw something like this, its just bizarre. The flowers are just biologically impossible, but they are there. I am a prisoner? This place is huge, the race its big! Like a small building, I just imagine how impossibly big an entire city would be…I am like a mouse in a skyscraper. I try my best to sleep…god have mercy upon me. I have difficulty knowing what is day and what is night…because there are not windows, I have a theory that this place is underground. A few minutes after wandering around, my captor opens the massive door, ah I have forgotten, this room is almost alone without objects of my size, the only thing here is a giant sized TV with a typewriter on it. What kind of technology these creatures possess? I see that the giant clicks these claws constantly…why? Its some sort of communication? Suddenly he throws to me a metal box with a button on top of it, \"what sort of thing is this, creature?\" I ask. The giant just clicks this right claw. Without any other option I push the small cylinder, and nothing noticeable happens. But then it makes a long series of clicks again and the box suddenly begins to…talk: \"hello Wilhelm. I am a Yithnian, and I want your help. I have seen with horror that a god will crash-land on earth in two weeks! He is trapped in a suit that will retrain this great and immeasurable power. I will travel in time to bring him to you so we can begin our project\" suddenly he disappeared in an after-image. The thing he said…it was unbelievable a god exists, and he wants my help.Day…2 (i suppose) I been alone in this blank room for 4 hours…and when I was taken it was 1:30. Ok that is not the point. In this room there some sort of big book shells that dwarf by a few inches the aliens. I have opened the door to reveal that I was right, if this would be a city of gigantic size I would be like a mouse. Thousands of skyscrapers roam the underground dome that sustains the cave. This is just massive. One of the tallest buildings on earth will be like an electric floor fan compared to these hulks. Its just frightening to try to hide from these monsters. I still dont get why my captor doesnt appear yet. The buildings are made from a metal that is am mesh of golden with gray, and almost every one of them is rectangular. Three minutes remain of this wait and I see that the yith creature has returned, with a strange being in this arm. Also a book of my size; the creature started to click and the machine started to speak: \"I ask forgiveness Wilhelm, the time machine broke and I needed to fix it. Here it is…the great lord of the Outer gods, the blind idiot entity that everyone fears: Azathoth! My luck, our luck could not be greater my friend! He was trapped in the technology of my people and Mi-Gos we can make him anything we want!\" after handing me the book I have a better look at the \"God\" before me. He had a suit with long limbs; this head was highly (and horrifyingly) similar to the shape of the tall Flatiron Building in New York, in this top there were two small triangles that made the illusion of horns or wolf like ears. Little red lines in both sides of the face, (I suppose eyes) the helmet also it was colored silver. I also notice that this body has a light brown straightjacket like appearance. This right and left hands have black gloves (I suppose) with slightly long conical golden claws half of the fingers. These feet and legs are even more bizarre: black to the knees with silver to the lateral malleolus. The feet are the most structurally insane: it looks like a golden flat spike. It appears that this creature is unconscious. The book has revealed me some clues: Azathoth he is the most powerful entity in our universe, also the creator of a creator of other gods! The yiths are the race of my captor. They want to use the knowledge of my race to their disposal, what one? I dare not to put it in this diary…it would make anyone insane. The creature \"spoken\" to my again about why I am here; \"I want to give to the Outer God a new chance, one to redeem him/itself to use it as a tool for good. I will train you in a place that I made where time is infinite, where you dont need to eat, you will not exhaust, where you will not age. There I will make you a super intelligent being, due to the fact that there is technology of my race you will need to learn it. And you will make Azathoth something more than human.\" After that a door on a wall suddenly appeared, the place inside of it was blank grey. I am surprised of what I will do…I will create something to fight the unknown evil of this world! We will make this monster my monster! The yith told me that the place where we will go is applied named: Infinitely Timed Room.Day 3- the I.T.R. was excellent as a place for learning. I reckon I was there for 200 months. But I am fine to say the least. I finally learned how to manipulate the suit. It was revealed to me that there is a cube that reduces size inside of the helmet. There is a computer inside of that cube that can be modified. If I do that I can change Azathoth into a thinking creature. Also I will make him learn how to change the suit into anything he wants. I get a closer look at the monster and I can assume that he is still unconscious, or he doesnt know how to move. Thanks to a machine I built inside the I.T.R. a metal glob that can change into any human or eldritch tool I call it the anytool. I can mentally command it and only me, I change it into a buzz saw that cuts the center of the helmet. I see with awe that there are two metal cubes inside it. The one on the right has a circular window I see with my own mortal eyes what is in there: the thumb–sized daemon sultan himself. He was shaped like a tridimensional ellipse, in this surface it was covered with something similar to eggs of a fish or an amphibian, they divided the creature into two tones: in the right there where white \"eggs\" and only 3 black ones, there were 4 spiked eggs and white five tubes that have mouths. In the left there are only black eggs and 3 spiked white ones, 2 big human like jaws were located in the far left. Behind it there where mangled tentacles and claws. I see all this thanks to the anytool that I shaped into a microscope.The boxes where lead colored and they were 7cm tall and 7cm breadth. The one that is located upside is the one that constrains him and these powers, there is a mirror in the floor of the cube, the downer cube creates an incredibly thin ray that points into the mirror of the upper cube (they are epilated into a vertical position) that ray is the one that maintains this concurrent size. I cut the cube where the visor is and I slowly modify it.Day 4-I finally finalized the modification, and I closed the helmet. I created a level system: Level 1 makes him use a small bit of this power, with strength capable of lifting 50 tons. Level 2 makes him capable of creating creatures of this own, and this strength are enough powerful to level 10 buildings, Level 3…this one makes him use a quarter of this real power, he is capable of destroying a world with energy based blasts. And this physical strength is unmeasurable. Also I programed the cube (that works like a brain for Azathoth) to only to obey me, but to follow orders of any successor or member of my family.After a few hours the former god awakens and these first words are understandable: \"where…I am, what I am?\" this voice is deep and stern. I shudder what this reaction will be when I tell him the truth. Thankfully I made the upper cube make the thump sized monster a fast learner. \"My name is Wilhelm Smift, your master. Your name is Azathoth.\" The knight like creature stares at me; \"yes…Thou art. But please answer me who am i?\" \"You were a powerful creature, a god. But technological creatures transferred you into a body that constrains your power. Thankfully I have modified it to have a mind that thinks, that talks, without me you would be a blind idiot, all powerful Imbecile! You were a leader of other gods but you never made to them any commands, you where mindless. Now in turn serve me Azathoth, I will make you a tool for justice!\" the creature bows before me, but then to my fear I hear a chilling laugh, \"Why are you laughing daemon sultan?\" he talks to me slowly \"I will become a tool for extermination, isnt it master? I will become a machine only made for killing…ISNT IT MASTER?!\" he suddenly approaches me, whit these arms wide open. \"YOU MADE ME SOMETHING BETTER THAN A MINDLESS FOOL!\" he screams to the ceiling. Then he lungs at me, I expected an attack but the demon instead…hugs me. \"I cant be more grateful\" I dont know what to say, my wishes were answered, but I dread to know why such creature is happy to comply with requests for killing.", "V.The following winter brought an event no less strange than Wilbur’s first trip outside the Dunwich region. Correspondence with the Widener Library at Harvard, the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, the British Museum, the University of Buenos Ayres, and the Library of Miskatonic University of Arkham had failed to get him the loan of a book he desperately wanted; so at length he set out in person, shabby, dirty, bearded, and uncouth of dialect, to consult the copy at Miskatonic, which was the nearest to him geographically. Almost eight feet tall, and carrying a cheap new valise from Osborn’s general store, this dark and goatish gargoyle appeared one day in Arkham in quest of the dreaded volume kept under lock and key at the college library—the hideous Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred in Olaus Wormius’ Latin version, as printed in Spain in the seventeenth century. He had never seen a city before, but had no thought save to find his way to the university grounds; where, indeed, he passed heedlessly by the great white-fanged watchdog that barked with unnatural fury and enmity, and tugged frantically at its stout chain.      Wilbur had with him the priceless but imperfect copy of Dr. Dee’s English version which his grandfather had bequeathed him, and upon receiving access to the Latin copy he at once began to collate the two texts with the aim of discovering a certain passage which would have come on the 751st page of his own defective volume. This much he could not civilly refrain from telling the librarian—the same erudite Henry Armitage (A.M. Miskatonic, Ph. D. Princeton, Litt. D. Johns Hopkins) who had once called at the farm, and who now politely plied him with questions. He was looking, he had to admit, for a kind of formula or incantation containing the frightful name Yog-Sothoth, and it puzzled him to find discrepancies, duplications, and ambiguities which made the matter of determination far from easy. As he copied the formula he finally chose, Dr. Armitage looked involuntarily over his shoulder at the open pages; the left-hand one of which, in the Latin version, contained such monstrous threats to the peace and sanity of the world.      “Nor is it to be thought,” ran the text as Armitage mentally translated it, “that man is either the oldest or the last of earth’s masters, or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone. The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not in the spaces we know, but between them, They walk serene and primal, undimensioned and to us unseen. Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where They have trod earth’s fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread. By Their smell can men sometimes know Them near, but of Their semblance can no man know, saving only in the features of those They have begotten on mankind; and of those are there many sorts, differing in likeness from man’s truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance which is Them. They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with Their voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness. They bend the forest and crush the city, yet may not forest or city behold the hand that smites. Kadath in the cold waste hath known Them, and what man knows Kadath? The ice desert of the South and the sunken isles of Ocean hold stones whereon Their seal is engraven, but who hath seen the deep frozen city or the sealed tower long garlanded with seaweed and barnacles? Great Cthulhu is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only dimly. Iä! Shub-Niggurath! As a foulness shall ye know Them. Their hand is at your throats, yet ye see Them not; and Their habitation is even one with your guarded threshold. Yog-Sothoth is the key to the gate, whereby the spheres meet. Man rules now where They ruled once; They shall soon rule where man rules now. After summer is winter, and after winter summer. They wait patient and potent, for here shall They reign again.”      Dr. Armitage, associating what he was reading with what he had heard of Dunwich and its brooding presences, and of Wilbur Whateley and his dim, hideous aura that stretched from a dubious birth to a cloud of probable matricide, felt a wave of fright as tangible as a draught of the tomb’s cold clamminess. The bent, goatish giant before him seemed like the spawn of another planet or dimension; like something only partly of mankind, and linked to black gulfs of essence and entity that stretch like titan phantasms beyond all spheres of force and matter, space and time. Presently Wilbur raised his head and began speaking in that strange, resonant fashion which hinted at sound-producing organs unlike the run of mankind’s.      “Mr. Armitage,” he said, “I calc’late I’ve got to take that book home. They’s things in it I’ve got to try under sarten conditions that I can’t git here, an’ it ’ud be a mortal sin to let a red-tape rule hold me up. Let me take it along, Sir, an’ I’ll swar they wun’t nobody know the difference. I dun’t need to tell ye I’ll take good keer of it. It wa’n’t me that put this Dee copy in the shape it is. . . .”      He stopped as he saw firm denial on the librarian’s face, and his own goatish features grew crafty. Armitage, half-ready to tell him he might make a copy of what parts he needed, thought suddenly of the possible consequences and checked himself. There was too much responsiblity in giving such a being the key to such blasphemous outer spheres. Whateley saw how things stood, and tried to answer lightly.      “Wal, all right, ef ye feel that way abaout it. Maybe Harvard wun’t be so fussy as yew be.” And without saying more he rose and strode out of the building, stooping at each doorway.      Armitage heard the savage yelping of the great watchdog, and studied Whateley’s gorilla-like lope as he crossed the bit of campus visible from the window. He thought of the wild tales he had heard, and recalled the old Sunday stories in the Advertiser; these things, and the lore he had picked up from Dunwich rustics and villagers during his one visit there. Unseen things not of earth—or at least not of tri-dimensional earth—rushed foetid and horrible through New England’s glens, and brooded obscenely on the mountain-tops. Of this he had long felt certain. Now he seemed to sense the close presence of some terrible part of the intruding horror, and to glimpse a hellish advance in the black dominion of the ancient and once passive nightmare. He locked away the Necronomicon with a shudder of disgust, but the room still reeked with an unholy and unidentifiable stench. “As a foulness shall ye know them,” he quoted. Yes—the odour was the same as that which had sickened him at the Whateley farmhouse less than three years before. He thought of Wilbur, goatish and ominous, once again, and laughed mockingly at the village rumours of his parentage.      “Inbreeding?” Armitage muttered half-aloud to himself. “Great God, what simpletons! Shew them Arthur Machen’s Great God Pan and they’ll think it a common Dunwich scandal! But what thing—what cursed shapeless influence on or off this three-dimensioned earth—was Wilbur Whateley’s father? Born on Candlemas—nine months after May-Eve of 1912, when the talk about the queer earth noises reached clear to Arkham— What walked on the mountains that May-Night? What Roodmas horror fastened itself on the world in half-human flesh and blood?”      During the ensuing weeks Dr. Armitage set about to collect all possible data on Wilbur Whateley and the formless presences around Dunwich. He got in communication with Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury, who had attended Old Whateley in his last illness, and found much to ponder over in the grandfather’s last words as quoted by the physician. A visit to Dunwich Village failed to bring out much that was new; but a close survey of the Necronomicon, in those parts which Wilbur had sought so avidly, seemed to supply new and terrible clues to the nature, methods, and desires of the strange evil so vaguely threatening this planet. Talks with several students of archaic lore in Boston, and letters to many others elsewhere, gave him a growing amazement which passed slowly through varied degrees of alarm to a state of really acute spiritual fear. As the summer drew on he felt dimly that something ought to be done about the lurking terrors of the upper Miskatonic valley, and about the monstrous being known to the human world as Wilbur Whateley."]}
{"id": "EN041", "pair": ["Heavens not enoughIf when Im there I dont remember you...The words came unbidden to Torren-Wraeths mind. The line was from an old song from the soundtrack of an old Japanese anime that had confused and depressed the hell out of him. He shook his head, Heavens Not Enough, Steve Conte, Wolfs Rain soundtrack, No... there had been two soundtracks for that series, this was the first song on the second. Why wasnt it called Wolves Rain? He thought, trying to dispel the sad song, but it played on, and he was even singing softly toward the songs end...Cause I couldnt cryCause I turned awayCouldnt see the scoreDidnt know the painOf leaving yesterday really far behindin another lifein another dreamBy a different namegave it all away for a memory and a quiet lieand I felt the face Of the cold tonightStill dont know the scoreBut I know the painOf leaving everything really far behind ...Thus distracted, he did not see Dahlman.The sorcerer was a servant of the He Who Gnaws in The Darkness. Azathoth was neither ally nor enemy to Cthulhu, he was actually his Great-Grandfather having sired both Yog-Sothoth and Shub-Niggurath, who had sired Nug and Yeb, Nug being Cthulhus parent by parthogenesis. Azathoths worshipers, however, tended to be madmen in the truest sense. He was a mindless entity, neither desiring nor rewarding worship. Some of the gods who danced round and round his throne often took it upon themselves to accept his worship and grant gifts in his behalf. Especially Nyarlathotep...The Outer Gods were the key. Humans were a weak species, helpless in the face of even the least of The Great Old Ones. But by learning, by studying the Outer Gods, by utilizing their power, a human could assume a form of divinity themselves. For decades Dahlman had faithfully studied the ancient texts, The Book of Eibon, The Necronomicon, The Book of Iod, and he had learned to harness the power of those who lurked mindless and blind beyond the thin veil of reality. And now he would prove his worth, he would bring down an immortal, the child of a god...A bolt of lightning shook Torren-Wraeth from his revery, it barely hurt, but he could tell it was not natural. He turned to see a black-clad figuring closing in upon him, and erected a Deflect Harm even as the human struck out with Fist of Yog-Sothoth. \"Okay, now youre annoying me.\" Torren-Wraeth lashed out with Implant Fear, hoping to avoid having to actually kill this irrational attacker. He disliked sorcerers, but he also disliked having to harm people. But the madman had cast Deflect Harm upon himself, and, thus protected, struck back with The Dread Curse of Azathoth. Torren-Wraeth reeled, Now that hurt! Enraged, Torren-Wraeth physically rushed the sorcerer, ignoring the protective amulet the man held out, and punched him square in the nose, breaking it. Distracted by the pain, Dahlman fell before Implant Fear.Dahlmans mind was instantly overwhelmed with unimaginable fear and he turned to flee, all spells forgotten in his terror, only to run into a golden monstrosity streaking toward him in the dawning sky. He called frantically upon his gods to save him. But these were not benevolent gods, they were fickle, and enjoyed granting lesser beings great power, just to have the pleasure of snatching it away. His gods deserted him mid-flight, his skin shriveled and shrank tight against his bones as he aged in seconds. The capricious Outer Gods no doubt laughed as their former ward fell into the sea, and was immediately set upon by sharks.Torren-Wraeth and Tek watched impassively as the dying sorcerer fell into the sea.\"Who was that?\"\"I have no idea.\"\"And I thought you were in trouble.\"\"Sorry.\"\"You do get in the strangest situations.\" Tek observed wryly.\"Sorry.\"Youve made me late, you know.\"\"Sorry about that.\"\"Its okay, I could use the break. A word of advice, never marry a woman with five mouths.\"Both Tek and Torren-Wraeth laughed.Ho Fong arched an eyebrow as he saw the disheveled Torren-Wraeth accompanying Lord Tektaktequataquarl. Hed seen him before, of course, he occasionally visited alongside Tek, though his distaste for the ritual sacrifices of human beings was clearly evident. Fortunately, no such events were scheduled. \"Are you alright, Lord Torren-Wraeth?\" He knew better than to call him simply Torren or Wraeth. \"Ill be all right, Master Ho,\" Torren-Wraeth said with perfect Chinese courtesy, \"But I would be most grateful for a place to rest for a while.\" Ho Fong smiled, \"Of course,\" he turned, \"Ping, take lord Torren-Wraeth to one of the guest areas and provide him with whatever refreshments he requires.\" A youngish monk, dressed in the standard yellow and black silk, stepped forward and led Torren-Wraeth deeper into the monastery.It was instantly obvious to Torren-Wraeth that Ping was not Chinese, at least, not in the ethnic sense. He was one of the dreaded Tcho-Tcho people, descendants of toad-like creatures created by the Great Old One Chaugnar Faugn and human cultists. The Tcho-Tcho had an evil reputation, one well earned. The vast majority of them served the Great Old Ones, and many practiced cannibalism. There were exceptions, of course, not all Tcho-Tcho were evil or insane, but those individuals were usually outcasts, hated and sometimes even hunted by their own people. As they walked, Torren-Wraeth halted for a moment before an idol of carved black stone. It was well-crafted and incredibly detailed, lean muscled and lanky, wings extended, the webbed hands held palm up like a divine supplicant, the curving trunk-mouth lifted upward as if it were sounding a call. A call to Death itself, for this was Shugoran, The Herald of Death, worshiped and feared by the Tcho-Tcho people. Ping knelt reverently then hurried Torren-Wraeth into a nearby chamber.The scent of Black Lotus was thick in the air as the monks shut the great copper door behind Tek. \"You really shouldnt smoke you know,\" he said casually, \"Terrible for the lungs...\" The Bloated Woman rose from her cushions, \"Only if you are a mortal, which I am not.\" Tek smiled, then shed his semblance of humanity, becoming a writhing, shapeless mass of golden flesh, golden tentacles, golden eyes and pearly white fangs. \"What of our child?\" Several mouths spoke at once. The Goddess came closer with a grace unfitting such an obese creature. \"Nothing can harm our offspring.\" \"How long, do you think?\" The Bloated Woman stopped, apparently this visit was for business, not pleasure. \"It is impossible to tell. I have born some children within days of conception, and others within centuries.\" She sensed a slight jealous possessiveness on the part of the Hastur-Spawn, he wanted her as his sole mate, an amusing and archaic notion, not often seen in a True-Blood. The fact that he knew she had devoured most of the former lovers did not apparently assuage this unseemly feeling. \"I feel that this one will be born within a month or two...\" She grinned horribly with all five mouths, \"How has your father reacted?\" \"Our child will be welcome in Carcosa.\" Hastur, in truth, was somewhat worried, fearing that the child would be another avatar of Nyarlathotep, that the Crawling Chaos would use the child as yet another form in which to manifest itself. In other words, he feared that Nyarlathotep would give birth to itself...For all the vile practices that went on in the Monastery of The Bloated Woman, it was a beautiful place, richly decorated in jade and silver, gold and silk. Yellow and black, every strand of silk in the monastery was either yellow or black. The yellow made for a much friendlier environment than the dark, ominous stones of RLyeh. The Goddess favored those colors, for some reason. Torren-Wraeth remembered something Goro had once said. Among his people and several other Asian cultures, yellow was the color of mourning. Black meant death and mourning in the West, yellow filled that role in the East. Was it intentional? Probably, but he was a guest, and it would be rude to question his hosts. He changed from his slightly charred clothing into the yellow and black robes that had been kindly provided him and stepped out into the hallway. There he saw Ping once again kneeling before Shugoran.", "A smile lit Goros dark face. He looked down at the elegant dark blue kimono in his arms. \"Its beautiful.\" Torren-Wraeth smiled in return, he loved to see Goro smile. \"It belongs to you, Goro-chan.\" \"But, this is too...\" \"You deserve it far more than any pampered noble.\" The dark-skinned youth blushed. \"Thank you, Torren-kun!\" As Goro dressed, Torren-Wraeth looked at his own kimono, bright red and fashionable. He had worried about attracting undue attention with the appearance of wealth, but he decided that he was strong enough to risk any human robber or thief. Besides, this was to be their first trip to the Kabuki theater. It had taken enough time and effort to make himself appear human, he might as well show off. He looked up at Goro, partly dressed and excitedly pulling himself together. He thought of the men who had abused him, and felt a twitch of rage... Goro must never find out what Torren-Wraeth had done to those men. He did not want Goro to ever even hear the name YGolonac, much less learn what he was, how he dealt with his victims. Torren-Wraeth loathed YGolonac, the Defiler, the Obscenity, the obese, headless god of depravity, who devoured his victims slowly with the mouths in the palms of his flabby, groping hands. But he had to avenge Goro, he had to make them pay for using him, for torturing him, for robbing him of his childhood and his innocence. Only YGolonac could grant the punishment those men deserved... Then Goro was standing there, smiling, in his blue kimono, and Torren-Wraeth was happy again...Torren-Wraeth awoke slowly, not wanting to leave his dream, because Goro still lived in his dreams... He was in China, not Japan, in the Monastery of The Order of The Bloated Woman. Japan was gone, Goro was gone, and Torren-Wraeth was still here. Warm tears ran down his cheeks, but he brushed them away. Life had to go on, and on, and on...Great Cthulhu was concerned. Hastur seemed to have gained some favor in Nyarlathoteps many eyes, and anything that benefited Hastur weakened Cthulhu, in both their eyes. \"My Lord Cthulhu, there is no need for concern,\" The tall, red-robed figure that stood at the side of Cthulhus throne moved forward respectfully, Chxixsas bone-white face seemed to swim within his voluminous robes, \"It is well known that the fruits of Nyarlathoteps attentions are rarely to be desired.\" The voice was thin, hollow, distant, \" This may prove, in fact, a setback for The King in Tatters. Even now he trembles in his palace at Carcosa, fearing what manner of spawn this union may unleash.\" Cthulhu gave the equivalent of a laugh, \"Can you picture them, The Black Wind knocking down the walls of Carcosa, the Bloody Tongue crushing that cursed palace into dust! Oh, one can dream, Chxixsas... One can dream...\"The two masks, the Golden Angel and the Slender Maiden stood side by side, Isnt it all a lie, in the end? Torren-Wraeth bowed politely before the Bloated Woman. She was holding the Black Fan under her eyes, giving the illusion that she was a slender young lady, at least to the humans present. Ho Fong stood by reverently, but his jealousy of Tek was as strong as ever. Torren-Wraeth wondered if The Bloated Woman would play them against each other...He hoped not, for both their sakes. \"It is an honor to again have the presence of the Son of Cthulhu in my humble monastery.\" \"The honor is all mine,\" Torren-Wraeth replied softly, \"My father sends his greetings and good-will toward you, My Lady.\" The Bloated Womans nose-tendril curled delicately in the air, \"No doubt. Send him my good-will in return.\" Torren-Wraeth couldnt help but look at the sacrificial altar, where human victims had their arms cut off by the sacred sickles, after which they bled to death. He shuddered slightly at the horrible images flashing through his mind. The Bloated Woman noted this, but politely made no mention of it. Torren-Wraeth honestly could not condemn her, almost all of the worshiped entities, including his own father, demanded human sacrifice, many in even more horrible ways... \"I regret that I have to leave so soon, though I am grateful for your hospitality.\" The last part, at least, was true. \"May The Key and The Gate be with you.\""]}

This is no mere dream; its a recollection, and thats exactly what I did back then. \"Im here as always, Father.\" \"Millie,\" he says weakly, and smiles through the pain of nearly-constant coughing. \"Come closer.\" I do, and wince at his fevered breath. \"Theres something that I must tell you, at long last.\" Every word of his is belabored. His voice reminds me of a desert wind, scorched with sand. Even his sickroom has that acrid air, as if we were in the middle of the Sahara instead of Massachusetts.

However, I dare not leave his chamber to fetch a wet cloth for fear of missing his last words.\"They have come for me, and…you must know all that I do before they come for you. Find the keys,\" he says before being consumed with another coughing fit, \"in the bottom drawer of my desk. Bring them here.\" Again I follow his directions, yet hesitantly. Throughout his life, Father had been very particular about who was allowed to touch his personal possessions, and rummage through his desks and cabinets. Even our taciturn Theodora, whod never reveal any of his secrets even under duress, was forbidden from doing so. Father gave explicit instructions on which rooms were to be cleaned (kitchen, parlor, and so on), and which were not (his spartan bedroom after Mother died, and private study).

Perhaps, now that hes facing his own hangman in the form of an illness that not even Leights doctor can diagnose, images of the Purge are haunting him. \"Read and learn all you can, when youre prepared. Take care.\" I couldnt stop myself: \"Why take care? Is something wrong? Who are they, Father? Please explain!\" \"It would take…too long.\" He slowly smiles, exposing all of his teeth in the white rictus of a deaths-head. Pressing the keys so firmly into my palm that they leave mild scrapes and indentations afterward, Father coughs once more. \"Believe.\" With that, his withered hand releases mine and falls to his side limply. He is no longer alive, and our conversation has drained me so much that I can do nothing but sob in fright.I wake up to find my pillow damp, and my eyes glistening. There is no one around save for me, and the all-encompassing darkness to hide my tears. Its been seventeen years, almost to the day, since Lemuel Dawson departed this mortal world. I feel ashamed of myself, because after nearly two decades, I should not be so stricken with grief. Father, at this point in time, should be a distant memory, a framed portrait on the wall of my house and mind. However, he is not. He has evidently remained with me, in a locked compartment of my mental faculties that only dreams can reopen. Why now? Why here, in this very Inn? If the keys that he gave me so long ago - and which Ive reconfined to the drawer from which I took them - are back in his old house, then why didnt I dream about them back there? This is too strange, and scary.When youre prepared, Father had told me, read and learn all you can. Prepared for what, I wonder?", "Some people who sleep at the Dreamers Inn, in my hometown of Leight, Massachusetts, never wake up.So it is said. Tis a wonder that our only boarding place for travelers manages to stay open at all, with the ceaseless grinding of the rumor mill reaching wayfarers ears before they reach here. Our villages moniker is pronounced as if the \"e\" were not there, nor any source of illumination. Despite our best efforts to redeem the name of Leight, it is still spoken like a curse. We are God-fearing folk now, in anno Domini 1893, but some of us werent two hundred years ago. The witchcraft panic that had hit Salem in 1692 infected us like a fever one year later. Fifty people were sickened, and cured by a visit to Gallows Hill.My great-great-grandfather and original proprietor of the Inn, Goodman Abner Dawes, was one of them.My name is Millicent Dawson. Even though Im four generations descended from him, respectable people in Leight cross to the other side of the street when they see me. If it werent for my late fathers pension, Id be searching these same streets for men too drunk to care about my ancestry. Im a spinster at thirty-four, but still pretty according to the Inns current owner. Not that Id have Monsieur Thènard! He is no drunkard, but sometimes I wish he were. His eyes, never bloodshot and always keen, are those of a wolf.Is it he that continues to lend the rumors such credence? Has he dared to murder his own customers?Pah! Its far more likely that the villagers, many of whom are superstitious illiterates, want to keep anyone from having anything to do with the Dreamers Inn because theyre terrified. I, for one, am not. I know my great-great-grandfathers establishment for what it is: a broken-down lodging house, greatly refurbished, with three floors and servants quarters at the top. Its the closest thing that Leight has to a castle, because the guest rooms and garret are contained within a tall turret. The Inn is the very sort that inspires ghosts and unspeakable phantoms to possess ones imagination - even mine. I suppose I cannot blame my naïve neighbors too much. If Im out in the evening, having a bite of dinner at our only restaurant, I try not to gaze up at that tower. As it darkens in the fading twilight, it slowly turns blacker than any sort of pitch.What is it about the place that makes me shudder, even though Im not so silly as to believe its haunted?How has it remained a dreamers refuge for more than two centuries, my ancestors toil notwithstanding?Why do I always see it in my own dreams, as it draws me like iron toward a magnet?Such mysteries are better left unsolved. What I must do is remain calm, and grounded in practicalities.The rumors state that no visitor to the Dreamers Inn has ever been a guest for more than one night. Even those travelers who have spent that brief length of time within its walls have departed without a word, in a mad frenzy of escape. Ive lived in Leight all my life, and have no reason to pay for a room when Im safe enough in my late fathers house. Nevertheless, I intend to stay not for one night, but three. I shall prove the chatter of my fellow citizens to be foolish gossip, once and for all, and bring more business to the Inn. I receive a share of its profits, being the only living descendant of its owners throughout the generations.Fathers pension is barely holding out, and with a bitter chill in the air, I need some more money for winter."]}

This is too strange, and scary.When youre prepared, Father had told me, read and learn all you can. Prepared for what, I wonder?", "\"You fool, Warren is DEAD!\"As soon as the demonic and bestial voice had finished its horrifying utterance, my fear, which had spent the last several minutes of my final, despairing conversation with Warren in a state of suspended animation waiting in vain to hear of my friends hopeful escape, spread from my chest to my head and from there, spread like a cold sensation through my veins, filling me with a terrified despairing sensation that I had never experienced before. I was paralyzed by my fear. My legs gave out, and I collapsed on the floor of the tomb. Suddenly the blackness closed in, and I knew no more.I woke up the next day to the muted yet familiar smell of sterilized linens. After my disorientation dissipated, I realized that I had been taken to the local hospital. From Warrens research into the entrance to the netherworld, we had discovered that the areas surrounding the entrances were feared by local peoples, and were feared and avoided.A mild sense of comfort filled me as I realized that whatever entity had taken my friend from this mortal realm had not escaped its netherworld lair. Its words haunted my thoughts, resonating in my mind like a bell. Shortly after my awakening, a nurse entered my room to tell me that the sheriff had asked for me.Soon after, a stout, short man entered the room. He had a worried look on his face. I could tell that whatever he wanted to discuss with me was done with great reluctance and anxiety. He stuttered through a short introduction, his name being Alan Graham. He had said he had found me after he had received reports from some of the local people near the graveyard, that two grave robbers had been trespassing onto the forbidden lands. He had found me unconscious in the tomb, but had not seen or heard anything. He was obviously spooked by the dilapidated structures in the swamp and had taken me to the hospital. He asked me of what happened to the man that witnesses saw me enter the swamp with.I was filled with an inhumane dread at the thought of telling the oblivious detective of my experience in the graveyard. However, I braved through my fear, though had to take several pauses to avoid becoming overcome with fear and passing out again. By the time, I had finished, Graham had begun sobbing uncontrollably, He had started shaking as big, wet tears dropped down his face. Though I dont understand why, he had believed my tale. Graham told me that I could leave, as long as I didnt go back to the graveyard. I agreed, heaving no desire to return the horror that had taken Warren from this life.The next four months of my life were haunted by nightmares of the disembodied voice talking to me through the grave. Though I attempted to forget that night, my mind would always take me back to the graveyard. While my mind was filled with immense terror of what I had observed, I was so curious as to what Warren had unearthed in that hidden necropolis. The thoughts of the latter slowly consumed my thoughts, and I was unable to function in society. I was resolved to find out what Warren had unearthed. However, I was aware of the danger I faced, and decided I would go back by myself. If I died, I would take the knowledge of the location of the portal to the underworld with me.I returned the following autumn, having read up on the lore that Warren had kept hidden me, from my own protection. The tomes he had uncovered told tales of the monstrous demons that could travel between the underworld and the surface one. The tomes were mostly undecipherable to me, as my linguistic ability was not strong enough to decipher the archaic texts. However, I was able to make out the basic information, though none of the stories told me of a way to prevent being killed or how to hide myself from the undead beings.Despite the bleakness of my remaining mortality, my curiosity of the hidden world that only a few mortals had ever seen grew stronger and stronger, dominating my thoughts. I knew I had to return, even though I would likely die.When I returned to the cemetery, I was unsurprised that everything had remained completely the same. The equipment Warren and I had brought had remained untouched, the telephone wire still being in place. My mind quickly focused on Warren, would I discover his remains, if the demons had even left his body? I removed the black slab covering the entrance, though it too much longer than when I had Warren helping me. Nevertheless, I was able to move the stone. However, I was only able to budge it so that it would eventually close on the doorway, trapping me inside.Though I knew my life would be lost, my curiosity had taken over me, and I knew that until I had seen what horrors or wonder were hidden beneath the tomb, I could not find peace. So, I set off into the darkness. These are the final thoughts I have before I leave this world. To whoever discovers this note next to this other worldly gateway, the horrors beneath this tomb have consumed my life, and for your sake, I pray that you do not become entrapped into its ethereal mystique as I have. Run, you fool, run, before you are trapped in spirit and in body as I am! Run, before the obsession takes over your every waking thought! Leave!- Randolph Carter"]}
{"id": "EN071", "pair": ["Day 1-I never would imagine such thing would happen, in this diary I will document my strange and disturbing events. Once I was a normal respected teacher at Miskatonic, and then a member of this \"great race\" appears and teleports me to this place…its just too surreal, this place is a gigantic library, whit knowledge of humanity and more…this large creature its just disgusting, I just never saw something like this, its just bizarre. The flowers are just biologically impossible, but they are there. I am a prisoner? This place is huge, the race its big! Like a small building, I just imagine how impossibly big an entire city would be…I am like a mouse in a skyscraper. I try my best to sleep…god have mercy upon me. I have difficulty knowing what is day and what is night…because there are not windows, I have a theory that this place is underground. A few minutes after wandering around, my captor opens the massive door, ah I have forgotten, this room is almost alone without objects of my size, the only thing here is a giant sized TV with a typewriter on it. What kind of technology these creatures possess? I see that the giant clicks these claws constantly…why? Its some sort of communication? Suddenly he throws to me a metal box with a button on top of it, \"what sort of thing is this, creature?\" I ask. The giant just clicks this right claw. Without any other option I push the small cylinder, and nothing noticeable happens. But then it makes a long series of clicks again and the box suddenly begins to…talk: \"hello Wilhelm. I am a Yithnian, and I want your help. I have seen with horror that a god will crash-land on earth in two weeks! He is trapped in a suit that will retrain this great and immeasurable power. I will travel in time to bring him to you so we can begin our project\" suddenly he disappeared in an after-image. The thing he said…it was unbelievable a god exists, and he wants my help.Day…2 (i suppose) I been alone in this blank room for 4 hours…and when I was taken it was 1:30. Ok that is not the point. In this room there some sort of big book shells that dwarf by a few inches the aliens. I have opened the door to reveal that I was right, if this would be a city of gigantic size I would be like a mouse. Thousands of skyscrapers roam the underground dome that sustains the cave. This is just massive. One of the tallest buildings on earth will be like an electric floor fan compared to these hulks. Its just frightening to try to hide from these monsters. I still dont get why my captor doesnt appear yet. The buildings are made from a metal that is am mesh of golden with gray, and almost every one of them is rectangular. Three minutes remain of this wait and I see that the yith creature has returned, with a strange being in this arm. Also a book of my size; the creature started to click and the machine started to speak: \"I ask forgiveness Wilhelm, the time machine broke and I needed to fix it. Here it is…the great lord of the Outer gods, the blind idiot entity that everyone fears: Azathoth! My luck, our luck could not be greater my friend! He was trapped in the technology of my people and Mi-Gos we can make him anything we want!\" after handing me the book I have a better look at the \"God\" before me. He had a suit with long limbs; this head was highly (and horrifyingly) similar to the shape of the tall Flatiron Building in New York, in this top there were two small triangles that made the illusion of horns or wolf like ears. Little red lines in both sides of the face, (I suppose eyes) the helmet also it was colored silver. I also notice that this body has a light brown straightjacket like appearance. This right and left hands have black gloves (I suppose) with slightly long conical golden claws half of the fingers. These feet and legs are even more bizarre: black to the knees with silver to the lateral malleolus. The feet are the most structurally insane: it looks like a golden flat spike. It appears that this creature is unconscious. The book has revealed me some clues: Azathoth he is the most powerful entity in our universe, also the creator of a creator of other gods! The yiths are the race of my captor. They want to use the knowledge of my race to their disposal, what one? I dare not to put it in this diary…it would make anyone insane. The creature \"spoken\" to my again about why I am here; \"I want to give to the Outer God a new chance, one to redeem him/itself to use it as a tool for good. I will train you in a place that I made where time is infinite, where you dont need to eat, you will not exhaust, where you will not age. There I will make you a super intelligent being, due to the fact that there is technology of my race you will need to learn it. And you will make Azathoth something more than human.\" After that a door on a wall suddenly appeared, the place inside of it was blank grey. I am surprised of what I will do…I will create something to fight the unknown evil of this world! We will make this monster my monster! The yith told me that the place where we will go is applied named: Infinitely Timed Room.Day 3- the I.T.R. was excellent as a place for learning. I reckon I was there for 200 months. But I am fine to say the least. I finally learned how to manipulate the suit. It was revealed to me that there is a cube that reduces size inside of the helmet. There is a computer inside of that cube that can be modified. If I do that I can change Azathoth into a thinking creature. Also I will make him learn how to change the suit into anything he wants. I get a closer look at the monster and I can assume that he is still unconscious, or he doesnt know how to move. Thanks to a machine I built inside the I.T.R. a metal glob that can change into any human or eldritch tool I call it the anytool. I can mentally command it and only me, I change it into a buzz saw that cuts the center of the helmet. I see with awe that there are two metal cubes inside it. The one on the right has a circular window I see with my own mortal eyes what is in there: the thumb–sized daemon sultan himself. He was shaped like a tridimensional ellipse, in this surface it was covered with something similar to eggs of a fish or an amphibian, they divided the creature into two tones: in the right there where white \"eggs\" and only 3 black ones, there were 4 spiked eggs and white five tubes that have mouths. In the left there are only black eggs and 3 spiked white ones, 2 big human like jaws were located in the far left. Behind it there where mangled tentacles and claws. I see all this thanks to the anytool that I shaped into a microscope.The boxes where lead colored and they were 7cm tall and 7cm breadth. The one that is located upside is the one that constrains him and these powers, there is a mirror in the floor of the cube, the downer cube creates an incredibly thin ray that points into the mirror of the upper cube (they are epilated into a vertical position) that ray is the one that maintains this concurrent size. I cut the cube where the visor is and I slowly modify it.Day 4-I finally finalized the modification, and I closed the helmet. I created a level system: Level 1 makes him use a small bit of this power, with strength capable of lifting 50 tons. Level 2 makes him capable of creating creatures of this own, and this strength are enough powerful to level 10 buildings, Level 3…this one makes him use a quarter of this real power, he is capable of destroying a world with energy based blasts. And this physical strength is unmeasurable. Also I programed the cube (that works like a brain for Azathoth) to only to obey me, but to follow orders of any successor or member of my family.After a few hours the former god awakens and these first words are understandable: \"where…I am, what I am?\" this voice is deep and stern. I shudder what this reaction will be when I tell him the truth. Thankfully I made the upper cube make the thump sized monster a fast learner. \"My name is Wilhelm Smift, your master. Your name is Azathoth.\" The knight like creature stares at me; \"yes…Thou art. But please answer me who am i?\" \"You were a powerful creature, a god. But technological creatures transferred you into a body that constrains your power. Thankfully I have modified it to have a mind that thinks, that talks, without me you would be a blind idiot, all powerful Imbecile! You were a leader of other gods but you never made to them any commands, you where mindless. Now in turn serve me Azathoth, I will make you a tool for justice!\" the creature bows before me, but then to my fear I hear a chilling laugh, \"Why are you laughing daemon sultan?\" he talks to me slowly \"I will become a tool for extermination, isnt it master? I will become a machine only made for killing…ISNT IT MASTER?!\" he suddenly approaches me, whit these arms wide open. \"YOU MADE ME SOMETHING BETTER THAN A MINDLESS FOOL!\" he screams to the ceiling. Then he lungs at me, I expected an attack but the demon instead…hugs me. \"I cant be more grateful\" I dont know what to say, my wishes were answered, but I dread to know why such creature is happy to comply with requests for killing.", "“Gorgons, and Hydras, and Chimaeras—dire stories of Celaeno and the Harpies—may reproduce themselves in the brain of superstition—but they were there before. They are transcripts, types—the archetypes are in us, and eternal. How else should the recital of that which we know in a waking sense to be false come to affect us at all? Is it that we naturally conceive terror from such objects, considered in their capacity of being able to inflict upon us bodily injury? O, least of all! These terrors are of older standing. They date beyond body—or without the body, they would have been the same. . . . That the kind of fear here treated is purely spiritual—that it is strong in proportion as it is objectless on earth, that it predominates in the period of our sinless infancy—are difficulties the solution of which might afford some probable insight into our ante-mundane condition, and a peep at least into the shadowland of pre-existence.”—Charles Lamb: “Witches and Other Night-Fears”I.When a traveller in north central Massachusetts takes the wrong fork at the junction of the Aylesbury pike just beyond Dean’s Corners he comes upon a lonely and curious country. The ground gets higher, and the brier-bordered stone walls press closer and closer against the ruts of the dusty, curving road. The trees of the frequent forest belts seem too large, and the wild weeds, brambles, and grasses attain a luxuriance not often found in settled regions. At the same time the planted fields appear singularly few and barren; while the sparsely scattered houses wear a surprisingly uniform aspect of age, squalor, and dilapidation. Without knowing why, one hesitates to ask directions from the gnarled, solitary figures spied now and then on crumbling doorsteps or on the sloping, rock-strown meadows. Those figures are so silent and furtive that one feels somehow confronted by forbidden things, with which it would be better to have nothing to do. When a rise in the road brings the mountains in view above the deep woods, the feeling of strange uneasiness is increased. The summits are too rounded and symmetrical to give a sense of comfort and naturalness, and sometimes the sky silhouettes with especial clearness the queer circles of tall stone pillars with which most of them are crowned.      Gorges and ravines of problematical depth intersect the way, and the crude wooden bridges always seem of dubious safety. When the road dips again there are stretches of marshland that one instinctively dislikes, and indeed almost fears at evening when unseen whippoorwills chatter and the fireflies come out in abnormal profusion to dance to the raucous, creepily insistent rhythms of stridently piping bull-frogs. The thin, shining line of the Miskatonic’s upper reaches has an oddly serpent-like suggestion as it winds close to the feet of the domed hills among which it rises.       As the hills draw nearer, one heeds their wooded sides more than their stone-crowned tops. Those sides loom up so darkly and precipitously that one wishes they would keep their distance, but there is no road by which to escape them. Across a covered bridge one sees a small village huddled between the stream and the vertical slope of Round Mountain, and wonders at the cluster of rotting gambrel roofs bespeaking an earlier architectural period than that of the neighbouring region. It is not reassuring to see, on a closer glance, that most of the houses are deserted and falling to ruin, and that the broken-steepled church now harbours the one slovenly mercantile establishment of the hamlet. One dreads to trust the tenebrous tunnel of the bridge, yet there is no way to avoid it. Once across, it is hard to prevent the impression of a faint, malign odour about the village street, as of the massed mould and decay of centuries. It is always a relief to get clear of the place, and to follow the narrow road around the base of the hills and across the level country beyond till it rejoins the Aylesbury pike. Afterward one sometimes learns that one has been through Dunwich.      Outsiders visit Dunwich as seldom as possible, and since a certain season of horror all the signboards pointing toward it have been taken down. The scenery, judged by any ordinary aesthetic canon, is more than commonly beautiful; yet there is no influx of artists or summer tourists. Two centuries ago, when talk of witch-blood, Satan-worship, and strange forest presences was not laughed at, it was the custom to give reasons for avoiding the locality. In our sensible age—since the Dunwich horror of 1928 was hushed up by those who had the town’s and the world’s welfare at heart—people shun it without knowing exactly why. Perhaps one reason—though it cannot apply to uninformed strangers—is that the natives are now repellently decadent, having gone far along that path of retrogression so common in many New England backwaters. They have come to form a race by themselves, with the well-defined mental and physical stigmata of degeneracy and inbreeding. The average of their intelligence is woefully low, whilst their annals reek of overt viciousness and of half-hidden murders, incests, and deeds of almost unnamable violence and perversity. The old gentry, representing the two or three armigerous families which came from Salem in 1692, have kept somewhat above the general level of decay; though many branches are sunk into the sordid populace so deeply that only their names remain as a key to the origin they disgrace. Some of the Whateleys and Bishops still send their eldest sons to Harvard and Miskatonic, though those sons seldom return to the mouldering gambrel roofs under which they and their ancestors were born.      No one, even those who have the facts concerning the recent horror, can say just what is the matter with Dunwich; though old legends speak of unhallowed rites and conclaves of the Indians, amidst which they called forbidden shapes of shadow out of the great rounded hills, and made wild orgiastic prayers that were answered by loud crackings and rumblings from the ground below. In 1747 the Reverend Abijah Hoadley, newly come to the Congregational Church at Dunwich Village, preached a memorable sermon on the close presence of Satan and his imps; in which he said:      “It must be allow’d, that these Blasphemies of an infernall Train of Daemons are Matters of too common Knowledge to be deny’d; the cursed Voices of Azazel and Buzrael, of Beelzebub and Belial, being heard now from under Ground by above a Score of credible Witnesses now living. I my self did not more than a Fortnight ago catch a very plain Discourse of evill Powers in the Hill behind my House; wherein there were a Rattling and Rolling, Groaning, Screeching, and Hissing, such as no Things of this Earth cou’d raise up, and which must needs have come from those Caves that only black Magick can discover, and only the Divell unlock.”      Mr. Hoadley disappeared soon after delivering this sermon; but the text, printed in Springfield, is still extant. Noises in the hills continued to be reported from year to year, and still form a puzzle to geologists and physiographers.      Other traditions tell of foul odours near the hill-crowning circles of stone pillars, and of rushing airy presences to be heard faintly at certain hours from stated points at the bottom of the great ravines; while still others try to explain the Devil’s Hop Yard—a bleak, blasted hillside where no tree, shrub, or grass-blade will grow. Then too, the natives are mortally afraid of the numerous whippoorwills which grow vocal on warm nights. It is vowed that the birds are psychopomps lying in wait for the souls of the dying, and that they time their eerie cries in unison with the sufferer’s struggling breath. If they can catch the fleeing soul when it leaves the body, they instantly flutter away chittering in daemoniac laughter; but if they fail, they subside gradually into a disappointed silence.      These tales, of course, are obsolete and ridiculous; because they come down from very old times. Dunwich is indeed ridiculously old—older by far than any of the communities within thirty miles of it. South of the village one may still spy the cellar walls and chimney of the ancient Bishop house, which was built before 1700; whilst the ruins of the mill at the falls, built in 1806, form the most modern piece of architecture to be seen. Industry did not flourish here, and the nineteenth-century factory movement proved short-lived. Oldest of all are the great rings of rough-hewn stone columns on the hill-tops, but these are more generally attributed to the Indians than to the settlers. Deposits of skulls and bones, found within these circles and around the sizeable table-like rock on Sentinel Hill, sustain the popular belief that such spots were once the burial-places of the Pocumtucks; even though many ethnologists, disregarding the absurd improbability of such a theory, persist in believing the remains Caucasian."]}
{"id": "EN025", "pair": ["Mantineus-Im more Mr. Briggs, than the I this time.Disclaimer-I own nothing!I\"Im gonna burn.\"Thats when I knew it got really bad. He was always a little nuts, but that. Saying it with an innocent smile and certainty. It sent chills up my spine and I experienced a fear I have not faced in my entire life.It was at this point that I realized that he really was beyond saving.How he got like this, god only knows. Before he was admitted to my sanitarium I checked his background. It was clean. His mother and father were decently sane, as were his grandparents and siblings. I checked hospital files and came up with nothing out of the ordinary. Colds, flu, and a few scrapes. Normal for any boy.Upon his arrival I waited in my office, glancing at the anniversary clock that adorned my desk religiously. Despite its bad memory, I couldnt stand to throw it away, so in my office it has stayed. Poor Lucinda.With annoyance, I watched as an orderly struggled to seat him in a chair. He was antsy and, from what I gathered, he felt he needed to be somewhere else.\"Hello,\" I said gently, hoping to direct his attention on me so that the orderly could strap him in the chair.For my protection as well as his. On the ride here he was without a straitjacket and chipped his nails and teeth trying to escape and then from trying to fatally tear his wrists open with the aforementioned parts. God only knew what he would try to do to me if I stepped out of his line.Finally, we were alone. He thrashed about for a minute before I began.\"Hello,\" I began. \"Im your new doctor.\"From there he stared at me with eyes of steel. It unnerved me; it was like he was looking through me and saw my soul. He kept staring and my psychologists nerve was faltering. Mentally I was panicking and I wondered if, due to his stoic stare, if he was looking deeper than my outer appearance of fear.My childhood flashed before my eyes.\"So doc,\" He began, his voice was gravely and deep. \"Whats your first question?\"This took me by surprise that I had to clear my throat, tap my papers back into place, and start again.\"Yes, well. You see, Ive checked your records, Mr.-\"\"Dont say it!\" He screamed, face twisting into pure, unimaginable fear. \"They might not know Im here!\"\"Whos they?\"His snapped. As if the fearful shell broke and revealed this manic, demented smile. It seemed sadistic and menacing, yet what he said was pure jibber-jabber.\"Them, doc!\" He said. His face changed again; he was stumped. \"You mean you dont know, doc? Surely youve encountered others like me.\"\"No,\" I agreed. \"Im afraid I havent.\"He began to laugh. It was long and insane. Yet, as abruptly as it began, it ended and he could have passed for a sane person within that silent second.\"Then give up this case, doc.\" He said, a chuckle escaping his throat. \"Give it to someone who knows!\"If only I listened.IIAs the sessions progressed, I admit to feeling a slight disheartenment. He would reveal nothing of his condition other than ramblings like before. Though, one day he did something of note.He was rocking back and forth in a big, exaggerated way. He would swing forward, mumble something then swing back and shout a made up word.For example, on his first forward rock he would mumble something akin to a sneeze then shout \"Fhtagn!\" Yog-soth \"Fhtagn!\" Oz-soth \"Fhtagn!\"He then began to say another strange word, of which I surmised were names, when he stopped. He got so far as \"Nya\" when he began to giggle like a lunatic and rock his torso rapidly while repeating that strange made up word.\"Fhtagn! Fhtagn! Fhtagn!\"\"Mr.-\"He began to scream as if in agony. From previous sessions, I knew it was most likely from my trying to utter his name. But, unlike previous times where he would instantly stop, he began to sob. His face flushed crimson, his eyes became slits from whence tears began to flow.\"The Necronomicon!\" He screamed, his sobs becoming more intense. \"De…Destroy….Destroy it!\"\"What?\"\"Destroy the Necronomicon!\" He shouted, he looked a mixture of agony and rage. \"Destroy it! Destroy that damn book!\"Five minutes after that outburst he stopped. Despite the still flushed face and teary eyes, he looked as if it never happened. And with that deep, gravelly voice he spoke.\"Destroy it doc.\" The intense glare he gave me sent me flashes of hellfire and promises of pain and horror the likes of which Ill never comprehend.\"Destroy it. Dont look at it, dont read it, and-whatever you do-Dont look at the back page!\"Two sessions after that he seemed to follow back into our usual routine. That is, until our third. It was then that he said what I knew was the truth. He was gone to the sane world. And despite our other methods, they would not be enough to bring him back.\"Im gonna burn.\" He said, then, with an exaggerated nod he began. \"Yep. Im gonna burn that damn book.\"\"And why would you burn it?\" I asked.He clammed up.Miskatonic University. I have been there, of course, as a student of psychology. Hoping to better myself in understanding the people around me; a curse of a recluse, Im afraid. Though I have never heard of such a book, my curiosity had gotten the better of me and I sent a letter to the Miskatonic Library.A few days later a package arrived for me with a note. The Librarian was slightly against me looking at it, but considering my profession, she allowed it. But I was to return it within a timely manner. I did not flip through it. I cannot explain why, but I felt a sense of doom upon glancing at the ancient tome.But, at least, I had something to talk about in our next session.III\"I have the book.\" I started.His eyes picked up. He smiled like a child at Christmas morning before unwrapping his gifts. He started to shake the chair he was chained to. Rapidly he asked questions like \"You didnt read it did you?\" and \"Did you burn it? If you did, can I see the ashes?\"\"No, I didnt read it.\" I confessed. \"Nor,\" I placed the book on my desk. \"Have I burned it; as you can see.\"\"Burn it!\" He shouted. \"Burn it!\"His eyes grew wide in fear.\"Theyll be coming! They sense its presence! Its an unholy beacon! Burn it! Burn it and destroy their only chance for this world!\"\"Not yet.\" I said. \"Not until you tell me why such a normal man would succumb to madness without any reason.\"His emotions changed from frantic to anger in a flash. He started to growl and shake the chair more violently. Either it is due to the cases similar to a grandmother gaining superhuman strength when their grandchild is in danger, or perhaps they did not switch the chains and after dealing with his constant mood swings, they gave. Either way, he was free.Free and wild, like a bull, he charged towards me. I dont know what compelled me to throw the book, but I did. I threw it before he was upon it. And I know, right there, I made a mistake.For when it landed, it landed on the last page where an artists rendition of the writer was present. I stared upon it, mouth agape.\"No!\" He shouted. \"Its all over now.\" He began to sob. \"I didnt want to do this!\" He then sparked up, looking hopeful. \"Wait! Its not too late! You can still reject it! Reject the responsibility and let humanity thrive!\"\"What are you talking about?\" I managed to say.My mind was beginning to form an explanation as to why the famous \"Mad Arab\" looked like me.\"Yes, traitor, what are you talking about?\"\"Nyar…\"He cracked up. \"Nyar…\" He chuckled like a mad man.The new comer was dressed in Ancient Egyptian robes and crown. He was magnificent and regal in appearance. But another sense took over and I wanted to run away from him as quickly as possible. But something caught my eye. Without the help of hand or wind, the pages began to flip back until it reached its goal. The page prior had a picture of him as he was seen now. To the right were the bold words:Nyarlathotep: The Crawling ChaosHe turned towards me. Within those cold black eyes I could see a swirling mass, similar to a galaxy, only different. And, if I strained my ears, I swore I heard the mad playing of deranged flautists.\"Do forgive me, Abdul.\" He said. \"But…\"\"Thats not my name.\" I began. \"My name is…\"\"Not important.\" He said, cutting me off. \"What is, is who you were and who you are meant to be. Abdul Hazred, the Mad Arab and priest to both Cthulhu and Yog-Sothoth.\"Flashes of desert expanses flew by within my mind. A lone man walked alone the desert, walking through an old, abandoned city that once belonged to a reptilian race of humanoids. How he dedicated his remaining years(which was not many) to write the book of which they wanted and whos information he gained through dreams and through physical means.He died and his soul became one with Yog-Sothoth until thirty-four years ago. I was plagued with nightmares and horrible sights that now no longer fill me with dread. Though what my parents did still leaves a mark. But then again, it happened to Abdul, too.(1)\"What is needed of me, Oh mighty Nyarlathotep?\"\"No!\" He shouted, but Nyarlathotep shot him an angry glare.\"I will deal with you later.\" He turned and faced me once more. \"But for now, Abdul must be briefed on what is expected of him.\"You have written The Necronomicon rather well. But, They now wish for you to write one more piece to it. This one will explain what will happen once They are awakened and how to stop the stars from changing again. Youll receive these in dreams once more. But this time, youll receive help in the form of Mr. Briggs, there.\"He cowered in fear of his own surname.\"That is, if you need help.\"\"No,\" I said. \"I shall write this myself. Besides, you called him a traitor. He is not fit to help write such a glorious book.\"\"No!\" He shouted. He had a letter opener in his hands. He was digging through my desk while we were talking. \"He will not write the missing chapter!\"He lunged at me, but was stopped by a loud buzzing sound.\"Id run if I were you.\" Nyarlathotep said.Mr. Briggs did not heed his warning, and lunged at me once more. A Mi-go crashed through the window and grabbed him with his crab-like claws and whisked him out of my office and the sanitarium all together, being prepared for his trip to Yuggoth.\"Do not disappoint me.\" He said and vanished.------ ------1) I know, according to historians, that Abdul Hazred was actually Lovecraft. But, since hes a made up character, why not give him a made up childhood? I am not implying that he was beaten as a child!", "This is based off of real events that have happened to a friend of mine. The impulse Harold has at the beach, the fish, and the dream. Everything else is fictional.IHarold Durby has been my friend since the age of six, having met in kindergarten. A non-native to Florida, unlike myself, he came from Massachusetts-though where has always alluded my mother and father since Harolds single mother always changed the subject.He was a strapping brown haired, blue eyed ball of energy that it was a shock to all that he would befriend me, the class nerd-for at such a young age, I discovered the astounding information that knowledge can give. Yet, we were bound by a shared passion of the ocean. His wide knowledge and love of fish was beyond his years and was always spoken with such passion that it seemed as if he longed to swim beneath the waves forever. And as he grew, it was as if he believed he belonged there more than he did upon land and felt cursed to walk with us humans.And I found myself feeling the same way. Though it was not put to question until his forties, the first sign should have been gleaned on his nineteenth year.Walking along the lonely, early morning beach-our routine since starting high school together(though we graduated at this point)-found us gazing upon a lazy, gray sun rising out of the sea weed infested waves. Minor chit-chat and crashing waves pervaded our silence as gulls stretched their wings and took flight when, out of nowhere, Harold stopped in his tracks, head whipping towards the ocean, eyes cloudy and unfocused.\"Harold,\" I called, trying to gain his attention. \"Harold!\"He took a stiff step towards the ocean, then another, his arms out to his side, palms facing forward like the Virgin Mary as his steps increased. I tugged at his sleeve to break this trance that was placed upon him.We were a good fifteen feet out, the sand beneath us making the cresting waves come up just above his belt, being a couple inches taller than myself, when a whistle blew.\"Get out of the water!\" The lifeguard called from his position on his tower.I looked away from Harold at that moment to see the purple and red flag with a no swimming sign on it. Harold, having been brought back by the whistle, was the first to move back towards land.Panting and chilled by the wind blowing across out wet clothing, I attempted to ask my friend what came upon him. Though he was crouched over, hands on knees, I could see on his face a sort of horror and shock that I have not seen on him before.\"Harold,\" I pushed. \"What came over you?\"\"You didnt hear it?\" He asked, sounding surprised, covering up his fear.\"Hear what?\"\"Then why did you go out with me?\"\"I was trying to snap you out of it.\" I explained.\"Then you didnt hear it?\"\"Hear what?\"He dismissed my question with a shake of his head. \"Forget it, lets just go home.\"I nodded, knowing better than to drop it, but also knowing that Harold would tell me when hes ready.From then on he went to the beach a few more times, but after those times, it was strictly on the sand and never in the water. His claim was that fish kept bumping into him, which is not too unusual, for I have seen their glistening, silver bodies flash beneath the waves-but they never touched any of us, just Harold. Which made him nervous since he wouldnt hurt a fly on purpose, and the murky water doesnt offer much in the way of spying on them.IIMany years pass in a blink of an eye and I find myself in an insurance company(1), while Harold is a marine biologist professor at the local University of Central Florida. In our mid-thirties, we find ourselves successful in our occupations, yet not so in our love life-a fact our mothers love to point out. Though not from a lack of trying, both Harold and myself have tried, but my girlfriends do not last long and, for some odd reason, girls seem to find Harold oddly repulsive. A fact I cannot grasp, for he is a handsome gentleman.But we are content enough with our lives. Though, as was to be expected, since our income was good but not good enough for housing prices, we rented an apartment together.But that veil was quick to be cast away from our eyes. For Harold, from what I could gather, he had night terrors. Screaming out insane verses in tongues befitting gibberish, yet sounded so calculated, so alien, that it hadnt crossed my mind that it couldnt be actual speech. Which frightened me a great deal.And I had asked so frequently that it became routine that when he entered the small dining room that he sardonically stated-more than asked-that he had night terrors, of which I would groggily grunt in the affirmative.Forty reaches us and its like someone turned the volume off. Harold stopped the night terrors when he reached thirty six and a strange acceptance seemed to be permanently stuck on him, a great contrast to the tired and jumpy Harold that I knew during that time. A Harold whos mother would call begging me to pick him up from work because something was off.I didnt think much about it. Night terrors can be overcome, much like any phase of human development, that I was happy when this change occurred. Which then brought up an ancient mystery; the city in which he dwelled before coming to Florida.\"Innsmouth,\" He told me one day. \"Im from Innsmouth, Massachusetts. My mom finally told me.\"\"Thats nice,\" I told him. \"Any reason she told you this now?\"I did not mean for it to sound so rude, but one has to ask why wait so long to tell your son where it was he grew up. By waiting this long why not simply leaving him in the dark? Though not the best option, it seemed more practical then to tell him now. I was curious as any friend would be, though it made those attempts to find out more about the Durbys past seem asinine.His face became unreadable, in deep thought, his features seemed almost fish like in the light.\"She said I need to go back. That I need to go back for a while to understand.\"\"Understand what?\" Came my obvious question when he trailed off into silence.\"She didnt say.\"\"Well, when do you suppose youll go?\"\"This coming week. I know you have vacation time saved up, too. Id like it if you came with me to see the place of my birth and to figure out what my mother meant.\"I was happy that he would ask. Despite the fact that I never cared about that missing piece of Harold, I found myself curious about it now due to his mothers cryptic words.IIIOur first time on a plane and it was nothing like we expected. We boarded on time, but our plane was held fifteen minutes longer. Im glad Harold had the window seat for, from what I saw out of it, I would have went into a panic attack. If man were meant to fly he would have wings.For hours we were stuck up there with minor turbulence, boredom, and anxiety for what we will see once we get off in Boston where we would board a train into Arkham where a cab will need to be hailed for us to proceed into-what the internet called-a dying fishing town. From what we gathered, only a few people still lived there and many of the buildings were run down.No wonder she left. But we were to go there no matter what. For whatever Ms. Durby meant, it was obvious it was eating away at Harold. But I did not push him for details, history has shown me that he will tell me when hes ready.The train ride went off without a scene, but in Arkham, when we hailed a cab, the driver got out to open the back, passenger door when he looked at me then Harold.\"Goin to Innsmouth, eh.\" He stated rather than asked.\"Yes,\" Harold asked. \"How did you know?\"He did not answer, merely motioned for us to get in-which we did-and he got back to the front seat where he drove off without another word.\"You look like yer from there.\" The driver stated, looking at Harold.Strange enough, I had not seen the physical changes from my friend. I suppose spending such a time with someone can allow you to not notice a few things. Like his eyes, they were a dull blue now instead of the vibrant orbs they used to be. His face was becoming rounder on the sides, flatter in the front, and red welts were where neck met shoulders.He never looked that way before, and from what I gather, the people must always look like this. I was confused, but whenever either of us asked him anymore, he would remain silent. Though, when I mentioned that we shall remain there until Friday, he nodded his head and assured us hed be there.We reach Innsmouth by six in the afternoon, the sun already set and the dim glow of a crescent moon fills the night sky along with a plethora of stars you couldnt see in the city. In the dark Innsmouth looked like a deserted, ghost town-the houses and shops, as well as the odd church, looked worse for wear, giving the town an elephant graveyard appeal. The hotel our cab was stationed outside looked nice, yet drearily abandoned.The cab driver then spoke once more to us. \"Please feel free to chose your own rooms. The manager does not reside here anymore. And only two families remain here.\"\"Where is he?\" Harold asked. \"And why so few people?\"\"Out at sea,\" And with that he got back in and drove back to Arkham.With a stretch of paranoia, we climbed the steps in a solemn fashion more befitting a funeral procession than a march to your new-though for only a few days-home. The cab driver was correct, the front desk looked as if the manager had not packed up his things and headed out to sea, the only way to tell how long is to dust through layers of dust and cob-webs.\"Do you really suppose its okay to stay here?\" I asked.\"I dont like it either, but it was unlocked and from what I gather,\" he traced a finger along the banister that was against the far left wall as he ascended the stairs towards the rooms that resided up there. \"He is not coming back. But dont worry, well check the log book if we can and give him the correct amount on Friday should he return.\"I follow him up the steps and to the left theres a hallway with doors carved out of it. Its completely made of wood with generic pictures that adorn almost every hotel across the nation. Harold picks the last one on the left, closest to the end-hallway window which, no doubt, gives the hall its light since the lighting fixtures most likely dont work anymore-where as I picked the last on the right, a few feet away from the window.Our rooms were like a carbon copy from one another; a twin bed, whose head rested against the right wall, across from that the window and a bedside table and another window facing the bed with a door that conjoins rooms to the left of the bed. Throwing my satchel down, I laid on the bed, my conscious still screaming this was wrong, but the very powerful need of sleep overpowered that urge and soon I found myself asleep.The morning came upon us almost too soon, but with both windows letting the celestial orb in with glaring intensity due to dust, we woke up almost blinded.After our short celebration and shouts from room to room that the water actually worked, we showered and headed outside, hopping to meet some of the locals and grab a quick bite to eat-having not eaten since lunch yesterday.The town seemed to be cloistered together, tall brick buildings of which were, for the most part, dusty and abandoned with messy stores, one, a house, even had an upstairs bedroom in the living room. But such is the curse of time. Fortunately, the town is rather small, and as luck would have it one of the families was a baker, for their store was open and pleasant smells wafted from its ovens and like an arrow, hit the mark that was our noses.The inside was styled into a turn of the century bakery with old looking ovens with bread, cakes, and other sweets in a glass case that doubled as a counter. The woman behind it was slightly round around the middle, though the reason came from a cherubic coo in a rocking cradle that she was stooped over. Her sunflower blonde hair was in a librarians bun, her white apron splattered with spots of flour, jellies, and perhaps some genetic material that came from her baby girl.\"Hello, George, come to pick up more bread? Or is it something…\"She looks at us keenly, as if we were joined at the hip-a joke many people have said about us-or something. Then she smiles.\"Well, dont get many visitors around here anymore.\" She said, it was then that I noticed her features that were more pronounced than Harolds and her voice seemed to border on croaking, yet still managed to be cheerful.\"What brings you two boys to Innsmouth?\"\"Im Harold Durby, I was born here.\" Harold stated. I introduced myself before he continued. \"My mom said I had to come back to find my roots.\"\"Youre Alisons brat?\" She said aghast. \"Funniest thing in the world, that one-ran away. Her husband-your father-was so mad, he tore up your house.\" She leaned in closer when the baby sniffled from her mothers loud speaking. Brought their bedroom into the living room.\"I was stunned, that house, the one I thought of as being worse for wear by time, was actually destroyed by Harolds father. What man could possibly do that? And if he can do that, what would he do to Harold? I pale at the thought but the object of my worrisome thoughts break me out of it.\"What happened to my father?\" Harold asked in a manner as if he already knew.\"Went back, boy, went back. Nothing keeping him here and they can…\" She spied me. \"Does he know?\"Harold shook his head. \"Not even I know.\"She was taken aback. \"Your mom ever told you?\"Harold shook his head.\"Figures, nothing right with that one.\" She mumbles off something then smiles again. \"So, how long are you boys in Innsmouth?\"\"Till Friday,\" Harold stated. \"Just to see what I need to see.\"\"Well, come back here after closing, Ill tell you all you need to know. But come alone…We dont take well with outsiders, not like youre not, but youre more one of us than he is. No offense dear, its habit.\"I wasnt offended, merely surprised. Didnt she think Harold would tell me what she tells him? He had no real bond to this place like he did in Florida.\"Anyway, what would you boys like to eat? Dont got much, mostly we go to Ipswich to get supplies, but its a ways, so I tried to lessen our travels by cooking a few things here.\" She then gasps in remembrance. \"I almost forgot. My names Henrietta.\"We ordered our breakfast, ate it, then went on our way. The sights of Innsmouth worth seeing were few; a beach that leads to Devils Cove the docks. But everything was in ill repair, obviously having been neglected by the towns remaining population-however many is uncertain, for we only met Henrietta and her baby.IVThat night I was peacefully sleeping, dreams of sailing in violet skies, my crew and I lax upon the deck, the currents calm enough for daydreaming. But then a pale, blue hand grabbed onto my shoulder and shook me.I woke up to Harolds hand gently shaking my shoulder. A grave expression brought out stress wrinkles, his eyes set in concentration. He sighed, never looking at me as he explained what happened previously.\"I saw the elusive George.\" He explained. \"And their spouses.\"He sighs before he continues:\"You see, Innsmouth was in a bind so they made a pact with these creatures called the Deep Ones. They gave the people fish in exchange for humans to mate with as well as human sacrifices. Henrietta and George are married to them; George even gave up his house and moved to Devils Reef for her.\" He shook his head. \"Still cant get over it; how can anyone love a thing like that?\"But you see, my mother was one of the few non-hybrids left.\"\"Hybrids?\"\"Ill get to that,\" He said dismissively. \"Anyway, my mom didnt like what she was married to. That it touched her. She had me and ran away-I think because she did not want him to hurt me like he does her. She always had him locked in the attic.\"He laughs. \"You see, my friend, those night terrors, I remember ever single one. Cyclopean structures of coral and sand in some of them. In others I see my relatives, alive and kicking as hybrid creatures with blue scales and fish features. I also saw my dad. I saw him run into the night, howling in rage all the while he headed back to Devils Reef; where their city dwells. The first one was this horrible nightmare where you and I were on one of our morning walks when a giant wave crashed down on the both of us, sucking us out to sea. The problem was that you floated to the surface, but I was stuck mere feet away from it.\"\"It was scary, trying to hold in air, fighting to the top, only to discover that I can breathe. But my addled mind begs me to breach the surface, I tug on your pant leg and you notice me. You pull me up a little more then you shout out get away from me! and let me go. My hand turned into a hybrids clawed hand. I sink, fighting it as best I could until youre out of sight.\"He finally looks at me. \"Dont take this the wrong way, but the dreams of losing you were the worst.\"I place a hand on his shoulder. \"You wont lose me.\"The thought of us ever parting never crossed my mind recently. True, the threat to friendship is usually high school, but we overcame that. Were still friends. And even though this story sounds convoluted, Harold was never good at acting. Something really spooked him.\"But you will,\" He counters. \"Tonight my father is coming to take me to Yha-nthlei, their domain. I am to remain there until…\"He is cut off by the sound of something sharp scratching against glass. We both stare at either window, but whatever made that noise had disappeared. Harold stood tense.\"Hes here, I have to go now.\"\"Youre just going to leave me? After everything youre just going to leave?\" I dont know where this is coming from. A part of me screams this should have been said sooner, but I suppose it was until that moment when the reality of the situation we found ourselves in finally sunk in.He looks as if hell cry. But then a thought comes to him.\"Tomorrow at Midnight…Ill meet you at the dock closest to Devils Reef.\"We embrace, silence prevails over all in that brief moment. He breaks away first and runs out into the night.Sleep evades me the rest of the night.VThe next day I hardly venture out into town. Partly because I dare not venture out into this cursed town. A town whos inhabitants, from what I gathered yesterday, did not like outsiders. Yet, strangely enough, I did not starve. Henrietta left goodies for me outside my door with a bill since I wrote on dusty stationary the room had left over that I could not take her charity.Despite being lonely, a sense of anxiety crept over me, for midnight was drawing near.At eleven thirty I ventured out into the night, the crescent moon illuminating my way towards the dock of which our meeting would take place.Once there I only wait a minute until I hear the sound of splashing and a thud of something landing on the dock a few feet behind me. I turn, expecting to see my friend to be as I remembered from last night. But alas, he is not and with a gasp I take him all in.Naked as the day he was born, his body covered in pale, robin eggshell blue, his stomach a pale white. His two eyes have enlarged and have become pitch black orbs. His lips have become fish-like, his gums holding rows of sharp teeth, framed nicely on his hairless head; hair being replaced with frills like that of fish fins. Yet, despite the fish-like qualities, it seemed that amphibian qualities were also present.He walks towards me in an awkward gait on his webbed toes until he is close enough to cup my cheek with his webbed, right hand.The gesture was merely for comfort and reassurance that he was still himself. I grasped his hand with my own and he lets out a purr-like hiss.\"Friend,\" He croaks, his voice coming out even more awkward than his gait, as if his vocal cords were not made for such a feat, yet was able to anyway. \"Missed you.\"\"Missed you, too, Harold.\" I admitted.\"Go back to Florida.

{"id": "EN001", "pair": ["The world we live in is not as it seems. I, James White, write this document so that others may be made aware of what I have experienced and know of the dangers that lurk beneath our limited perception of \"reality\". Whether you believe me or not, dear reader, is up to you. I only ask that you read what I write with an open mind since I write, not for my own gain, but to warn you of what I can only describe as \"pure evil\".I had never heard of the \"Cult of Cthulhu\" before I began university in the late summer of 2012. I was only eighteen years old, an atheist, and dogmatically pursued scientific understanding and knowledge. At that time, I was not in the least bit interested in weird cults and other religious movements, which I simply dismissed as primitive superstition. Had I but known what I would encounter, I would have burnt the science textbook, prayed to God for the strength not to crumble into insanity and got as far away from that university as I could!The strange happenings started less than two months into my first term. I had been put into student accommodation and shared a corridor with four other boys and two girls. I had got to know my flatmates very well until all of a sudden, one of the boys by the name of Jonathan Mears disappeared. This wasnt looked upon as weird at first since Jonathan was the quiet type anyway and often spent long hours alone in his room. The suspicions arose however, when he hadnt shown his face for three days. His absence was brought up one evening as we sat in a communal area.\"Hes probably just been very busy lately,\" my best friend, Jacob Shields, said. \"You know Jonathan. When he sets his mind on something, he doesnt stop until hes achieved whatever hes trying to do.\"\"Isnt it a bit strange though?\" Annie Roberts, a lovely blonde girl from the room directly across the corridor asked. \"I mean, hes in our corridor and we havent seen him for ages. Not even in the kitchen or lecture halls.\"\"It isnt like him to miss a lecture,\" I agreed. Jacob merely waved these concerns away.\"If we havent seen him by tomorrow evening, well go to the reception and see whats happening,\" he said cheerfully.But Jonathan didnt show up the following day and, as planned, my entire corridor went to the reception desk to ask if anything had happened to him. The receptionist, an elderly lady, checked through the files on a computer before looking up at us.\"Im afraid he has left the university,\" she informed us. \"He dropped out four days ago.\"\"Well there you go!\" Jacob exclaimed. \"Nothing to worry about!\"But there was something to worry about. Even though I now had every reason to think that Jonathan was fine, I couldnt shake that feeling of foreboding. He had seemed happy in university and was consistently getting high marks so I resolved to check things out for myself.I waited until 3:00 the following morning, and in the darkness, I tiptoed along the corridor to Jonathans room. Using a paperclip, I carefully picked the lock on his door and let myself in. I closed the door behind me and switched on the light. The sight that greeted me came as a huge shock. Clothes still lay on the floor, the bed was made, books were still on the shelves and a laptop was still humming gently on the cluttered desk. In short, it looked as though Jonathan was simply out of the room. If he had gone home, why did he leave all his things behind? And if he hadnt, where was he and why did the university records state that he had? Deeply concerned, I left the room and returned to my own. I lay awake in the darkness pondering the thoughts in my head and finally decided that I needed to find out what had happened and that I would do so alone...", "VII.Yet all this was only the prologue of the actual Dunwich horror. Formalities were gone through by bewildered officials, abnormal details were duly kept from press and public, and men were sent to Dunwich and Aylesbury to look up property and notify any who might be heirs of the late Wilbur Whateley. They found the countryside in great agitation, both because of the growing rumblings beneath the domed hills, and because of the unwonted stench and the surging, lapping sounds which came increasingly from the great empty shell formed by Whateley’s boarded-up farmhouse. Earl Sawyer, who tended the horse and cattle during Wilbur’s absence, had developed a woefully acute case of nerves. The officials devised excuses not to enter the noisome boarded place; and were glad to confine their survey of the deceased’s living quarters, the newly mended sheds, to a single visit. They filed a ponderous report at the court-house in Aylesbury, and litigations concerning heirship are said to be still in progress amongst the innumerable Whateleys, decayed and undecayed, of the upper Miskatonic valley.      An almost interminable manuscript in strange characters, written in a huge ledger and adjudged a sort of diary because of the spacing and the variations in ink and penmanship, presented a baffling puzzle to those who found it on the old bureau which served as its owner’s desk. After a week of debate it was sent to Miskatonic University, together with the deceased’s collection of strange books, for study and possible translation; but even the best linguists soon saw that it was not likely to be unriddled with ease. No trace of the ancient gold with which Wilbur and Old Whateley always paid their debts has yet been discovered.      It was in the dark of September 9th that the horror broke loose. The hill noises had been very pronounced during the evening, and dogs barked frantically all night. Early risers on the 10th noticed a peculiar stench in the air. About seven o’clock Luther Brown, the hired boy at George Corey’s, between Cold Spring Glen and the village, rushed frenziedly back from his morning trip to Ten-Acre Meadow with the cows. He was almost convulsed with fright as he stumbled into the kitchen; and in the yard outside the no less frightened herd were pawing and lowing pitifully, having followed the boy back in the panic they shared with him. Between gasps Luther tried to stammer out his tale to Mrs. Corey.      “Up thar in the rud beyont the glen, Mis’ Corey—they’s suthin’ ben thar! It smells like thunder, an’ all the bushes an’ little trees is pushed back from the rud like they’d a haouse ben moved along of it. An’ that ain’t the wust, nuther. They’s prints in the rud, Mis’ Corey—great raound prints as big as barrel-heads, all sunk daown deep like a elephant had ben along, only they’s a sight more nor four feet could make! I looked at one or two afore I run, an’ I see every one was covered with lines spreadin’ aout from one place, like as if big palm-leaf fans—twict or three times as big as any they is—hed of ben paounded daown into the rud. An’ the smell was awful, like what it is araound Wizard Whateley’s ol’ haouse. . . .”      Here he faltered, and seemed to shiver afresh with the fright that had sent him flying home. Mrs. Corey, unable to extract more information, began telephoning the neighbours; thus starting on its rounds the overture of panic that heralded the major terrors. When she got Sally Sawyer, housekeeper at Seth Bishop’s, the nearest place to Whateley’s, it became her turn to listen instead of transmit; for Sally’s boy Chauncey, who slept poorly, had been up on the hill toward Whateley’s, and had dashed back in terror after one look at the place, and at the pasturage where Mr. Bishop’s cows had been left out all night.      “Yes, Mis’ Corey,” came Sally’s tremulous voice over the party wire, “Cha’ncey he just come back a-postin’, and couldn’t haff talk fer bein’ scairt! He says Ol’ Whateley’s haouse is all blowed up, with the timbers scattered raound like they’d ben dynamite inside; only the bottom floor ain’t through, but is all covered with a kind o’ tar-like stuff that smells awful an’ drips daown offen the aidges onto the graoun’ whar the side timbers is blown away. An’ they’s awful kinder marks in the yard, tew—great raound marks bigger raound than a hogshead, an’ all sticky with stuff like is on the blowed-up haouse. Cha’ncey he says they leads off into the medders, whar a great swath wider’n a barn is matted daown, an’ all the stun walls tumbled every whichway wherever it goes.      “An’ he says, says he, Mis’ Corey, as haow he sot to look fer Seth’s caows, frighted ez he was; an’ faound ’em in the upper pasture nigh the Devil’s Hop Yard in an awful shape. Haff on ’em’s clean gone, an’ nigh haff o’ them that’s left is sucked most dry o’ blood, with sores on ’em like they’s ben on Whateley’s cattle ever senct Lavinny’s black brat was born. Seth he’s gone aout naow to look at ’em, though I’ll vaow he wun’t keer ter git very nigh Wizard Whateley’s! Cha’ncey didn’t look keerful ter see whar the big matted-daown swath led arter it leff the pasturage, but he says he thinks it p’inted towards the glen rud to the village.      “I tell ye, Mis’ Corey, they’s suthin’ abroad as hadn’t orter be abroad, an’ I for one think that black Wilbur Whateley, as come to the bad eend he desarved, is at the bottom of the breedin’ of it. He wa’n’t all human hisself, I allus says to everybody; an’ I think he an’ Ol’ Whateley must a raised suthin’ in that there nailed-up haouse as ain’t even so human as he was. They’s allus ben unseen things araound Dunwich—livin’ things—as ain’t human an’ ain’t good fer human folks.      “The graoun’ was a-talkin’ lass night, an’ towards mornin’ Cha’ncey he heerd the whippoorwills so laoud in Col’ Spring Glen he couldn’t sleep nun. Then he thought he heerd another faint-like saound over towards Wizard Whateley’s—a kinder rippin’ or tearin’ o’ wood, like some big box er crate was bein’ opened fur off. What with this an’ that, he didn’t git to sleep at all till sunup, an’ no sooner was he up this mornin’, but he’s got to go over to Whateley’s an’ see what’s the matter. He see enough, I tell ye, Mis’ Corey! This dun’t mean no good, an’ I think as all the men-folks ought to git up a party an’ do suthin’. I know suthin’ awful’s abaout, an’ feel my time is nigh, though only Gawd knows jest what it is.      “Did your Luther take accaount o’ whar them big tracks led tew? No? Wal, Mis’ Corey, ef they was on the glen rud this side o’ the glen, an’ ain’t got to your haouse yet, I calc’late they must go into the glen itself. They would do that. I allus says Col’ Spring Glen ain’t no healthy nor decent place. The whippoorwills an’ fireflies there never did act like they was creaters o’ Gawd, an’ they’s them as says ye kin hear strange things a-rushin’ an’ a-talkin’ in the air daown thar ef ye stand in the right place, atween the rock falls an’ Bear’s Den.”      By that noon fully three-quarters of the men and boys of Dunwich were trooping over the roads and meadows between the new-made Whateley ruins and Cold Spring Glen, examining in horror the vast, monstrous prints, the maimed Bishop cattle, the strange, noisome wreck of the farmhouse, and the bruised, matted vegetation of the fields and roadsides. Whatever had burst loose upon the world had assuredly gone down into the great sinister ravine; for all the trees on the banks were bent and broken, and a great avenue had been gouged in the precipice-hanging underbrush. It was as though a house, launched by an avalanche, had slid down through the tangled growths of the almost vertical slope. From below no sound came, but only a distant, undefinable foetor; and it is not to be wondered at that the men preferred to stay on the edge and argue, rather than descend and beard the unknown Cyclopean horror in its lair. Three dogs that were with the party had barked furiously at first, but seemed cowed and reluctant when near the glen. Someone telephoned the news to the Aylesbury Transcript; but the editor, accustomed to wild tales from Dunwich, did no more than concoct a humorous paragraph about it; an item soon afterward reproduced by the Associated Press.      That night everyone went home, and every house and barn was barricaded as stoutly as possible. Needless to say, no cattle were allowed to remain in open pasturage. About two in the morning a frightful stench and the savage barking of the dogs awakened the household at Elmer Frye’s, on the eastern edge of Cold Spring Glen, and all agreed that they could hear a sort of muffled swishing or lapping sound from somewhere outside. Mrs. Frye proposed telephoning the neighbours, and Elmer was about to agree when the noise of splintering wood burst in upon their deliberations. It came, apparently, from the barn; and was quickly followed by a hideous screaming and stamping amongst the cattle. The dogs slavered and crouched close to the feet of the fear-numbed family. Frye lit a lantern through force of habit, but knew it would be death to go out into that black farmyard. The children and the womenfolk whimpered, kept from screaming by some obscure, vestigial instinct of defence which told them their lives depended on silence. At last the noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful moaning, and a great snapping, crashing, and crackling ensued. The Fryes, huddled together in the sitting-room, did not dare to move until the last echoes died away far down in Cold Spring Glen. Then, amidst the dismal moans from the stable and the daemoniac piping of late whippoorwills in the glen, Selina Frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she could of the second phase of the horror.      The next day all the countryside was in a panic; and cowed, uncommunicative groups came and went where the fiendish thing had occurred. Two titan swaths of destruction stretched from the glen to the Frye farmyard, monstrous prints covered the bare patches of ground, and one side of the old red barn had completely caved in. Of the cattle, only a quarter could be found and identified. Some of these were in curious fragments, and all that survived had to be shot. Earl Sawyer suggested that help be asked from Aylesbury or Arkham, but others maintained it would be of no use. Old Zebulon Whateley, of a branch that hovered about half way between soundness and decadence, made darkly wild suggestions about rites that ought to be practiced on the hill-tops. He came of a line where tradition ran strong, and his memories of chantings in the great stone circles were not altogether connected with Wilbur and his grandfather.      Darkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organise for real defence. In a few cases closely related families would band together and watch in the gloom under one roof; but in general there was only a repetition of the barricading of the night before, and a futile, ineffective gesture of loading muskets and setting pitchforks handily about. Nothing, however, occurred except some hill noises; and when the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had gone as swiftly as it had come. There were even bold souls who proposed an offensive expedition down in the glen, though they did not venture to set an actual example to the still reluctant majority.      When night came again the barricading was repeated, though there was less huddling together of families. In the morning both the Frye and the Seth Bishop households reported excitement among the dogs and vague sounds and stenches from afar, while early explorers noted with horror a fresh set of the monstrous tracks in the road skirting Sentinel Hill. As before, the sides of the road shewed a bruising indicative of the blasphemously stupendous bulk of the horror; whilst the conformation of the tracks seemed to argue a passage in two directions, as if the moving mountain had come from Cold Spring Glen and returned to it along the same path. At the base of the hill a thirty-foot swath of crushed shrubbery saplings led steeply upward, and the seekers gasped when they saw that even the most perpendicular places did not deflect the inexorable trail. Whatever the horror was, it could scale a sheer stony cliff of almost complete verticality; and as the investigators climbed around to the hill’s summit by safer routes they saw that the trail ended—or rather, reversed—there.      It was here that the Whateleys used to build their hellish fires and chant their hellish rituals by the table-like stone on May-Eve and Hallowmass. Now that very stone formed the centre of a vast space thrashed around by the mountainous horror, whilst upon its slightly concave surface was a thick and foetid deposit of the same tarry stickiness observed on the floor of the ruined Whateley farmhouse when the horror escaped. Men looked at one another and muttered. Then they looked down the hill. Apparently the horror had descended by a route much the same as that of its ascent. To speculate was futile. Reason, logic, and normal ideas of motivation stood confounded. Only old Zebulon, who was not with the group, could have done justice to the situation or suggested a plausible explanation.      Thursday night began much like the others, but it ended less happily. The whippoorwills in the glen had screamed with such unusual persistence that many could not sleep, and about 3 A.M. all the party telephones rang tremulously. Those who took down their receivers heard a fright-mad voice shriek out, “Help, oh, my Gawd! . . .” and some thought a crashing sound followed the breaking off of the exclamation. There was nothing more. No one dared do anything, and no one knew till morning whence the call came. Then those who had heard it called everyone on the line, and found that only the Fryes did not reply. The truth appeared an hour later, when a hastily assembled group of armed men trudged out to the Frye place at the head of the glen. It was horrible, yet hardly a surprise. There were more swaths and monstrous prints, but there was no longer any house. It had caved in like an egg-shell, and amongst the ruins nothing living or dead could be discovered. Only a stench and a tarry stickiness. The Elmer Fryes had been erased from Dunwich."]}
{"id": "EN066", "pair": ["The Great Arising was far worse than anyone could have imagined, how can one comprehend the forces that can wrench an entire continent from deep beneath the murky abyss until its twisted green-black spires towered over even the highest of mountains known to man? When Ryleh arose, millions returned to life, but billions of others died. The geologic upheavals, the shifting of plates swallowed whole countries and ground mighty cities to dust. Tidal waves swept hundreds of miles inland, wiping away much of the world as if it had never existed. Those who survived were in chaos, of the major world powers, only Russia retained some capability to strike back, and a hail of nuclear warheads struck the mighty walls of Ryleh, accomplishing nothing but achieving Great Cthulhus disfavor, and Moscow was struck with such force by the mighty priests weapons that an inland sea now sits where one of mans greatest super-powers once stood.America fared no better, the entire west coast collapsed beneath an earthquake of unthinkable magnitude, from California to Mississippi river, the east coast was left in ruins by what later scholars would term a \"worldquake\" . The shattered survivors, staring into the dust filled sky, watched as great, bloated creatures with dragons bodies and tentacled faces swarmed across the earth, eager to reclaim their world. Of course, there was resistance, in the early years, men struck out at the Star Spawn with every weapon at their disposal, and always the result was the same, the Star Spawn could not be injured, as they existed in multiple dimensions at once. Cthulhus other servants, however, were more vulnerable. Human cultists could be easily killed, and the amphibious Deep Ones, though hardier than men, were only flesh and blood. Man soon learned, however, that such small victories brought attention and terrible reprisal, so much so that humanity finally ceased to fight, struggling to simply survive beneath the feet of a race that barely even noticed their very existence.In truth, Cthulhu was not malevolent, simply amoral, beyond human concerns and desires. He neither desired nor caused most of the devastation wrecked upon humanity by the Rise of Rlyeh. Had he control over Rlyehs rising and falling, it would never have sunken to begin with. The sidereal clockworks governed Rlyeh and its inhabitants. When the stars were wrong they had to sleep, when the stars were right, they wee free to walk and fly and crawl. It was that simple. Humanity had suffered the simple misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, nothing more. Those that fought Great Cthulhu and his kin were minor irritants at best, his worshipers, useful beasts, of a little more import than Shoggoths, and a little less than The Brood of Dagon. The rest, simply another breed of animal that had flourished during his long sleep. Insignificant creatures which could be used to further his grand designs. Bizarrely, despite this view of humanity, Great Cthulhu had several children by human, or once human, mates, via some of his more humanoid avatars, of course. The children of these unions were known as Half-Bloods.This was fortunate, in many ways, for mankind. Great Cthulhu and his minions saw humans as useful pawns, if they saw them at all, so mankind was able to regroup into a primitive society, surviving under the radar. The Star Spawn rarely noticed the affairs of men, but the Half-Bloods did. The Half-Bloods, more often than not, hated their human side, feeling the need to be excessively cruel and brutal toward the people whose blood they so despised within their own veins. Some, however, were kindly disposed toward mankind...Torren-Wraeth was the son of an avatar of Great Cthulhu and Teree, an outcast woman of the Rapa Nui people, born on the island of the same name, which the Europeans would later re-name Easter Island. In form and mind he took more after his mothers people than his fathers. In many ways, he was attractive, even beautiful by human standards, though his striking Polynesian features and lithe swimmers build were offset by a eight small tendrils, three on each side of his lower jaw and two on his chin, his skin was emerald green rather than his mothers warm brown, his almond eyes yellow and cat-like, and slender, bat-like wings that spread from his shoulders. His straight black hair hung long and loose around his pointed ears, though occasionally he would braid it, for special occasions.He did not hate his human side, rather, he embraced it. His name, given by his father, loosely translated as Spirit of the Raging Waters, but his personality was far different, though his mothers people were fierce warriors and his fathers, cold, calculating and unfeeling, Torren-Wraeth was gentle. He befriended humans, or tried to, both before and after the Rise of Rlyeh. Teree still lived, she had been transformed into something more than human, but less than Star-Spawn, another of his fathers many concubines.As a Half-Blood Torren-Wraeth possessed abilities his True-Blood brethren lacked, while they could only communicate with human minds in sleep, Torren-Wraeth could communicate mentally with humans sleeping or awake, and, unlike his kin, he possessed vocal chords capable of actual human conversation. This, combined with his attractive appearance and gentle manner, made him a frequent messenger between his father and the humans who worshiped him. The Elder Sign, bane of his father and those like him, even other Half-Bloods, held no power over Torren-Wraeth. He did not know if this was a sign of favor from the Elder Gods whod crafted that mystical defense, or due to some innate part of his human nature.Rapa Nui... The people had all but died out long before the rise of Rlyeh, a combination of factors had led to their demise, systematic deforestation, a genocidal internecine war, followed by starvation. The final nail in the coffin of the Rapa Nui was the arrival of the Europeans in 1722, who brought with them disease, mistreatment and slavery. Torren-Wraeth had wanted to help them, even though they had rejected his mother, rejected him... He had implored his father to intervene, but to no avail. They were not servants of Cthulhu... Torren-Wraeth had never truly forgiven his father...The island itself, with its famous Moai statues, now rested in a low valley on the Southwestern portion of Rlyeh, if such directions could be applied to the non-euclidean, extra-dimensional hyper-geometry of the dark city. Its few inhabitants, mostly descended of mixed Rapa Nui and European blood, now lived literally in the shadows of Rlyeh . Torren-Wraeth visited often, protecting his mothers people. He erected again the fallen Moai, many toppled by the Rapa Nui themselves during and after their horrific civil war, moving tons of stone with his bare hands. It was important to him, so much human blood, sweat and tears had gone into the making of the Moai, they symbolized the pride of a people, his people.Torren-Wraeth flapped his leathery wings lazily, mainly gliding along the strong winds that whipped through the black city whose structures loomed higher than the eye could see. Occasionally one of his massive half-siblings would glide by, surprisingly graceful for their incredible size, or stare impassively out from the portals of their stone domiciles. He knew they neither loved nor hated him, they merely acknowledged his existence even as they acknowledged their own. A cold, unfeeling people, the Cthuli, H.G. Wells description of his Martian Minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic aptly fit the Star Spawn . Far below him, Torren-Wraeth could see the slithering shapes of near-mindless Shoggoths, and he strained to see if, by chance, a Deep One, a Gyo-Jin, as his dearest friend had called them, lurked below. At least they had some feelings akin to those of humanity. He saw none. He was utterly alone in a city of millions.Then the loneliness, the aching struck at his heart. Japan was gone, destroyed in the tectonic cataclysm of The Arising. Though Rapa Nui was his birthplace, his heart had been in Japan. Many years ago, his father had sent him to that land to forge an alliance with the Emperor. The alliance had been refused, but while in Japan he had met Goro. Goro had been assigned as his personal servant during his stay, and the two had become fast-friends, once the seemingly insurmountable barriers of class were broken. He had healed Goros troubled mind, entering his dreams, soothing his nightmares. Goro had lived a life of suffering and loss, and his nights were filled with terrible nightmares and even more terrible realities, something that touched Torren-Wraeths heart. For the first time, he truly felt human suffering, he truly understood that side of himself, all the hopes and fears and pains... Such pain...When he left Japan, he took Goro with him. They traveled the world for over 200 years, Torren-Wraeth drawing on his fathers power to keep Goro young and healthy. They truly cared for each other, like brothers born. Torren-Wraeth even allowed Goro to call him Torren-kun, no one, other than his mother, could have referred to Torren-Wraeth like that. But Goro was different... He would even have accepted Torren-chan, though Goro never could shake off his shackles of low-self esteem to be so familiar with the son of Kami... Hed never truly understood, Torren-Wraeth needed Goro far more than Goro needed him. Goro made him feel... Human...Hed truly loved him, not in the way of ... Shonen-Ai, was it called? Even if Torren-Wraeth had been so inclined, Goro had already suffered far too much of that kind of love. It was difficult for Torren-Wraeth to describe in the terms of either of his parents tongues, a blending of souls, perhaps? He was a companion, a friend to whom he could open up his innermost heart without fear, and he strove to repay such care in kind. But time takes its toll, and Goro simply began to lose interest in this life, he yearned to be reunited with his long-dead family, and, finally, Torren-Wraeth let him go. He visited him often, watching in his ageless agony as Goro raised a family, grew old, and finally died. Death, even Half-Bloods had little concept of death, such loss was unknown to his fathers people. He had experienced loss for the first time in his young life, and this foreign agony crushed him. The pain he felt had never truly gone away, it had left a gaping hole in his soul... A void as deep and dark as the gulf between worlds. He had wept and raged and screamed to the heavens, angry at himself for letting Goro die, angry at Goro for wanting to live as a normal man, for wanting to die. But he came to accept that forcing immortality upon Goro would have been cruel, forcing him to live a life he no longer wanted just for his own sake would have been selfish. He had finally come to peace with himself,but God, did he miss him...Goros descendants were safe, though, even if Japan was gone, Torren-Wraeth had saved them, guiding them for decades, preparing them the best he could. He finally took them to the relative safety of Canada as the end became certain, gave them the signs and words to ward off any of his kin who might do them harm. It was the best he could do, under the circumstances.The jumbled spires of Rlyeh fell away, opening onto a gloomy sea. He shook his head to clear his thoughts. Africa lay ahead, just a short jaunt on his powerful wings. The survival of Africa was almost as miraculous as the survival of Australia (which was directly adjacent to Ryleh), buffeted by tsunamis and earthquakes, rent and torn almost beyond recognition, but still there.He turned to look back, and the greenish-black stone of Rlyeh blocked his view for as far as he could see, blotting out horizon and sky with its incredible bulk. It was unnatural, in more ways than one, Rlyeh was less a continent than a great, graven image to Great Cthulhu and to his god, Yog-Sothoth, The Key and The Gate. Torren-Wraeth knew that, someday, Rlyeh would simply fade away from its earthly presence and re-appear on some other, more desirable world. They were, after all, only temporary residents on this planet, Rlyeh was little more than a great city-engine to leech all it could from earth before leaving for greener pastures in an endless, soulless cycle of domination and devastation. He hoped silently that humanity would live to see that day when Great Cthulhu and his hordes left their world forever. He often wondered, if, when that day came, he would go with them...But he knew the answer to that. He would go. He had to go. The humans had a saying, at least before the Great Arising \"Hell is other people\", but they were wrong, oh so wrong. Hell is being alone...", "Rodrigo: (Laughing) \"Horror? You speak to me of horror? I have seen things which would make the gods tremble!\"Massa di Requiem per ShuggayAct II Scene IVBenevento Chieti Bordighera(Translated from the original Italian)Torren-Wraeth hated being summoned. He hated human sacrifice even more. After all, his mother had been human, but he could not act against his fathers wishes, nor those who had summoned him, at least, not directly. He was here merely to witness, to stand helpless as a life was taken.The youth stood, tall and handsome, his striking Polynesian features offset by his green skin and six slender tendrils that lined his chin and jaw. He was in a house, surrounded by black-robed humans, cult artifacts and blazing braziers. A young man lay upon a stone table, bound, screaming. Torren-Wraeth walked over to the table, regret in his glistening yellow eyes, \"Im so sorry.\" The mans bulging eyes stared past him, followed two of the cultists as they moved toward a spot near the west wall of the basement/temple, strained with terror.The worshipers began to chant, and one among them called out in a loud voice, \"For the glory of Great Cthulhu, we offer this one to The Beast Below!\"\"My father does not need sacrifices...\" Torren-Wraeth said loudly. That was true, to a point. His father did not, in fact, need sacrifices, but he did desire them. Perhaps, he could save this one... But they ignored him. He watched as the men rolled back a large stone, revealing a dark hole beneath. Ghouls? Ghouls can be reasoned with, better than some humans... He frowned, spoke louder \"I said, my father...\"Then it hit him. A noxious smell poured forth through the opening, gagging him. It was not the familiar, moldy corpse smell of ghouls, but something bizarre, like ammonia and drying blood... And there was something else, something far, far worse. Voices. Many voices. Laughing madly, weeping, screaming. Screaming such as Torren-Wraeth had never heard in his life; the horrific, hopeless shrieking of the damned.He unconsciously backed away as a huge form slithered slowly from the deepest region of the pit. Torren-Wraeth nearly vomited at the sight. It was similar in shape to a worm, blood-colored and slimy, but that was not the true horror of the thing, it was its faces... A grinning, evil human face peered from the anterior of the beast, but dozens of other anguished, maddened human faces protruded at random from its hideous form. Their eyes reflected unspeakable torment, madness, and a longing for the release of death. Some babbled or laughed senselessly, others begged for death or wept, or just screamed... So many faces, so much unholy suffering. It turned toward the sacrificial table and its occupant.At the sight the victim screamed in utter terror, but his voice was drowned out by the many voices of the thing. Torren-Wraeth had heard of such things, but had not believed, had hoped that they did not exist.The Chakota.An abomination which absorbed its victims, body and mind, leaving its unfortunate prey trapped within its hateful body, aware but helpless. The first head, the mind of the beast, was the cultist who had willingly created it, literally became the beast, the others the miserable wretches it had absorbed over the years.Torren-Wraeths body turned pale yellow with horror. He had seen so much evil and cruelty in his life, but this, this was vile beyond all reason. The Binding broke with his terror. He was free to act.His reaction was instinctive, human.He screamed, grabbed the nearest brazier, and struck at the beast with it.The Chakota itself screamed as the coals and flames struck its slimy flesh, and it was alight. Torren-Wraeth struck at it again and again, scattering flaming coal across the room, igniting tapestries and furnishings. More braziers were knocked over by the beasts own struggles and the cultists scrambling for the stairs. The stone floor grew hot, and the walls caught fire. The Chakota turned to flee toward its hole, towards cool, dark safety, but Torren-Wraeth drove the broken brazier through it like a stake, pinning it in place. There was no escape.The flames danced across the stones.As the fire raged around him, Torren-Wraeth turned to the sacrificial victim, intending to free him, but a quick glance revealed that the man was dead, his face contorted in terror. He had died of fear.In some ways, he was lucky. He wondered how many of the cultists had died in the fire, and had the brief, dark feeling that they deserved it. He pushed it from his mind.He turned his attention back to the Chakota.The beast writhed in agony. The screams grew louder, shriller, while, from some of the faces trapped within the beast, came shouts of joy and thanksgiving. Facing the flames was preferable to living within the beast...Though it was obscured by smoke and flames, Torren-Wraeth watched as the Chakota quickly shriveled and blackened, withered like a worm on a hot sidewalk.Then, there were only ashes.The fire was spreading too quickly, the heat was intense, he had to leave or risk injury himself. Torren-Wraeth teleported away, leaving the cleansing fire to its work.He returned home. Not RLyeh, but Rapa Nui, which the white men called Easter Island.He threw up, then wept...Later,Torren-Wraeth stood within an ancient quarry, partially carved Moai bearing mute witness to his words. \"No more! No more human sacrifices!\" He shouted at the top of his lungs. He didnt care about the consequences. He had ignored his conscience, his honor for too long.\"You go where you are summoned!\" Great Cthulhus telepathic voice, calling out from his body in RLyeh, registered rage at this defiance.\"Never again!\" Torren-Wraeths voice was firm. He was ashamed that he had ever been party to such a thing, and he refused to do so again. His skin was blotched with conflicting emotion, \"You dont even need sacrifices, much less intelligent ones! I wont help you commit murder, not anymore!\"\"Who are you to judge me!?\"Torren-Wraeth fell silent.Great Cthulhu sighed, his child was becoming sentimental, rebellious. It was his mothers blood, it could not be helped. Ever since he had befriended that human, he had become more like them... Still, it was a small thing. \"Very well, Torren-Wraeth, from now on you will never represent me at a sentient sacrifice again.\"The boy knelt quickly, \"Thank you, father...\"\"Do not thank me yet, I may ask something of you in return.\"And Torren-Wraeth knew without a doubt that he would."]}
{"id": "EN032", "pair": ["The Inn stands at the end of our largest thoroughfare, which is a few blocks long, but seems a thousand miles. With my heavy valise, Im fortunate that I only have to walk half that far from the restaurant at which Ive just dined. Once every month, I scrounge up enough money to have dinner at the Golden Goose. Despite my reputation in this village, I eventually come to long for the clamor of a crowd. The four walls of my fathers house are my sanctuary and prison otherwise. Only Theodora, our cook and housekeeper that weve had since before I was born, keeps me company there. I would take her with me on my monthly outings to Leights sole restaurant, but she stubbornly says she prefers her own meals all the same.Thats only part of the reason why she wont go, however. Ive told her that even at the Golden Goose, the diners there glare at me out of the corners of their eyes and lower them to their plates if I look their way. Theodora is an even more self-contained soul than I am, and loathes being stared at \"by all and sundry\".The evening sun is sinking low on the horizon, and the villagers around me are concealed in shadows. I dont want anyone coming up and asking me about my three-night errand - not that they would. When I prove the rumors about my forefathers establishment wrong, Ill make them all look like fools anyway!Those unfamiliar with Leight will notice three ever-present things as they travel down its main street: stalwart people, churches, and Cemetery Hill looming in the distance. Ever since I was a child, I sensed an eerie connection among these features of our humble village. Just what that is, I cannot say. They are ordinary enough on the surface, and yet I cant help feeling that theres something sinister about them.My neighbors are proud, hard-working souls. Most of them live on farms on the outskirts of town. Even so, they trudge nearly every day to its center in order to seek supplies. The men of Leight are burly, with long arms and sunburnt faces, trusting in their toil and suspicious of learnt folk. Its just as well that theyre illiterate. They wouldnt have much use for books even if they had the coin to buy them. Their wives, far from being what some people would call ladies, are just as industrious and sturdy as their husbands. I see them more often in town, as buying sundries is womens work, but that doesnt mean theyre any more inclined to talk to me. They keep to themselves, as I do, but it seems their hearts are under lock and key.I suspect that a large part of this has to do with the fact that they fear God as much as my familys past. Out of every ten buildings in Leight, at least four are churches. The Baptists, Catholics, Episcopalians, Evangelicals, Lutherans, Methodists, and even more denominations are continually at war. They each claim to believe in the Scriptures, and in the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. However, they also claim that all the others are false, to a greater or lesser degree. As for me? I attend no house of worship, and that is no great loss to me. My father, Lemuel Dawson, said that his own chapel - the one on Cemetery Hill - had been abruptly shuttered one Halloween night. His fellow congregants then fled to other nearby towns.\"My dear Millie,\" he had told me, \"the one true church on this Earth has been lost, and a year too early.\" Thats another thing Ive failed to understand, even though it haunts me as much as the Inn itself does.Hurrying to get there, I pass the people and churches without much concern. Only the visage of the former Gallows Hill, now containing graves instead of a gibbet, catches my eye. Buried there are not only the fifty-three souls who were hanged during the Purge (or so we called our witchcraft panic), but criminals and paupers. Ive often wondered why having no money is considered as great a crime as sorcery or theft, but in this village, if youre poor, then you are cursed. \"God helps those who help themselves\": so say we. I cannot help myself as I find my feet sprinting rather than walking toward the façade of the Dreamers Inn.The sky, now a cool blue-violet twilight, is growing dark. Ill soon leave light (and Leight?) behind. Even though Ive been inside the Dreamers Inn countless times, Ive always been a bit scared of the place. Why is it that, even though its supposed to be a haven for travelers, it seems like a mausoleum instead? I know that once I venture beyond its door, beneath the rickety sign that has announced its presence since the days of Abner Dawes, Ill be in a world unto itself. As such, I pause on the threshold and gaze up at its intimidating turret. Should I turn back and forget about spending a single night there, let alone three?Then I remember my reasons, both monetary and otherwise, and step inside.", "Spoonbill Village, Northernmost Quang Bin Province, SRVJune 29, 2011As the two young adults stared at each other, nothing but shock registered in either of their brains. Not the stares of the villagers nor of Josephs classmates affected them in their surprise. For Joseph, the shock was mixed with relief at finding his girlfriend safe, concern about his own impending fate as the main course and a strange confusion about what the heck was going on. For Marie, it was the sheer shock of actually seeing her boyfriend here and her puzzlement at the reason why that added to her numb bewilderment, not to mention the fear for his life at what might happen next.As the shock broke, she knew that she had to act. And since the village chief was here...\"You cannot sacrifice this man! His family are allies are of my parents, his parents are involved in our business. If anything happens to him, calamity will come upon us all!\" Demanding such things of the chieftain might have been rude, presumptuous and even insulting, but everything she said was the truth. If Joseph died, things would go down the toilet very quickly.Before the men could answer back, the crashing of a great bronze gong echoed over the crowd and all heads turned towards the source of the cacophony, the temple. Coming down the steps was a red lacquered palanquin with red curtains. Four men in deeply-hooded red robes supported the wooden structure, its bracing poles upon their shoulders. As they reached the courtyard proper, one of the warriors who had exited the large house went up to the palanquin, distinguished from the others by leather shoes on his feet, a broad circlet of gold around his black head-wrap and a single pheasant tail feather standing erect at the forefront of this headdress. Joseph could distinguish some sort of conversation happening, the words too quiet to make out. For several tense seconds he, Marie, his classmates and his professor waited for what would happen.What happened was that from this man, the villages hereditary chief, the order was given for them to be spared... for now. Another order was given to separate them and hold them in isolation until a final decision could be made.As Joseph was carried away into a side street, he could almost glimpse Marie following the palanquin into the Temple, including his Professor, still sitting in his basket.Several Hours LaterJoseph could never fully recall all of the things that he had pondered in those hours, sitting with his hands and feet bound, alone in that dark storehouse, smelling of rice and preserved vegetables. He had found Marie and as he had suspected for a number of years, she apparently belonged to a semi-unique culture of Vietic speakers in her purported homeland of the Annamite Range. What came as a surprise was that they apparently, if the few bits of coherent speech he had heard were any indication, practiced some sort of ritualized homicide and may well be inclined toward the consumption of \"long pork\"... and at the moment, that could include him.Eventually the door opened and soft, yellow light flooded the room, illuminating bags of rice and strings of hanging vegetables. In the doorway was Marie, carrying a paper covered lantern in one hand, a bronze bowl in the other and now hat-less. As he had briefly noticed earlier, the muscles on her limbs now had a definition to them that hadnt existed back in Glaston, her frame slightly more lean than the apprentice cook that he remembered. She was dressed just as she had been before, was still tattooed everywhere he could see and, as she she came over to where he was sitting, the light in the lantern seemed more like... fireflies than any kind of flame.\"So... nice place you have here.\" He hoped that starting slow could take some of the edge off the dangerous situation in which he now faced himself.\"Yeah... it is nice, I guess.\" Marie put the bowl (now seen to be carrying water) and the lantern on the ground beside him and knelt to untie his bonds. \"Im sorry that you got dragged into this. When I borrowed that record... I had no idea that...\" She closed her eyes and sighed in a way that, to Joseph, made the tattoos on her face dance almost... alluringly. \"Theres a lot that I just couldnt tell you when we were younger. My people are used to hiding... maybe tooused to it by now. I want to tell you so much, but I... I dont know where to begin.\"\"Then start from the beginning. That always seems to be how its done in the movies.\" Rubbing his wrists and ankles to get the circulation back, Joseph wondered just what he was going to hear.What he heard was everythingabout her people, the stories she had enraptured Cora with plus a whole lot of other stuff, fantastic and gruesome in equal measure. The human sacrifice, the ritual cannibalism, the intermittent persecution by Chinese, Champa, Viet and French over the last two thousand years... nothing was left out. As he sipped water from the bowl, she described how her peoples ancestors had been Au Lac refugees from the Red River Valley, driven south into the mountains by the invading Qin Chinese. On the edge of total starvation, they had been saved when a spirit animal, a black water buffalo cow with a seemingly endless number of calves trailing behind, had emerged from the highland jungle at the chanting of animist shamans travelling with the group.Behind those spectral buffalo had emerged their wonder and salvation: men in red robes with the legs of goats, monks from a far, high land called Leng. These strange people, who called themselves Shugoran, had taught this diverse group of farmers, mountain peoples, priests, urbanites and servants many useful magics: how to grow up to twelve crops of rice per year, how to draw water and metal from the earth, how to commune with the forces of the universe and not annoy them too severely, how to pass perfect memories from father to son, how to ensure the fertility of people, livestock and game and how to armor a persons skin so as to stop any blade or spear or arrow or sling stone.It was this last spell, combined with the requirement in orthodox Shugoran magic for Human (or similar) sacrifice and cannibalism that brought on the next mess. When the Qin Dynasty collapsed under the weight of the first emperors paranoia and his successors incompetence, suicide and the resultant power struggle, the men of the new \"Leng Viet\" decided to press their advantage. They launched a guerrilla campaign in an attempt to drive the Trieu Dynasty, with its mixed nobility of native southerners and Han Chinese, out of the Red River valley and establish a new native state.Over the next hundred years, men raided trade routes and army barracks in the guise of screaming, bare-chested, tattooed (associated with bandits and convicts by the Chinese) savages, dragging captives off into the night or the forest in order to sacrifice them for either civilian or military magic. When they eventually lost their \"War of the Bandits\" (from the threefold causes of not getting any local nobility on their side, of terrifying the pants off their Viet kinsmen with their ferocity and the rumours of their religion and by the sheer weight of the eventual re-invasion by the armies of the Han Dynasty) they fled deep into the mountains of the West and South, being chided by the last of the original, goat-legged sorcerers for their foolish, ill-planned ambitions. From then, they had remained hidden and relatively peaceful, though remembered in whispered folk-tales as vicious, man-eating monsters.After Marie had finished. Joseph sat in silence for a few minutes, digesting what he had just heard. The whole thing about magic was a bit.. hard to swallow. However, his own eyes had seen things that most would say were impossible. \"You dont... you dont hate me now, do you?\" Marie suddenly asked, her face awash in a worried panic, perhaps the culmination of every bout of anxiety she had ever experienced when Joseph had began edging onto the subject of her peoples true nature. So much worry, so much fear and one wrong move now could break her heart.For once, just once, he initiated the kiss this time.\"Does that answer your question?\" As they pulled apart, he could see that most of her anxieties had melted away. \"And... I hesitate to mention this, but about your parents restaurant...\" He stopped when he saw her face, now an annoyed, knowing grimace that indicated that the next words out of his mouth should be chosen very carefully. \"Uh... about the chicken, beef and pork they used. Was any of it... officiallysacrificed?\"Maries grimace let up. \"You need a priest to do anything official, and my parents are from farming families. Dont worry, we never served anyone up as the main course.\" She actually began to smile as she stood upright.\"Alright... but speaking of the main course, what about...\" Joseph gulped nervously. \"Me? Am I still going to be barbecue or did you actually convince anyone otherwise?\"The next news out of Maries mouth was welcome indeed. \"I didnt, but your professor won your life and those of the others after he talked with our Chief Priest. If Im right, he and the rest of your team should be at the house of my paternal grandparents. Who arethey, anyway?\"\"My classmates. The Anthropology department at Miskatonic organized this trip with Professor Andover and a couple of us volunteered. \" Still holding the bowl, Joseph began standing, his limbs still stiff and numb from hours of sitting. Despite this discomfort and the twitching shocks that came when blood began flowing free again, he followed her out the door, though not before taking and slinging a bag of rice over his shoulder at her asking, along with a braid of garlic bulbs and a small box of dried pork on a cord.During his captivity, Joseph had been held in one of the storehouses by the river, a short way north of the village. Now, in the waning light of dusk, he and Marie made their way back on the path that wove through vegetable gardens and pig-pens until they reached the outlying houses. Through narrow alleys between house stilts and below the sounds of evening meals being eaten, past dogs and pigs drowsing in the under-crofts and along the great outer wall of the temple they traveled before moving into the main square and down the main thoroughfare.\"It should be just after this next left, right across from the bronze-smith.\" As they walked along, they came to an intersection. On their right was a large house facing the street, belonging to the village bronze-smith and acting as a shop, a workplace and his family home. Across the main street from that house was a side street, lined by mostly smaller houses but each of them with soft lights in their windows. A few houses in, Marie led Joseph up the stairs of one house where familiar voices were laughing and making merry, including one brash female voice in particular that Joseph had come to know well.As Marie lay down the lantern on the porch and opened the door, the voices became louder and clearer. When they entered, everyone was already seated (or at least kneeling). Albert and Malone were trading stories of their brief imprisonment and what they had seen, while Tracy was working her way through a bowl of green tea, apparently trying to cajole her way into the rice whiskey. Professor Andover was making small conversation with an old village man sitting at the head of the table who was wearing the brown jacket and skirt combo that was so common. Also at the table was a younger man and his wife, maybe a little older than Maries parents, along with two teenage sons who had not yet received their tattooing. Some ways from the table, an elderly woman worked at a hearth lined with stone and brick, stoking a carefully controlled charcoal fire.Everyone looked up at the new arrivals. The first to speak was the old man who had been talking to the professor, telling Marie to bring the rice and other ingredients over to the charcoal hearth so the evening meal could begin and then for them to sit down. After that was done, Joseph noticed that people were looking at him.Apparently, it was time to make introductions.\"Joseph, Id like you to meet my family on my fathers side.\" After explaining that few of them could understand any English at all, Marie started introducing them. First came the old man, now identified as her paternal grandfather. Her grandmother, his wife, was the woman starting tending the fire at the hearth, her gray hair in an elaborate bun at the back of the head held together with a set of jade hairpins and wearing a long, black dress, similar to the garment that Marie had worn at the performance. Maries uncle Huy and his wife An sat across from the Miskatonic students and beside them sat Cuong and Thao, their two sons...Only two?\"Damn, the Kids!\" Marie had been so busy with her boyfriend that the absence her younger cousins had escaped her until now. She got back up and went to the door, opened it and called down the street for them to get in the house now and try not to spill the water they were carrying. As she returned to where she had been kneeling, many hurried footsteps were heard coming up the outside stairs and the door opened again as five children entered as a crowd. The oldest, a girl who was perhaps eleven years old, was carrying two bronze pails of water in her hands while the second oldest, a boy of maybe ten, was carrying two more.In fact, all the kids, which included two more boys and another girl, seemed to each be about a year apart down to a little boy of about seven years old. \"Big families the norm around here?\" Joseph asked his girlfriend as the water was transferred to cooking vessels and the ingredients collected.Marie shrugged. \"More or less: most farming families have at least three kids nowadays but the norm used to be around five around a century ago. This family is weird both ways: My uncle and aunt for having so many and my parents for just having me.\" Of course, sooner or later this casual reminiscing had to end. \"So, Professor...\" Tracy began, consciously deciding to get back on topic from the revery the two had been involved in. \"You Said that you had something to tell us, about the ultimate purpose of this expedition?\"Neville Andover smiled the way that someone delivering a great and terrible revelation does. \"As a matter of fact, I did.\" He motioned towards Malone, who was now extremely attentive. \"This is Malone Roberts; for the last year he has been playing the part of my student, but he is far more than that. He is my assistant, my cohort... my protege in the context of the agency I work for. Tell me...\" He seemed to direct this as every member of the audience (save Malone) who could speak English. \"Have any of you heard of Delta Green?\"\"Whats that? Something in the Marine Corps?\" It had soundedlike an innocent question from Ms. Williams, but Joseph had shared a class, study groups and cram sessions with her for many months, and could recognize the first signs of building stress and panic when he saw them. They were amazingly similar to the signs that Marie herself had shown, with the difference of gripping objects such as a table edge with white-knuckle intensity now apparent.\"Its surprising that you havent heard of it, considering the contacts in your community and the agencies reputation for... extreme measuresbefore 1960.\" Now Andover turned to Albert Noyes. \"Perhaps you have some notion of it... or its partner agency, Majestic 12. It is quite amazing work theyre doing on the Yuggoth Project, especially on fungi.\" This seemed like it was crammed with potential clues, but honestly, Joseph couldnt make heads or tails of it.Noyes, on the other hand, apparently could. He began smiling in surprise and recognition and began laughing at the revelation. \"You mean... you know about the Migo?\" Now Joseph was confused beyond all reckoning, and apparently so were Marie and Tracy.\"Know aboutthem, know some of them, occasionally work alongside them. And if I may say, for half-fungus, half-arthropod, telepathic pains in the rear, they are remarkably easy to work with.\" What followed was Albert explaining the situation: the weirdest kinds of aliens you could imagine had contacted some humans in the 1800s and hired them to assist in mining certain valuable minerals in the hills of Vermont and Maine. Over the years, the men and women in their employ had received advice from these aliens as to potential marriage partners, first in terms genetic compatibility and superior traits for their offspring, then based on attractiveness as their understanding of human reproductive psychology increased. Finally, as they realized the subtle psychological and social rules of courtship, the began acting as human elites once did, organizing parties for unattached men and women and subtly directing candidates certain ways as they piloted artificial human body-shells around the dance floor. It sounded weird... but reassuring, even humorous. Even Tracy seemed to lighten up... as far as a hunted rabbit couldlighten up.\"Mr. Clayton here is what you may call normal. However, he was privy to manifestations not usual of this Earth.\" Joseph then told the assembled of what he had witnessed, with Professor Andover hypothesizing that the phonograph may have projected images and smells by some means of eldritch energies. Marie also retold the story of her people and of the deal that she had agreed to to gain access to the phonograph: one year back in the village and receiving her tattoos of adulthood. Nothing more and nothing less had been asked of her.\"And finally, we have Ms. Williams, whose tale has much to do with the founding of the organization and its present form.\" Here, Andover seemed to realize what kind of anxiety the girl was going through, and thus went slowly. \"In the winter of 1928, the Miskatonic faculty was contacted by the United States Army to help investigate a series of strange attacks and abductions in Paige County, Virginia. As the base was in a primarily Quaker area, Miskatonic sent its lone member of faculty who was a Friend, one Hiriam Willows of Boston. While he remained among the Quaker farmfolk who knew the habits of the attacks, the army waged war against what was first believed to be a \"degenerate\" tribe of Iroquois but were later found to be white members of a strange fertility cult which engaged in human sacrifice.\"The academic glanced towards Tracy, who had lowered her head, closed her eyes and grimaced at what was surely to come. He turned back to his eager listeners. \"Before Willows left, he discovered strange objects in a secret room at the Longhouse Meeting Hall... objects which resembled those found on the slain cultists. He also, inadvertently, stumbled upon his hosts engaged in a ritual of apparent mourning, dressed as the Southern Iroquois would have been three hundred years ago, sacrificing pigs upon an altar at an isolated circle of standing stones, wailing and keening in grief.\" He looked back at Tracy. \"This was the experience which convinced him that not all who worship the base forces of the universe are driven to evil nor insanity. It was also the experience that not all things should be released to the world, both for the worlds safety and that of the subjects.\"After a moments silence, Tracy spoke. \"Excuse me.\" She got up walked out the door, somewhat to the surprise of her classmates, Marie and Maries family. Marie then got up and went to follow, an act which inevitably drew Joseph after her.They found Tracy sitting at the bottom of the steps, her chin on one balled fist, her other arm across her lap, her eyes staring into some unfathomable distance. Marie went forward first, sitting beside the girl as Joseph hung back. \"I dont think weve been introduced. My names Marie.\" When Tracy didnt answer. \"You know, you dont have to feel bad about what other people did. Those guys the Army killed werent your people, no matter how similar your rituals may have been.\"\"But they weremy people.\" The answer came suddenly and surprised both listeners.\"Pardon?\" Asked Joseph from the middle of the stairway.\"Those dangerous cultists that the professor told you about; they were English, Quakers even... or had been at one time.\" She sighed, not quite sure of herself on how to explain to outsiders the issue which had plagued her fears since the age of 10. \"They were my peoples kin, descendants of those of us who answered the Union armies call for guerrillas during the Civil War. Before that, wed adopted some sacrificial ritual from the Iroquois during the 1720s after some very hard winters. Where before theyd killed dogs, black deer and captured warriors... as well as captured women and children if it got reallybad... to get good crops and health, we imposed strict limits and rules. There was to be no more human sacrifice, we killed our own livestock and above all, we accept the rituals as a gift from on high... even if the whole Christ thing was supposed to render sacrifice obsolete.\"\"Id consider it a divine door prize. But about the Civil War?\" Marie was trying to make the talk as nonthreatening as possible, considering the darkness which had settled over the village.Getting back on topic, Tracy continued. \"Well, wed already been hiding escaped slaves for years on their way up to the major escape routes in Pennsylvania, but we felt that we couldnt do any more, especially with so much Confederate presence in the Shenandoah and the internecine aggression over secession. These people though... they wanted to do something. So, when a few Union officers wanted a meeting, they snuck off north. And when they came back, they brought otherthings with them. Old medieval codices which described Druidic rituals shockingly similar to our own but twisted and brutal, rituals which needed terror to be inflicted in the victims so that the full power of their life force could be drained. Their attitudes had changed as well; they became disdainful of the rest of the community: calling them weak, cowards, savages who refused to possess the full power of the Star Daughter and the Black Stag, fools who held onto their petty delusions of morality. Well, after they went and made a mess of everything by capturing and sacrificing a Confederate squadron... the rest of the Longhouse Quakers shunned them, bidding them to go into the high mountains until they were ready to return. And so, a collection of about 50 men, women and children left the Valley and went into the high woods.\"Joseph put something together in his head. \"And I take it that the next time they returned was 60 years later, crazier than ever.\"Tracy harrumphed. \"Youve got that right. And think about this while youre at it: by the 1920s, wed been isolated for so long that it was starting to show in our features; the more inbred we became, the leaner our faces and the bonier our joints. By the time Willows got there, we just looked skinny and somewhat malnourished and with the right connections a few decades later, that began to get fixed.\" Her face got hard. \"But what if Willows had finked on us, or Miskatonic sent one of their Congregationalist mamas boys instead? Do you realize what may have happened to us, especially in the 20s or 30s? Arresting us for a start, probably followed by forced sterilization and throwing us in crazy houses, sanitariums and prisons to rot. And thats just the adults!\"She was getting visibly angry. \"Their kids, my great-grandparents, would have been shuffled off to orphanages or perhaps boarding schools if they thought we were just really pale Indians.\" She shuddered. \"Ive read about the shit that happened in Canadas residential school system and it gave me just as many nightmares as the thought of my ancestors being hunted like wolves and tortured for things they never did or for who they were.\" She turned to look at Marie and for the first time since he knew her, Joseph could put a name (that name being \"very mildly inbred\") on the features which he had labeled as rural-attractive or cute in a farmers daughter kind of way. \"I know that your people have been hiding, but at least you guys made the mistake of acting like total jerks to get your reputation! We never did anything wrong.\"With that, Tracy got up, passed her companions and just as she was about to reenter the house, she paused and rethought something. \"Well, never did anything wrong besides burning down that chicken barn, but that was an emergency! Neither my aunt nor my little cousin would be here if not for that and besides...\" She turned her head to look at Joseph and Marie. \"They wrote it off as an electrical fire.\" As Tracy went back into the house, Joseph thought that, while going against all conventional reason, his life made perfect sense for the first time in a very long while."]}
{"id": "EN078", "pair": ["The world we live in is not as it seems. I, James White, write this document so that others may be made aware of what I have experienced and know of the dangers that lurk beneath our limited perception of \"reality\". Whether you believe me or not, dear reader, is up to you. I only ask that you read what I write with an open mind since I write, not for my own gain, but to warn you of what I can only describe as \"pure evil\".I had never heard of the \"Cult of Cthulhu\" before I began university in the late summer of 2012. I was only eighteen years old, an atheist, and dogmatically pursued scientific understanding and knowledge. At that time, I was not in the least bit interested in weird cults and other religious movements, which I simply dismissed as primitive superstition. Had I but known what I would encounter, I would have burnt the science textbook, prayed to God for the strength not to crumble into insanity and got as far away from that university as I could!The strange happenings started less than two months into my first term. I had been put into student accommodation and shared a corridor with four other boys and two girls. I had got to know my flatmates very well until all of a sudden, one of the boys by the name of Jonathan Mears disappeared. This wasnt looked upon as weird at first since Jonathan was the quiet type anyway and often spent long hours alone in his room. The suspicions arose however, when he hadnt shown his face for three days. His absence was brought up one evening as we sat in a communal area.\"Hes probably just been very busy lately,\" my best friend, Jacob Shields, said. \"You know Jonathan. When he sets his mind on something, he doesnt stop until hes achieved whatever hes trying to do.\"\"Isnt it a bit strange though?\" Annie Roberts, a lovely blonde girl from the room directly across the corridor asked. \"I mean, hes in our corridor and we havent seen him for ages. Not even in the kitchen or lecture halls.\"\"It isnt like him to miss a lecture,\" I agreed. Jacob merely waved these concerns away.\"If we havent seen him by tomorrow evening, well go to the reception and see whats happening,\" he said cheerfully.But Jonathan didnt show up the following day and, as planned, my entire corridor went to the reception desk to ask if anything had happened to him. The receptionist, an elderly lady, checked through the files on a computer before looking up at us.\"Im afraid he has left the university,\" she informed us. \"He dropped out four days ago.\"\"Well there you go!\" Jacob exclaimed. \"Nothing to worry about!\"But there was something to worry about. Even though I now had every reason to think that Jonathan was fine, I couldnt shake that feeling of foreboding. He had seemed happy in university and was consistently getting high marks so I resolved to check things out for myself.I waited until 3:00 the following morning, and in the darkness, I tiptoed along the corridor to Jonathans room. Using a paperclip, I carefully picked the lock on his door and let myself in. I closed the door behind me and switched on the light. The sight that greeted me came as a huge shock. Clothes still lay on the floor, the bed was made, books were still on the shelves and a laptop was still humming gently on the cluttered desk. In short, it looked as though Jonathan was simply out of the room. If he had gone home, why did he leave all his things behind? And if he hadnt, where was he and why did the university records state that he had? Deeply concerned, I left the room and returned to my own. I lay awake in the darkness pondering the thoughts in my head and finally decided that I needed to find out what had happened and that I would do so alone...", "I didnt stop running until I had burst into my room, locked the door behind me and placed a chair under the handle. Then I immediately vomited into the bin before collapsing onto my bed in floods of tears. I couldnt quite believe what I had seen that evening; it was too terrible to comprehend. But worse was to come.Although I so desperately wanted to sleep, I forced myself not to. Instead I sat shivering with fear in the corner of the room, expecting Jacob and Annie to attempt to enter the room any second. I had to get out of here, I had to go to the police, I had to do something. And I had to stay awake. I had to...And then I was no longer in my room. In contrast, I was standing amidst vast structures of black stone. On each stone was etched hieroglyphics of the kind I had never before seen and they were all covered in a sticky green goo. These stones seemed to go on for miles, their geometry extremely strange and disturbing. I must be dreaming, I told myself, this cant be real. Yet even in this knowledge, the sheer terror of the place engulfed me. I began to walk slowly around the structures, being careful not to touch the slime on their surface and desperately trying to wake up. And then I saw it, the monster of the notebook and the diabolical ritual. But this time, it wasnt a picture or statue but an enormous living monstrosity. I was rooted to the ground in fear as I stared at its huge form that seemed to tower for miles above me, its green, scaly skin, its thick leathery wings and its octopus-like tentacles, and from out of the air I heard the disembodied chant, \"Cthulhu Fhtagn! Cthulhu Fhtagn!\" I was still unable to run and the tentacles of the monster began to rap themselves around me, all the while that demonic chant getting louder and louder until it felt like my head was being crushed. I was raised off the ground and brought up to the monsters head. It looked at me with one of its evil red eyes the fear became too much. I began to scream hysterically, writhing around in the grip of the beast. And then I awoke, breathing heavily and sweating profusely. I was lying on the floor and just remained there for a while, staring into the darkness and reminiscing on the terrors of the dream and the ritual I had seen, and remembering that chant: \"Cthulhu Fhtagn!\" What did it all mean?The following day, I did not attend lectures and only left the room once to grab some food. As fate would have it, during this brief moment out of solitude, I met the person I didnt want to see ever again, Jacob. I avoided his gaze as he looked at me enquiringly.\"We missed you in lectures today,\" he said curiously. I didnt answer. I was sure he had seen me last night. \"Where were you?\" Jacob asked. Again, I was silent. He laid a hand on my shoulder. \"Is something wrong, James?\" It was then that I looked into his eyes but instead of the evil I had expected to see, all I could make out was concern.\"No,\" I muttered in reply.\"Something is wrong,\" Jacob disagreed. \"Whats up?\" Either hes a very good actor, or hes entirely genuine, I thought to myself. And if was being genuine, that must mean that either he didnt remember the ritual I had seen him participating in or that I had only been dreaming. I prayed it was the latter.\"Im ok,\" I said, giving him the benefit of the doubt. \"Im just feeling a little unwell, thats all.\"\"Well look after yourself,\" he replied without a trace of ingenuity. I quickly made myself a ham sandwich and once again locked myself into my room. The thoughts that raced around inside my head were endless as I casually bit into the sandwich. Almost immediately, I spat the contents out of my mouth, screamed and vomited onto the floor. What was inside the sandwich was not the ham I had put in but a vile mixture of the green goo I had seen in my \"dream\" and human blood. The room started spinning around me, turning into a dark green, and images of the tentacled creature I had seen so much of lately started appearing in every corner. I covered my ears and screamed uncontrollably.And then Jacob and Annie were in front of me. I had no idea where they had come from for I had locked the door. But I was anywhere but the comfort of my room. Instead, I was in some sort of other realm, my room rapidly beginning to fade.\"You shouldnt have got involved in this,\" Jacob whispered menacingly.\"Now you must pay.\" Annie cooed.\"In his house at Rlyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.\" they said in unison. And then I saw no more."]}
{"id": "EN034", "pair": ["II. An Antecedent and a Horror1.Joseph Curwen, as revealed by the rambling legends embodied in what Ward heard and unearthed, was a very astonishing, enigmatic, and obscurely horrible individual. He had fled from Salem to Providence - that universal haven of the odd, the free, and the dissenting - at the beginning of the great witchcraft panic; being in fear of accusation because of his solitary ways and queer chemical or alchemical experiments. He was a colourless-looking man of about thirty, and was soon found qualified to become a freeman of Providence; thereafter buying a home lot just north of Gregory Dexters at about the foot of Olney Street. His house was built on Stampers Hill west of the Town Street, in what later became Olney Court; and in 1761 he replaced this with a larger one, on the same site, which is still standing.      Now the first odd thing about Joseph Curwen was that he did not seem to grow much older than he had been on his arrival. He engaged in shipping enterprises, purchased wharfage near Mile-End Cove, helped rebuild the Great Bridge in 1713, and in 1723 was one of the founders of the Congregational Church on the hill; but always did he retain the nondescript aspect of a man not greatly over thirty or thirty-five. As decades mounted up, this singular quality began to excite wide notice; but Curwen always explained it by saying that he came of hardy forefathers, and practiced a simplicity of living which did not wear him out. How such simplicity could be reconciled with the inexplicable comings and goings of the secretive merchant, and with the queer gleaming of his windows at all hours of night, was not very clear to the townsfolk; and they were prone to assign other reasons for his continued youth and longevity. It was held, for the most part, that Curwens incessant mixings and boilings of chemicals had much to do with his condition. Gossip spoke of the strange substances he brought from London and the Indies on his ships or purchased in Newport, Boston, and New York; and when old Dr. Jabez Bowen came from Rehoboth and opened his apothecary shop across the Great Bridge at the Sign of the Unicorn and Mortar, there was ceaseless talk of the drugs, acids, and metals that the taciturn recluse incessantly bought or ordered from him. Acting on the assumption that Curwen possessed a wondrous and secret medical skill, many sufferers of various sorts applied to him for aid; but though he appeared to encourage their belief in a non-committal way, and always gave them odd-coloured potions in response to their requests, it was observed that his ministrations to others seldom proved of benefit. At length, when over fifty years had passed since the strangers advent, and without producing more than five years apparent change in his face and physique, the people began to whisper more darkly; and to meet more than half way that desire for isolation which he had always shewn.      Private letters and diaries of the period reveal, too, a multitude of other reasons why Joseph Curwen was marvelled at, feared, and finally shunned like a plague. His passion for graveyards, in which he was glimpsed at all hours and under all conditions, was notorious; though no one had witnessed any deed on his part which could actually be termed ghoulish. On the Pawtuxet Road he had a farm, at which he generally lived during the summer, and to which he would frequently be seen riding at various odd times of the day or night. Here his only visible servants, farmers, and caretakers were a sullen pair of aged Narragansett Indians; the husband dumb and curiously scarred, and the wife of a very repulsive cast of countenance, probably due to a mixture of negro blood. In the lean-to of this house was the laboratory where most of the chemical experiments were conducted. Curious porters and teamers who delivered bottles, bags, or boxes at the small rear door would exchange accounts of the fantastic flasks, crucibles, alembics, and furnaces they saw in the low shelved room; and prophesied in whispers that the close-mouthed \"chymist\" - by which they meant alchemist - would not be long in finding the Philosophers Stone. The nearest neighbours to this farm - the Fenners, a quarter of a mile away - had still queerer things to tell of certain sounds which they insisted came from the Curwen place in the night. There were cries, they said, and sustained howlings; and they did not like the large number of livestock which thronged the pastures, for no such amount was needed to keep a lone old man and a very few servants in meat, milk, and wool. The identity of the stock seemed to change from week to week as new droves were purchased from the Kingstown farmers. Then, too, there was something very obnoxious about a certain great stone outbuilding with only high narrow slits for windows.      Great Bridge idlers likewise had much to say of Curwens town house in Olney Court; not so much the fine new one built in 1761, when the man must have been nearly a century old, but the first low gambrel-roofed one with the windowless attic and shingled sides, whose timbers he took the peculiar precaution of burning after its demolition. Here there was less mystery, it is true; but the hours at which lights were seen, the secretiveness of the two swarthy foreigners who comprised the only menservants, the hideous indistinct mumbling of the incredibly aged French housekeeper, the large amounts of food seen to enter a door within which only four persons lived, and the quality of certain voices often heard in muffled conversation at highly unseasonable times, all combined with what was known of the Pawtuxet farm to give the place a bad name.      In choicer circles, too, the Curwen home was by no means undiscussed; for as the newcomer had gradually worked into the church and trading life of the town, he had naturally made acquaintances of the better sort, whose company and conversation he was well fitted by education to enjoy. His birth was known to be good, since the Curwens or Corwins of Salem needed no introduction in New England. It developed that Joseph Curwen had travelled much in very early life, living for a time in England and making at least two voyages to the Orient; and his speech, when he deigned to use it, was that of a learned and cultivated Englishman. But for some reason or other Curwen did not care for society. Whilst never actually rebuffing a visitor, he always reared such a wall of reserve that few could think of anything to say to him which would not sound inane.      There seemed to lurk in his bearing some cryptic, sardonic arrogance, as if he had come to find all human beings dull through having moved among stranger and more potent entities. When Dr. Checkley the famous wit came from Boston in 1738 to be rector of Kings Church, he did not neglect calling on one of whom he soon heard so much; but left in a very short while because of some sinister undercurrent he detected in his hosts discourse. Charles Ward told his father, when they discussed Curwen one winter evening, that he would give much to learn what the mysterious old man had said to the sprightly cleric, but that all diarists agree concerning Dr. Checkleys reluctance to repeat anything he had heard. The good man had been hideously shocked, and could never recall Joseph Curwen without a visible loss of the gay urbanity for which he was famed.      More definite, however, was the reason why another man of taste and breeding avoided the haughty hermit. In 1746 Mr. John Merritt, an elderly English gentleman of literary and scientific leanings, came from Newport to the town which was so rapidly overtaking it in standing, and built a fine country seat on the Neck in what is now the heart of the best residence section. He lived in considerable style and comfort, keeping the first coach and liveried servants in town, and taking great pride in his telescope, his microscope, and his well-chosen library of English and Latin books. Hearing of Curwen as the owner of the best library in Providence, Mr. Merritt early paid him a call, and was more cordially received than most other callers at the house had been. His admiration for his hosts ample shelves, which besides the Greek, Latin, and English classics were equipped with a remarkable battery of philosophical, mathematical, and scientific works including Paracelsus, Agricola, Van Helmont, Sylvius, Glauber, Boyle, Boerhaave, Becher, and Stahl, led Curwen to suggest a visit to the farmhouse and laboratory whither he had never invited anyone before; and the two drove out at once in Mr. Merritts coach.      Mr. Merritt always confessed to seeing nothing really horrible at the farmhouse, but maintained that the titles of the books in the special library of thaumaturgical, alchemical, and theological subjects which Curwen kept in a front room were alone sufficient to inspire him with a lasting loathing. Perhaps, however, the facial expression of the owner in exhibiting them contributed much of the prejudice. The bizarre collection, besides a host of standard works which Mr. Merritt was not too alarmed to envy, embraced nearly all the cabbalists, daemonologists, and magicians known to man; and was a treasure-house of lore in the doubtful realms of alchemy and astrology. Hermes Trismegistus in Mesnards edition, the Turba Philosophorum, Gebers Liber Investigationis, and Artephius Key of Wisdom all were there; with the cabbalistic Zohar, Peter Jammys set of Albertus Magnus, Raymond Lullys Ars Magna et Ultima in Zetzners edition, Roger Bacons Thesaurus Chemicus, Fludds Clavis Alchimiae, and Trithemius De Lapide Philosophico crowding them close. Mediaeval Jews and Arabs were represented in profusion, and Mr. Merritt turned pale when, upon taking down a fine volume conspicuously labelled as the Qanoon-e-Islam, he found it was in truth the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred, of which he had heard such monstrous things whispered some years previously after the exposure of nameless rites at the strange little fishing village of Kingsport, in the Province of the Massachusetts-Bay.      But oddly enough, the worthy gentleman owned himself most impalpably disquieted by a mere minor detail. On the huge mahogany table there lay face downward a badly worn copy of Borellus, bearing many cryptical marginalia and interlineations in Curwens hand. The book was open at about its middle, and one paragraph displayed such thick and tremulous pen-strokes beneath the lines of mystic black-letter that the visitor could not resist scanning it through. Whether it was the nature of the passage underscored, or the feverish heaviness of the strokes which formed the underscoring, he could not tell; but something in that combination affected him very badly and very peculiarly. He recalled it to the end of his days, writing it down from memory in his diary and once trying to recite it to his close friend Dr. Checkley till he saw how greatly it disturbed the urbane rector. It read:      \"The essential Saltes of Animals may be so prepared and preserved, that an ingenious Man may have the whole Ark of Noah in his own Studie, and raise the fine Shape of an Animal out of its Ashes at his Pleasure; and by the lyke Method from the essential Saltes of humane Dust, a Philosopher may, without any criminal Necromancy, call up the Shape of any dead Ancestour from the Dust whereinto his Bodie has been incinerated.\"      It was near the docks along the southerly part of the Town Street, however, that the worst things were muttered about Joseph Curwen. Sailors are superstitious folk; and the seasoned salts who manned the infinite rum, slave, and molasses sloops, the rakish privateers, and the great brigs of the Browns, Crawfords, and Tillinghasts, all made strange furtive signs of protection when they saw the slim, deceptively young-looking figure with its yellow hair and slight stoop entering the Curwen warehouse in Doubloon Street or talking with captains and supercargoes on the long quay where the Curwen ships rode restlessly. Curwens own clerks and captains hated and feared him, and all his sailors were mongrel riff-raff from Martinique, St. Eustatius, Havana, or Port Royal. It was, in a way, the frequency with which these sailors were replaced which inspired the acutest and most tangible part of the fear in which the old man was held. A crew would be turned loose in the town on shore leave, some of its members perhaps charged with this errand or that; and when reassembled it would be almost sure to lack one or more men. That many of the errands had concerned the farm on the Pawtuxet Road, and that few of the sailors had ever been seen to return from that place, was not forgotten; so that in time it became exceedingly difficult for Curwen to keep his oddly assorted hands. Almost invariably several would desert soon after hearing the gossip of the Providence wharves, and their replacement in the West Indies became an increasingly great problem to the merchant.      In 1760 Joseph Curwen was virtually an outcast, suspected of vague horrors and daemoniac alliances which seemed all the more menacing because they could not be named, understood, or even proved to exist. The last straw may have come from the affair of the missing soldiers in 1758, for in March and April of that year two Royal regiments on their way to New France were quartered in Providence, and depleted by an inexplicable process far beyond the average rate of desertion. Rumour dwelt on the frequency with which Curwen was wont to be seen talking with the red-coated strangers; and as several of them began to be missed, people thought of the odd conditions among his own seamen. What would have happened if the regiments had not been ordered on, no one can tell.      Meanwhile the merchants worldly affairs were prospering. He had a virtual monopoly of the towns trade in saltpetre, black pepper, and cinnamon, and easily led any other one shipping establishment save the Browns in his importation of brassware, indigo, cotton, woollens, salt, rigging, iron, paper, and English goods of every kind. Such shopkeepers as James Green, at the Sign of the Elephant in Cheapside, the Russells, at the Sign of the Golden Eagle across the Bridge, or Clark and Nightingale at the Frying-Pan and Fish near the New Coffee-House, depended almost wholly upon him for their stock; and his arrangements with the local distillers, the Narragansett dairymen and horse-breeders, and the Newport candle-makers, made him one of the prime exporters of the Colony.      Ostracised though he was, he did not lack for civic spirit of a sort. When the Colony House burned down, he subscribed handsomely to the lotteries by which the new brick one - still standing at the head of its parade in the old main street - was built in 1761. In that same year, too, he helped rebuild the Great Bridge after the October gale. He replaced many of the books of the public library consumed in the Colony House fire, and bought heavily in the lottery that gave the muddy Market Parade and deep-rutted Town Street their pavement of great round stones with a brick footwalk or \"causey\" in the middle. About this time, also, he built the plain but excellent new house whose doorway is still such a triumph of carving. When the Whitefield adherents broke off from Dr. Cottons hill church in 1743 and founded Deacon Snows church across the Bridge, Curwen had gone with them; though his zeal and attendance soon abated. Now, however, he cultivated piety once more; as if to dispel the shadow which had thrown him into isolation and would soon begin to wreck his business fortunes if not sharply checked.2.      The sight of this strange, pallid man, hardly middle-aged in aspect yet certainly not less than a full century old, seeking at last to emerge from a cloud of fright and detestation too vague to pin down or analyse, was at once a pathetic, a dramatic, and a contemptible thing. Such is the power of wealth and of surface gestures, however, that there came indeed a slight abatement in the visible aversion displayed toward him; especially after the rapid disappearances of his sailors abruptly ceased. He must likewise have begun to practice an extreme care and secrecy in his graveyard expeditions, for he was never again caught at such wanderings; whilst the rumours of uncanny sounds and manoeuvres at his Pawtuxet farm diminished in proportion. His rate of food consumption and cattle replacement remained abnormally high; but not until modern times, when Charles Ward examined a set of his accounts and invoices in the Shepley Library, did it occur to any person - save one embittered youth, perhaps - to make dark comparisons between the large number of Guinea blacks he imported until 1766, and the disturbingly small number for whom he could produce bona fide bills of sale either to slave-dealers at the Great Bridge or to the planters of the Narragansett Country. Certainly, the cunning and ingenuity of this abhorred character were uncannily profound, once the necessity for their exercise had become impressed upon him.      But of course the effect of all this belated mending was necessarily slight. Curwen continued to be avoided and distrusted, as indeed the one fact of his continued air of youth at a great age would have been enough to warrant; and he could see that in the end his fortunes would be likely to suffer. His elaborate studies and experiments, whatever they may have been, apparently required a heavy income for their maintenance; and since a change of environment would deprive him of the trading advantages he had gained, it would not have profited him to begin anew in a different region just then. Judgment demanded that he patch up his relations with the townsfolk of Providence, so that his presence might no longer be a signal for hushed conversation, transparent excuses of errands elsewhere, and a general atmosphere of constraint and uneasiness. His clerks, being now reduced to the shiftless and impecunious residue whom no one else would employ, were giving him much worry; and he held to his sea-captains and mates only by shrewdness in gaining some kind of ascendancy over them - a mortgage, a promissory note, or a bit of information very pertinent to their welfare. In many cases, diarists have recorded with some awe, Curwen shewed almost the power of a wizard in unearthing family secrets for questionable use. During the final five years of his life it seemed as though only direct talks with the long-dead could possibly have furnished some of the data which he had so glibly at his tongues end.      About this time the crafty scholar hit upon a last desperate expedient to regain his footing in the community. Hitherto a complete hermit, he now determined to contract an advantageous marriage; securing as a bride some lady whose unquestioned position would make all ostracism of his home impossible. It may be that he also had deeper reasons for wishing an alliance; reasons so far outside the known cosmic sphere that only papers found a century and a half after his death caused anyone to suspect them; but of this nothing certain can ever be learned. Naturally he was aware of the horror and indignation with which any ordinary courtship of his would be received, hence he looked about for some likely candidate upon whose parents he might exert a suitable pressure. Such candidates, he found, were not at all easy to discover; since he had very particular requirements in the way of beauty, accomplishments, and social security. At length his survey narrowed down to the household of one of his best and oldest ship-captains, a widower of high birth and unblemished standing named Dutee Tillinghast, whose only daughter Eliza seemed dowered with every conceivable advantage save prospects as an heiress. Capt. Tillinghast was completely under the domination of Curwen; and consented, after a terrible interview in his cupolaed house on Powers Lane hill, to sanction the blasphemous alliance.      Eliza Tillinghast was at that time eighteen years of age, and had been reared as gently as the reduced circumstances of her father permitted. She had attended Stephen Jacksons school opposite the Court-House Parade; and had been diligently instructed by her mother, before the latters death of smallpox in 1757, in all the arts and refinements of domestic life. A sampler of hers, worked in 1753 at the age of nine, may still be found in the rooms of the Rhode Island Historical Society. After her mothers death she had kept the house, aided only by one old black woman. Her arguments with her father concerning the proposed Curwen marriage must have been painful indeed; but of these we have no record. Certain it is that her engagement to young Ezra Weeden, second mate of the Crawford packet Enterprise, was dutifully broken off, and that her union with Joseph Curwen took place on the seventh of March, 1763, in the Baptist church, in the presence of one of the most distinguished assemblages which the town could boast; the ceremony being performed by the younger Samuel Winsor. The Gazette mentioned the event very briefly, and in most surviving copies the item in question seems to be cut or torn out. Ward found a single intact copy after much search in the archives of a private collector of note, observing with amusement the meaningless urbanity of the language:      \"Monday evening last, Mr. Joseph Curwen, of this Town, Merchant, was married to Miss Eliza Tillinghast, Daughter of Capt. Dutee Tillinghast, a young Lady who has real Merit, added to a beautiful Person, to grace the connubial State and perpetuate its Felicity.\"      The collection of Durfee-Arnold letters, discovered by Charles Ward shortly before his first reputed madness in the private collection of Melville F. Peters, Esq., of George St., and covering this and a somewhat antecedent period, throws vivid light on the outrage done to public sentiment by this ill-assorted match. The social influence of the Tillinghasts, however, was not to be denied; and once more Joseph Curwen found his house frequented by persons whom he could never otherwise have induced to cross his threshold. His acceptance was by no means complete, and his bride was socially the sufferer through her forced venture; but at all events the wall of utter ostracism was somewhat worn down. In his treatment of his wife the strange bridegroom astonished both her and the community by displaying an extreme graciousness and consideration. The new house in Olney Court was now wholly free from disturbing manifestations, and although Curwen was much absent at the Pawtuxet farm which his wife never visited, he seemed more like a normal citizen than at any other time in his long years of residence. Only one person remained in open enmity with him, this being the youthful ships officer whose engagement to Eliza Tillinghast had been so abruptly broken. Ezra Weeden had frankly vowed vengeance; and though of a quiet and ordinarily mild disposition, was now gaining a hate-bred, dogged purpose which boded no good to the usurping husband.      On the seventh of May, 1765, Curwens only child Ann was born; and was christened by the Rev. John Graves of Kings Church, of which both husband and wife had become communicants shortly after their marriage, in order to compromise between their respective Congregational and Baptist affiliations. The record of this birth, as well as that of the marriage two years before, was stricken from most copies of the church and town annals where it ought to appear; and Charles Ward located both with the greatest difficulty after his discovery of the widows change of name had apprised him of his own relationship, and engendered the feverish interest which culminated in his madness. The birth entry, indeed, was found very curiously through correspondence with the heirs of the loyalist Dr. Graves, who had taken with him a duplicate set of records when he left his pastorate at the outbreak of the Revolution. Ward had tried this source because he knew that his great-great-grandmother Ann Tillinghast Potter had been an Episcopalian.      Shortly after the birth of his daughter, an event he seemed to welcome with a fervour greatly out of keeping with his usual coldness, Curwen resolved to sit for a portrait. This he had painted by a very gifted Scotsman named Cosmo Alexander, then a resident of Newport, and since famous as the early teacher of Gilbert Stuart. The likeness was said to have been executed on a wall-panel of the library of the house in Olney Court, but neither of the two old diaries mentioning it gave any hint of its ultimate disposition. At this period the erratic scholar shewed signs of unusual abstraction, and spent as much time as he possibly could at his farm on the Pawtuxet Road. He seemed, it was stated, in a condition of suppressed excitement or suspense; as if expecting some phenomenal thing or on the brink of some strange discovery. Chemistry or alchemy would appear to have played a great part, for he took from his house to the farm the greater number of his volumes on that subject.      His affectation of civic interest did not diminish, and he lost no opportunities for helping such leaders as Stephen Hopkins, Joseph Brown, and Benjamin West in their efforts to raise the cultural tone of the town, which was then much below the level of Newport in its patronage of the liberal arts. He had helped Daniel Jenckes found his bookshop in 1763, and was thereafter his best customer; extending aid likewise to the struggling Gazette that appeared each Wednesday at the Sign of Shakespears Head. In politics he ardently supported Governor Hopkins against the Ward party whose prime strength was in Newport, and his really eloquent speech at Hackers Hall in 1765 against the setting off of North Providence as a separate town with a pro-Ward vote in the General Assembly did more than any other one thing to wear down the prejudice against him. But Ezra Weeden, who watched him closely, sneered cynically at all this outward activity; and freely swore it was no more than a mask for some nameless traffick with the blackest gulfs of Tartarus. The revengeful youth began a systematic study of the man and his doings whenever he was in port; spending hours at night by the wharves with a dory in readiness when he saw lights in the Curwen warehouses, and following the small boat which would sometimes steal quietly off and down the bay. He also kept as close a watch as possible on the Pawtuxet farm, and was once severely bitten by the dogs the old Indian couple loosed upon him.3.      In 1766 came the final change in Joseph Curwen. It was very sudden, and gained wide notice amongst the curious townsfolk; for the air of suspense and expectancy dropped like an old cloak, giving instant place to an ill-concealed exaltation of perfect triumph. Curwen seemed to have difficulty in restraining himself from public harangues on what he had found or learned or made; but apparently the need of secrecy was greater than the longing to share his rejoicing, for no explanation was ever offered by him. It was after this transition, which appears to have come early in July, that the sinister scholar began to astonish people by his possession of information which only their long-dead ancestors would seem to be able to impart.      But Curwens feverish secret activities by no means ceased with this change. On the contrary, they tended rather to increase; so that more and more of his shipping business was handled by the captains whom he now bound to him by ties of fear as potent as those of bankruptcy had been. He altogether abandoned the slave trade, alleging that its profits were constantly decreasing. Every possible moment was spent at the Pawtuxet farm; though there were rumours now and then of his presence in places which, though not actually near graveyards, were yet so situated in relation to graveyards that thoughtful people wondered just how thorough the old merchants change of habits really was. Ezra Weeden, though his periods of espionage were necessarily brief and intermittent on account of his sea voyaging, had a vindictive persistence which the bulk of the practical townsfolk and farmers lacked; and subjected Curwens affairs to a scrutiny such as they had never had before.      Many of the odd manoeuvres of the strange merchants vessels had been taken for granted on account of the unrest of the times, when every colonist seemed determined to resist the provisions of the Sugar Act which hampered a prominent traffick. Smuggling and evasion were the rule in Narragansett Bay, and nocturnal landings of illicit cargoes were continuous commonplaces. But Weeden, night after night following the lighters or small sloops which he saw steal off from the Curwen warehouses at the Town Street docks, soon felt assured that it was not merely His Majestys armed ships which the sinister skulker was anxious to avoid. Prior to the change in 1766 these boats had for the most part contained chained negroes, who were carried down and across the bay and landed at an obscure point on the shore just north of Pawtuxet; being afterward driven up the bluff and across country to the Curwen farm, where they were locked in that enormous stone outbuilding which had only high narrow slits for windows. After that change, however, the whole programme was altered. Importation of slaves ceased at once, and for a time Curwen abandoned his midnight sailings. Then, about the spring of 1767, a new policy appeared. Once more the lighters grew wont to put out from the black, silent docks, and this time they would go down the bay some distance, perhaps as far as Namquit Point, where they would meet and receive cargo from strange ships of considerable size and widely varied appearance. Curwens sailors would then deposit this cargo at the usual point on the shore, and transport it overland to the farm; locking it in the same cryptical stone building which had formerly received the negroes. The cargo consisted almost wholly of boxes and cases, of which a large proportion were oblong and heavy and disturbingly suggestive of coffins.      Weeden always watched the farm with unremitting assiduity; visiting it each night for long periods, and seldom letting a week go by without a sight except when the ground bore a footprint-revealing snow. Even then he would often walk as close as possible in the travelled road or on the ice of the neighbouring river to see what tracks others might have left. Finding his own vigils interrupted by nautical duties, he hired a tavern companion named Eleazar Smith to continue the survey during his absences; and between them the two could have set in motion some extraordinary rumours. That they did not do so was only because they knew the effect of publicity would be to warn their quarry and make further progress impossible. Instead, they wished to learn something definite before taking any action. What they did learn must have been startling indeed, and Charles Ward spoke many times to his parents of his regret at Weedens later burning of his notebooks. All that can be told of their discoveries is what Eleazar Smith jotted down in a none too coherent diary, and what other diarists and letter-writers have timidly repeated from the statements which they finally made - and according to which the farm was only the outer shell of some vast and revolting menace, of a scope and depth too profound and intangible for more than shadowy comprehension.      It is gathered that Weeden and Smith became early convinced that a great series of tunnels and catacombs, inhabited by a very sizeable staff of persons besides the old Indian and his wife, underlay the farm. The house was an old peaked relic of the middle seventeenth century with enormous stack chimney and diamond-paned lattice windows, the laboratory being in a lean-to toward the north, where the roof came nearly to the ground. This building stood clear of any other; yet judging by the different voices heard at odd times within, it must have been accessible through secret passages beneath. These voices, before 1766, were mere mumblings and negro whisperings and frenzied screams, coupled with curious chants or invocations. After that date, however, they assumed a very singular and terrible cast as they ran the gamut betwixt dronings of dull acquiescence and explosions of frantic pain or fury, rumblings of conversation and whines of entreaty, pantings of eagerness and shouts of protest. They appeared to be in different languages, all known to Curwen, whose rasping accents were frequently distinguishable in reply, reproof, or threatening. Sometimes it seemed that several persons must be in the house; Curwen, certain captives, and the guards of those captives. There were voices of a sort that neither Weeden nor Smith had ever heard before despite their wide knowledge of foreign parts, and many that they did seem to place as belonging to this or that nationality. The nature of the conversations seemed always a kind of catechism, as if Curwen were extorting some sort of information from terrified or rebellious prisoners.      Weeden had many verbatim reports of overheard scraps in his notebook, for English, French, and Spanish, which he knew, were frequently used; but of these nothing has survived. He did, however, say that besides a few ghoulish dialogues in which the past affairs of Providence families were concerned, most of the questions and answers he could understand were historical or scientific; occasionally pertaining to very remote places and ages. Once, for example, an alternately raging and sullen figure was questioned in French about the Black Princes massacre at Limoges in 1370, as if there were some hidden reason which he ought to know. Curwen asked the prisoner - if prisoner it were - whether the order to slay was given because of the Sign of the Goat found on the altar in the ancient Roman crypt beneath the Cathedral, or whether the Dark Man of the Haute Vienne Coven had spoken the Three Words. Failing to obtain replies, the inquisitor had seemingly resorted to extreme means; for there was a terrific shriek followed by silence and muttering and a bumping sound.      None of these colloquies were ever ocularly witnessed, since the windows were always heavily draped. Once, though, during a discourse in an unknown tongue, a shadow was seen on the curtain which startled Weeden exceedingly; reminding him of one of the puppets in a show he had seen in the autumn of 1764 in Hackers Hall, when a man from Germantown, Pennsylvania, had given a clever mechanical spectacle advertised as a \"View of the Famous City of Jerusalem, in which are represented Jerusalem, the Temple of Solomon, his Royal Throne, the noted Towers, and Hills, likewise the Sufferings of Our Saviour from the Garden of Gethsemane to the Cross on the Hill of Golgotha; an artful piece of Statuary, Worthy to be seen by the Curious.\" It was on this occasion that the listener, who had crept close to the window of the front room whence the speaking proceeded, gave a start which roused the old Indian pair and caused them to loose the dogs on him. After that no more conversations were ever heard in the house, and Weeden and Smith concluded that Curwen had transferred his field of action to regions below.      That such regions in truth existed, seemed amply clear from many things. Faint cries and groans unmistakably came up now and then from what appeared to be the solid earth in places far from any structure; whilst hidden in the bushes along the river-bank in the rear, where the high ground sloped steeply down to the valley of the Pawtuxet, there was found an arched oaken door in a frame of heavy masonry, which was obviously an entrance to caverns within the hill. When or how these catacombs could have been constructed, Weeden was unable to say; but he frequently pointed out how easily the place might have been reached by bands of unseen workmen from the river. Joseph Curwen put his mongrel seamen to diverse uses indeed! During the heavy spring rains of 1769 the two watchers kept a sharp eye on the steep river-bank to see if any subterrene secrets might be washed to light, and were rewarded by the sight of a profusion of both human and animal bones in places where deep gullies had been worn in the banks. Naturally there might be many explanations of such things in the rear of a stock farm, and in a locality where old Indian burying-grounds were common, but Weeden and Smith drew their own inferences.      It was in January 1770, whilst Weeden and Smith were still debating vainly on what, if anything, to think or do about the whole bewildering business, that the incident of the Fortaleza occurred. Exasperated by the burning of the revenue sloop Liberty at Newport during the previous summer, the customs fleet under Admiral Wallace had adopted an increased vigilance concerning strange vessels; and on this occasion His Majestys armed schooner Cygnet, under Capt. Charles Leslie, captured after a short pursuit one early morning the snow Fortaleza of Barcelona, Spain, under Capt. Manuel Arruda, bound according to its log from Grand Cairo, Egypt, to Providence. When searched for contraband material, this ship revealed the astonishing fact that its cargo consisted exclusively of Egyptian mummies, consigned to \"Sailor A. B. C.\", who would come to remove his goods in a lighter just off Namquit Point and whose identity Capt. Arruda felt himself in honour bound not to reveal. The Vice-Admiralty Court at Newport, at a loss what to do in view of the non-contraband nature of the cargo on the one hand and of the unlawful secrecy of the entry on the other hand, compromised on Collector Robinsons recommendation by freeing the ship but forbidding it a port in Rhode Island waters. There were later rumours of its having been seen in Boston Harbour, though it never openly entered the Port of Boston.      This extraordinary incident did not fail of wide remark in Providence, and there were not many who doubted the existence of some connexion between the cargo of mummies and the sinister Joseph Curwen. His exotic studies and his curious chemical importations being common knowledge, and his fondness for graveyards being common suspicion; it did not take much imagination to link him with a freakish importation which could not conceivably have been destined for anyone else in the town. As if conscious of this natural belief, Curwen took care to speak casually on several occasions of the chemical value of the balsams found in mummies; thinking perhaps that he might make the affair seem less unnatural, yet stopping just short of admitting his participation. Weeden and Smith, of course, felt no doubt whatsoever of the significance of the thing; and indulged in the wildest theories concerning Curwen and his monstrous labours.      The following spring, like that of the year before, had heavy rains; and the watchers kept careful track of the river-bank behind the Curwen farm. Large sections were washed away, and a certain number of bones discovered; but no glimpse was afforded of any actual subterranean chambers or burrows. Something was rumoured, however, at the village of Pawtuxet about a mile below, where the river flows in falls over a rocky terrace to join the placid landlocked cove. There, where quaint old cottages climbed the hill from the rustic bridge, and fishing-smacks lay anchored at their sleepy docks, a vague report went round of things that were floating down the river and flashing into sight for a minute as they went over the falls. Of course the Pawtuxet is a long river which winds through many settled regions abounding in graveyards, and of course the spring rains had been very heavy; but the fisherfolk about the bridge did not like the wild way that one of the things stared as it shot down to the still water below, or the way that another half cried out although its condition had greatly departed from that of objects which normally cry out. That rumour sent Smith - for Weeden was just then at sea - in haste to the river-bank behind the farm; where surely enough there remained the evidences of an extensive cave-in. There was, however, no trace of a passage into the steep bank; for the miniature avalanche had left behind a solid wall of mixed earth and shrubbery from aloft. Smith went to the extent of some experimental digging, but was deterred by lack of success - or perhaps by fear of possible success. It is interesting to speculate on what the persistent and revengeful Weeden would have done had he been ashore at the time.4.      By the autumn of 1770 Weeden decided that the time was ripe to tell others of his discoveries; for he had a large number of facts to link together, and a second eye-witness to refute the possible charge that jealousy and vindictiveness had spurred his fancy. As his first confidant he selected Capt. James Mathewson of the Enterprise, who on the one hand knew him well enough not to doubt his veracity, and on the other hand was sufficiently influential in the town to be heard in turn with respect. The colloquy took place in an upper room of Sabins Tavern near the docks, with Smith present to corroborate virtually every statement; and it could be seen that Capt. Mathewson was tremendously impressed. Like nearly everyone else in the town, he had had black suspicions of his own anent Joseph Curwen; hence it needed only this confirmation and enlargement of data to convince him absolutely. At the end of the conference he was very grave, and enjoined strict silence upon the two younger men. He would, he said, transmit the information separately to some ten or so of the most learned and prominent citizens of Providence; ascertaining their views and following whatever advice they might have to offer. Secrecy would probably be essential in any case, for this was no matter that the town constables or militia could cope with; and above all else the excitable crowd must be kept in ignorance, lest there be enacted in these already troublous times a repetition of that frightful Salem panic of less than a century before which had first brought Curwen hither.      The right persons to tell, he believed, would be Dr. Benjamin West, whose pamphlet on the late transit of Venus proved him a scholar and keen thinker; Rev. James Manning, President of the College which had just moved up from Warren and was temporarily housed in the new King Street schoolhouse awaiting the completion of its building on the hill above Presbyterian-Lane; ex-Governor Stephen Hopkins, who had been a member of the Philosophical Society at Newport, and was a man of very broad perceptions; John Carter, publisher of the Gazette; all four of the Brown brothers, John, Joseph, Nicholas, and Moses, who formed the recognised local magnates, and of whom Joseph was an amateur scientist of parts; old Dr. Jabez Bowen, whose erudition was considerable, and who had much first-hand knowledge of Curwens odd purchases; and Capt. Abraham Whipple, a privateersman of phenomenal boldness and energy who could be counted on to lead in any active measures needed. These men, if favourable, might eventually be brought together for collective deliberation; and with them would rest the responsibility of deciding whether or not to inform the Governor of the Colony, Joseph Wanton of Newport, before taking action.      The mission of Capt. Mathewson prospered beyond his highest expectations; for whilst he found one or two of the chosen confidants somewhat sceptical of the possible ghastly side of Weedens tale, there was not one who did not think it necessary to take some sort of secret and cordinated action. Curwen, it was clear, formed a vague potential menace to the welfare of the town and Colony; and must be eliminated at any cost. Late in December 1770 a group of eminent townsmen met at the home of Stephen Hopkins and debated tentative measures. Weedens notes, which he had given to Capt. Mathewson, were carefully read; and he and Smith were summoned to give testimony anent details. Something very like fear seized the whole assemblage before the meeting was over, though there ran through that fear a grim determination which Capt. Whipples bluff and resonant profanity best expressed. They would not notify the Governor, because a more than legal course seemed necessary. With hidden powers of uncertain extent apparently at his disposal, Curwen was not a man who could safely be warned to leave town. Nameless reprisals might ensue, and even if the sinister creature complied, the removal would be no more than the shifting of an unclean burden to another place. The times were lawless, and men who had flouted the Kings revenue forces for years were not the ones to balk at sterner things when duty impelled. Curwen must be surprised at his Pawtuxet farm by a large raiding-party of seasoned privateersmen and given one decisive chance to explain himself. If he proved a madman, amusing himself with shrieks and imaginary conversations in different voices, he would be properly confined. If something graver appeared, and if the underground horrors indeed turned out to be real, he and all with him must die. It could be done quietly, and even the widow and her father need not be told how it came about.      While these serious steps were under discussion there occurred in the town an incident so terrible and inexplicable that for a time little else was mentioned for miles around. In the middle of a moonlight January night with heavy snow underfoot there resounded over the river and up the hill a shocking series of cries which brought sleepy heads to every window; and people around Weybosset Point saw a great white thing plunging frantically along the badly cleared space in front of the Turks Head. There was a baying of dogs in the distance, but this subsided as soon as the clamour of the awakened town became audible. Parties of men with lanterns and muskets hurried out to see what was happening, but nothing rewarded their search. The next morning, however, a giant, muscular body, stark naked, was found on the jams of ice around the southern piers of the Great Bridge, where the Long Dock stretched out beside Abbotts distil-house, and the identity of this object became a theme for endless speculation and whispering. It was not so much the younger as the older folk who whispered, for only in the patriarchs did that rigid face with horror-bulging eyes strike any chord of memory. They, shaking as they did so, exchanged furtive murmurs of wonder and fear; for in those stiff, hideous features lay a resemblance so marvellous as to be almost an identity - and that identity was with a man who had died full fifty years before.      Ezra Weeden was present at the finding; and remembering the baying of the night before, set out along Weybosset Street and across Muddy Dock Bridge whence the sound had come. He had a curious expectancy, and was not surprised when, reaching the edge of the settled district where the street merged into the Pawtuxet Road, he came upon some very curious tracks in the snow. The naked giant had been pursued by dogs and many booted men, and the returning tracks of the hounds and their masters could be easily traced. They had given up the chase upon coming too near the town. Weeden smiled grimly, and as a perfunctory detail traced the footprints back to their source. It was the Pawtuxet farm of Joseph Curwen, as he well knew it would be; and he would have given much had the yard been less confusingly trampled. As it was, he dared not seem too interested in full daylight. Dr. Bowen, to whom Weeden went at once with his report, performed an autopsy on the strange corpse, and discovered peculiarities which baffled him utterly. The digestive tracts of the huge man seemed never to have been in use, whilst the whole skin had a coarse, loosely knit texture impossible to account for. Impressed by what the old men whispered of this bodys likeness to the long-dead blacksmith Daniel Green, whose great-grandson Aaron Hoppin was a supercargo in Curwens employ, Weeden asked casual questions till he found where Green was buried. That night a party of ten visited the old North Burying Ground opposite Herrendens Lane and opened a grave. They found it vacant, precisely as they had expected.      Meanwhile arrangements had been made with the post riders to intercept Joseph Curwens mail, and shortly before the incident of the naked body there was found a letter from one Jedediah Orne of Salem which made the coperating citizens think deeply. Parts of it, copied and preserved in the private archives of the Smith family where Charles Ward found it, ran as follows:      \"I delight that you continue in ye Gettg at Olde Matters in your Way, and doe not think better was done at Mr. Hutchinsons in Salem-Village. Certainely, there was Nothg butt ye liveliest Awfulness in that which H. raisd upp from What he coud gather onlie a part of. What you sente, did not Worke, whether because of Any Thing missg, or because ye Wordes were not Righte from my Speakg or yr Copyg. I alone am at a Loss. I have not ye Chymicall art to followe Borellus, and owne my Self confounded by ye VII. Booke of ye Necronomicon that you recommende. But I woud have you Observe what was tolde to us aboute takg Care whom to calle up, for you are Sensible what Mr. Mather writ in ye Magnalia of  -  - , and can judge how truely that Horrendous thing is reported. I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe; by the Which I meane, Any that can in Turne call up somewhat against you, whereby your Powerfullest Devices may not be of use. Ask of the Lesser, lest the Greater shall not wish to Answer, and shall commande more than you. I was frighted when I read of your knowg what Ben Zariatnatmik hadde in his ebony Boxe, for I was conscious who must have tolde you. And againe I ask that you shalle write me as Jedediah and not Simon. In this Community a Man may not live too long, and you knowe my Plan by which I came back as my Son. I am desirous you will Acquaint me with what ye Blacke Man learnt from Sylvanus Cocidius in ye Vault, under ye Roman Wall, and will be obligd for ye Lendg of ye MS. you speak of.\"      Another and unsigned letter from Philadelphia provoked equal thought, especially for the following passage:      \"I will observe what you say respecting the sending of Accounts only by yr Vessels, but can not always be certain when to expect them. In the Matter spoke of, I require onlie one more thing; but wish to be sure I apprehend you exactly. You inform me, that no Part must be missing if the finest Effects are to be had, but you can not but know how hard it is to be sure. It seems a great Hazard and Burthen to take away the whole Box, and in Town (i.e. St. Peters, St. Pauls, St. Marys, or Christ Church) it can scarce be done at all. But I know what Imperfections were in the one I raisd up October last, and how many live Specimens you were forcd to imploy before you hit upon the right Mode in the year 1766; so will be guided by you in all Matters. I am impatient for yr Brig, and inquire daily at Mr. Biddles Wharf.\"      A third suspicious letter was in an unknown tongue and even an unknown alphabet. In the Smith diary found by Charles Ward a single oft-repeated combination of characters is clumsily copied; and authorities at Brown University have pronounced the alphabet Amharic or Abyssinian, although they do not recognise the word. None of these epistles was ever delivered to Curwen, though the disappearance of Jedediah Orne from Salem as recorded shortly afterward shewed that the Providence men took certain quiet steps. The Pennsylvania Historical Society also has some curious letters received by Dr. Shippen regarding the presence of an unwholesome character in Philadelphia. But more decisive steps were in the air, and it is in the secret assemblages of sworn and tested sailors and faithful old privateersmen in the Brown warehouses by night that we must look for the main fruits of Weedens disclosures. Slowly and surely a plan of campaign was under development which would leave no trace of Joseph Curwens noxious mysteries.      Curwen, despite all precautions, apparently felt that something was in the wind; for he was now remarked to wear an unusually worried look. His coach was seen at all hours in the town and on the Pawtuxet Road, and he dropped little by little the air of forced geniality with which he had latterly sought to combat the towns prejudice. The nearest neighbours to his farm, the Fenners, one night remarked a great shaft of light shooting into the sky from some aperture in the roof of that cryptical stone building with the high, excessively narrow windows; an event which they quickly communicated to John Brown in Providence. Mr. Brown had become the executive leader of the select group bent on Curwens extirpation, and had informed the Fenners that some action was about to be taken. This he deemed needful because of the impossibility of their not witnessing the final raid; and he explained his course by saying that Curwen was known to be a spy of the customs officers at Newport, against whom the hand of every Providence shipper, merchant, and farmer was openly or clandestinely raised. Whether the ruse was wholly believed by neighbours who had seen so many queer things is not certain; but at any rate the Fenners were willing to connect any evil with a man of such queer ways. To them Mr. Brown had entrusted the duty of watching the Curwen farmhouse, and of regularly reporting every incident which took place there.5.      The probability that Curwen was on guard and attempting unusual things, as suggested by the odd shaft of light, precipitated at last the action so carefully devised by the band of serious citizens. According to the Smith diary a company of about 100 men met at 10 p.m. on Friday, April 12th, 1771, in the great room of Thurstons Tavern at the Sign of the Golden Lion on Weybosset Point across the Bridge. Of the guiding group of prominent men in addition to the leader John Brown there were present Dr. Bowen, with his case of surgical instruments, President Manning without the great periwig (the largest in the Colonies) for which he was noted, Governor Hopkins, wrapped in his dark cloak and accompanied by his seafaring brother Esek, whom he had initiated at the last moment with the permission of the rest, John Carter, Capt. Mathewson, and Capt. Whipple, who was to lead the actual raiding party. These chiefs conferred apart in a rear chamber, after which Capt. Whipple emerged to the great room and gave the gathered seamen their last oaths and instructions. Eleazar Smith was with the leaders as they sat in the rear apartment awaiting the arrival of Ezra Weeden, whose duty was to keep track of Curwen and report the departure of his coach for the farm.      About 10:30 a heavy rumble was heard on the Great Bridge, followed by the sound of a coach in the street outside; and at that hour there was no need of waiting for Weeden in order to know that the doomed man had set out for his last night of unhallowed wizardry. A moment later, as the receding coach clattered faintly over the Muddy Dock Bridge, Weeden appeared; and the raiders fell silently into military order in the street, shouldering the firelocks, fowling-pieces, or whaling harpoons which they had with them. Weeden and Smith were with the party, and of the deliberating citizens there were present for active service Capt. Whipple, the leader, Capt. Esek Hopkins, John Carter, President Manning, Capt. Mathewson, and Dr. Bowen; together with Moses Brown, who had come up at the eleventh hour though absent from the preliminary session in the tavern. All these freemen and their hundred sailors began the long march without delay, grim and a trifle apprehensive as they left the Muddy Dock behind and mounted the gentle rise of Broad Street toward the Pawtuxet Road. Just beyond Elder Snows church some of the men turned back to take a parting look at Providence lying outspread under the early spring stars. Steeples and gables rose dark and shapely, and salt breezes swept up gently from the cove north of the Bridge. Vega was climbing above the great hill across the water, whose crest of trees was broken by the roof-line of the unfinished College edifice. At the foot of that hill, and along the narrow mounting lanes of its side, the old town dreamed; Old Providence, for whose safety and sanity so monstrous and colossal a blasphemy was about to be wiped out.      An hour and a quarter later the raiders arrived, as previously agreed, at the Fenner farmhouse; where they heard a final report on their intended victim. He had reached his farm over half an hour before, and the strange light had soon afterward shot once into the sky, but there were no lights in any visible windows. This was always the case of late. Even as this news was given another great glare arose toward the south, and the party realised that they had indeed come close to the scene of awesome and unnatural wonders. Capt. Whipple now ordered his force to separate into three divisions; one of twenty men under Eleazar Smith to strike across to the shore and guard the landing-place against possible reinforcements for Curwen until summoned by a messenger for desperate service, a second of twenty men under Capt. Esek Hopkins to steal down into the river valley behind the Curwen farm and demolish with axes or gunpowder the oaken door in the high, steep bank, and the third to close in on the house and adjacent buildings themselves. Of this division one third was to be led by Capt. Mathewson to the cryptical stone edifice with high narrow windows, another third to follow Capt. Whipple himself to the main farmhouse, and the remaining third to preserve a circle around the whole group of buildings until summoned by a final emergency signal.      The river party would break down the hillside door at the sound of a single whistle-blast, then waiting and capturing anything which might issue from the regions within. At the sound of two whistle-blasts it would advance through the aperture to oppose the enemy or join the rest of the raiding contingent. The party at the stone building would accept these respective signals in an analogous manner; forcing an entrance at the first, and at the second descending whatever passage into the ground might be discovered, and joining the general or focal warfare expected to take place within the caverns. A third or emergency signal of three blasts would summon the immediate reserve from its general guard duty; its twenty men dividing equally and entering the unknown depths through both farmhouse and stone building. Capt. Whipples belief in the existence of catacombs was absolute, and he took no alternative into consideration when making his plans. He had with him a whistle of great power and shrillness, and did not fear any upsetting or misunderstanding of signals. The final reserve at the landing, of course, was nearly out of the whistles range; hence would require a special messenger if needed for help. Moses Brown and John Carter went with Capt. Hopkins to the river-bank, while President Manning was detailed with Capt. Mathewson to the stone building. Dr. Bowen, with Ezra Weeden, remained in Capt. Whipples party which was to storm the farmhouse itself. The attack was to begin as soon as a messenger from Capt. Hopkins had joined Capt. Whipple to notify him of the river partys readiness. The leader would then deliver the loud single blast, and the various advance parties would commence their simultaneous attack on three points. Shortly before 1 a.m. the three divisions left the Fenner farmhouse; one to guard the landing, another to seek the river valley and the hillside door, and the third to subdivide and attend to the actual buildings of the Curwen farm.      Eleazar Smith, who accompanied the shore-guarding party, records in his diary an uneventful march and a long wait on the bluff by the bay; broken once by what seemed to be the distant sound of the signal whistle and again by a peculiar muffled blend of roaring and crying and a powder blast which seemed to come from the same direction. Later on one man thought he caught some distant gunshots, and still later Smith himself felt the throb of titanic and thunderous words resounding in upper air. It was just before dawn that a single haggard messenger with wild eyes and a hideous unknown odour about his clothing appeared and told the detachment to disperse quietly to their homes and never again think or speak of the nights doings or of him who had been Joseph Curwen. Something about the bearing of the messenger carried a conviction which his mere words could never have conveyed; for though he was a seaman well known to many of them, there was something obscurely lost or gained in his soul which set him for evermore apart. It was the same later on when they met other old companions who had gone into that zone of horror. Most of them had lost or gained something imponderable and indescribable. They had seen or heard or felt something which was not for human creatures, and could not forget it. From them there was never any gossip, for to even the commonest of mortal instincts there are terrible boundaries. And from that single messenger the party at the shore caught a nameless awe which almost sealed their own lips. Very few are the rumours which ever came from any of them, and Eleazar Smiths diary is the only written record which has survived from that whole expedition which set forth from the Sign of the Golden Lion under the stars.      Charles Ward, however, discovered another vague sidelight in some Fenner correspondence which he found in New London, where he knew another branch of the family had lived. It seems that the Fenners, from whose house the doomed farm was distantly visible, had watched the departing columns of raiders; and had heard very clearly the angry barking of the Curwen dogs, followed by the first shrill blast which precipitated the attack. This blast had been followed by a repetition of the great shaft of light from the stone building, and in another moment, after a quick sounding of the second signal ordering a general invasion, there had come a subdued prattle of musketry followed by a horrible roaring cry which the correspondent Luke Fenner had represented in his epistle by the characters \"Waaaahrrrrr - Rwaaahrrr\". This cry, however, had possessed a quality which no mere writing could convey, and the correspondent mentions that his mother fainted completely at the sound. It was later repeated less loudly, and further but more muffled evidences of gunfire ensued; together with a loud explosion of powder from the direction of the river. About an hour afterward all the dogs began to bark frightfully, and there were vague ground rumblings so marked that the candlesticks tottered on the mantelpiece. A strong smell of sulphur was noted; and Luke Fenners father declared that he heard the third or emergency whistle signal, though the others failed to detect it. Muffled musketry sounded again, followed by a deep scream less piercing but even more horrible than those which had preceded it; a kind of throaty, nastily plastic cough or gurgle whose quality as a scream must have come more from its continuity and psychological import than from its actual acoustic value.      Then the flaming thing burst into sight at a point where the Curwen farm ought to lie, and the human cries of desperate and frightened men were heard. Muskets flashed and cracked, and the flaming thing fell to the ground. A second flaming thing appeared, and a shriek of human origin was plainly distinguished. Fenner wrote that he could even gather a few words belched in frenzy: \"Almighty, protect thy lamb!\" Then there were more shots, and the second flaming thing fell. After that came silence for about three-quarters of an hour; at the end of which time little Arthur Fenner, Lukes brother, exclaimed that he saw a red fog going up to the stars from the accursed farm in the distance. No one but the child can testify to this, but Luke admits the significant coincidence implied by the panic of almost convulsive fright which at the same moment arched the backs and stiffened the fur of the three cats then within the room.      Five minutes later a chill wind blew up, and the air became suffused with such an intolerable stench that only the strong freshness of the sea could have prevented its being noticed by the shore party or by any wakeful souls in Pawtuxet village. This stench was nothing which any of the Fenners had ever encountered before, and produced a kind of clutching, amorphous fear beyond that of the tomb or the charnel-house. Close upon it came the awful voice which no hapless hearer will ever be able to forget. It thundered out of the sky like a doom, and windows rattled as its echoes died away. It was deep and musical; powerful as a bass organ, but evil as the forbidden books of the Arabs. What it said no man can tell, for it spoke in an unknown tongue, but this is the writing Luke Fenner set down to portray the daemoniac intonations: \"DEESMEES-JESHET-BONE DOSEFE DUVEMA-ENITEMOSS\". Not till the year 1919 did any soul link this crude transcript with anything else in mortal knowledge, but Charles Ward paled as he recognised what Mirandola had denounced in shudders as the ultimate horror among black magics incantations.      An unmistakably human shout or deep chorused scream seemed to answer this malign wonder from the Curwen farm, after which the unknown stench grew complex with an added odour equally intolerable. A wailing distinctly different from the scream now burst out, and was protracted ululantly in rising and falling paroxysms. At times it became almost articulate, though no auditor could trace any definite words; and at one point it seemed to verge toward the confines of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Then a yell of utter, ultimate fright and stark madness wrenched from scores of human throats - a yell which came strong and clear despite the depth from which it must have burst; after which darkness and silence ruled all things. Spirals of acrid smoke ascended to blot out the stars, though no flames appeared and no buildings were observed to be gone or injured on the following day.      Toward dawn two frightened messengers with monstrous and unplaceable odours saturating their clothing knocked at the Fenner door and requested a keg of rum, for which they paid very well indeed. One of them told the family that the affair of Joseph Curwen was over, and that the events of the night were not to be mentioned again. Arrogant as the order seemed, the aspect of him who gave it took away all resentment and lent it a fearsome authority; so that only these furtive letters of Luke Fenner, which he urged his Connecticut relative to destroy, remain to tell what was seen and heard. The non-compliance of that relative, whereby the letters were saved after all, has alone kept the matter from a merciful oblivion. Charles Ward had one detail to add as a result of a long canvass of Pawtuxet residents for ancestral traditions. Old Charles Slocum of that village said that there was known to his grandfather a queer rumour concerning a charred, distorted body found in the fields a week after the death of Joseph Curwen was announced. What kept the talk alive was the notion that this body, so far as could be seen in its burnt and twisted condition, was neither thoroughly human nor wholly allied to any animal which Pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about.6.      Not one man who participated in that terrible raid could ever be induced to say a word concerning it, and every fragment of the vague data which survives comes from those outside the final fighting party. There is something frightful in the care with which these actual raiders destroyed each scrap which bore the least allusion to the matter. Eight sailors had been killed, but although their bodies were not produced their families were satisfied with the statement that a clash with customs officers had occurred. The same statement also covered the numerous cases of wounds, all of which were extensively bandaged and treated only by Dr. Jabez Bowen, who had accompanied the party. Hardest to explain was the nameless odour clinging to all the raiders, a thing which was discussed for weeks. Of the citizen leaders, Capt. Whipple and Moses Brown were most severely hurt, and letters of their wives testify the bewilderment which their reticence and close guarding of their bandages produced. Psychologically every participant was aged, sobered, and shaken. It is fortunate that they were all strong men of action and simple, orthodox religionists, for with more subtle introspectiveness and mental complexity they would have fared ill indeed. President Manning was the most disturbed; but even he outgrew the darkest shadow, and smothered memories in prayers. Every man of those leaders had a stirring part to play in later years, and it is perhaps fortunate that this is so. Little more than a twelvemonth afterward Capt. Whipple led the mob who burnt the revenue ship Gaspee, and in this bold act we may trace one step in the blotting out of unwholesome images.      There was delivered to the widow of Joseph Curwen a sealed leaden coffin of curious design, obviously found ready on the spot when needed, in which she was told her husbands body lay. He had, it was explained, been killed in a customs battle about which it was not politic to give details. More than this no tongue ever uttered of Joseph Curwens end, and Charles Ward had only a single hint wherewith to construct a theory. This hint was the merest thread - a shaky underscoring of a passage in Jedediah Ornes confiscated letter to Curwen, as partly copied in Ezra Weedens handwriting. The copy was found in the possession of Smiths descendants; and we are left to decide whether Weeden gave it to his companion after the end, as a mute clue to the abnormality which had occurred, or whether, as is more probable, Smith had it before, and added the underscoring himself from what he had managed to extract from his friend by shrewd guessing and adroit cross-questioning. The underlined passage is merely this:      \"I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe; by the Which I meane, Any that can in Turne call up somewhat against you, whereby your Powerfullest Devices may not be of use. Ask of the Lesser, lest the Greater shall not wish to Answer, and shall commande more than you.\"In the light of this passage, and reflecting on what last unmentionable allies a beaten man might try to summon in his direst extremity, Charles Ward may well have wondered whether any citizen of Providence killed Joseph Curwen.      The deliberate effacement of every memory of the dead man from Providence life and annals was vastly aided by the influence of the raiding leaders. They had not at first meant to be so thorough, and had allowed the widow and her father and child to remain in ignorance of the true conditions; but Capt. Tillinghast was an astute man, and soon uncovered enough rumours to whet his horror and cause him to demand that his daughter and granddaughter change their name, burn the library and all remaining papers, and chisel the inscription from the slate slab above Joseph Curwens grave. He knew Capt. Whipple well, and probably extracted more hints from that bluff mariner than anyone else ever gained respecting the end of the accused sorcerer.      From that time on the obliteration of Curwens memory became increasingly rigid, extending at last by common consent even to the town records and files of the Gazette. It can be compared in spirit only to the hush that lay on Oscar Wildes name for a decade after his disgrace, and in extent only to the fate of that sinful King of Runazar in Lord Dunsanys tale, whom the Gods decided must not only cease to be, but must cease ever to have been.      Mrs. Tillinghast, as the widow became known after 1772, sold the house in Olney Court and resided with her father in Powers Lane till her death in 1817. The farm at Pawtuxet, shunned by every living soul, remained to moulder through the years; and seemed to decay with unaccountable rapidity. By 1780 only the stone and brickwork were standing, and by 1800 even these had fallen to shapeless heaps. None ventured to pierce the tangled shrubbery on the river-bank behind which the hillside door may have lain, nor did any try to frame a definite image of the scenes amidst which Joseph Curwen departed from the horrors he had wrought.      Only robust old Capt. Whipple was heard by alert listeners to mutter once in a while to himself, \"Pox on that  -  -  - , but he had no business to laugh while he screamed. Twas as though the damnd  -  -  -  had someat up his sleeve. For half a crown Id burn his  -  -  -  house.\"", "III.Meanwhile Old Whateley continued to buy cattle without measurably increasing the size of his herd. He also cut timber and began to repair the unused parts of his house—a spacious, peaked-roofed affair whose rear end was buried entirely in the rocky hillside, and whose three least-ruined ground-floor rooms had always been sufficient for himself and his daughter. There must have been prodigious reserves of strength in the old man to enable him to accomplish so much hard labour; and though he still babbled dementedly at times, his carpentry seemed to shew the effects of sound calculation. It had already begun as soon as Wilbur was born, when one of the many tool-sheds had been put suddenly in order, clapboarded, and fitted with a stout fresh lock. Now, in restoring the abandoned upper story of the house, he was a no less thorough craftsman. His mania shewed itself only in his tight boarding-up of all the windows in the reclaimed section—though many declared that it was a crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at all. Less inexplicable was his fitting up of another downstairs room for his new grandson—a room which several callers saw, though no one was ever admitted to the closely boarded upper story. This chamber he lined with tall, firm shelving; along which he began gradually to arrange, in apparently careful order, all the rotting ancient books and parts of books which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously in odd corners of the various rooms.      “I made some use of ’em,” he would say as he tried to mend a torn black-letter page with paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove, “but the boy’s fitten to make better use of ’em. He’d orter hev ’em as well sot as he kin, for they’re goin’ to be all of his larnin’.”      When Wilbur was a year and seven months old—in September of 1914—his size and accomplishments were almost alarming. He had grown as large as a child of four, and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker. He ran freely about the fields and hills, and accompanied his mother on all her wanderings. At home he would pore diligently over the queer pictures and charts in his grandfather’s books, while Old Whateley would instruct and catechise him through long, hushed afternoons. By this time the restoration of the house was finished, and those who watched it wondered why one of the upper windows had been made into a solid plank door. It was a window in the rear of the east gable end, close against the hill; and no one could imagine why a cleated wooden runway was built up to it from the ground. About the period of this work’s completion people noticed that the old tool-house, tightly locked and windowlessly clapboarded since Wilbur’s birth, had been abandoned again. The door swung listlessly open, and when Earl Sawyer once stepped within after a cattle-selling call on Old Whateley he was quite discomposed by the singular odour he encountered—such a stench, he averred, as he had never before smelt in all his life except near the Indian circles on the hills, and which could not come from anything sane or of this earth. But then, the homes and sheds of Dunwich folk have never been remarkable for olfactory immaculateness.      The following months were void of visible events, save that everyone swore to a slow but steady increase in the mysterious hill noises. On May-Eve of 1915 there were tremors which even the Aylesbury people felt, whilst the following Hallowe’en produced an underground rumbling queerly synchronised with bursts of flame—“them witch Whateleys’ doin’s”—from the summit of Sentinel Hill. Wilbur was growing up uncannily, so that he looked like a boy of ten as he entered his fourth year. He read avidly by himself now; but talked much less than formerly. A settled taciturnity was absorbing him, and for the first time people began to speak specifically of the dawning look of evil in his goatish face. He would sometimes mutter an unfamiliar jargon, and chant in bizarre rhythms which chilled the listener with a sense of unexplainable terror. The aversion displayed toward him by dogs had now become a matter of wide remark, and he was obliged to carry a pistol in order to traverse the countryside in safety. His occasional use of the weapon did not enhance his popularity amongst the owners of canine guardians.      The few callers at the house would often find Lavinia alone on the ground floor, while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the boarded-up second story. She would never tell what her father and the boy were doing up there, though once she turned pale and displayed an abnormal degree of fear when a jocose fish-peddler tried the locked door leading to the stairway. That peddler told the store loungers at Dunwich Village that he thought he heard a horse stamping on that floor above. The loungers reflected, thinking of the door and runway, and of the cattle that so swiftly disappeared. Then they shuddered as they recalled tales of Old Whateley’s youth, and of the strange things that are called out of the earth when a bullock is sacrificed at the proper time to certain heathen gods. It had for some time been noticed that dogs had begun to hate and fear the whole Whateley place as violently as they hated and feared young Wilbur personally.      In 1917 the war came, and Squire Sawyer Whateley, as chairman of the local draft board, had hard work finding a quota of young Dunwich men fit even to be sent to a development camp. The government, alarmed at such signs of wholesale regional decadence, sent several officers and medical experts to investigate; conducting a survey which New England newspaper readers may still recall. It was the publicity attending this investigation which set reporters on the track of the Whateleys, and caused the Boston Globe and Arkham Advertiser to print flamboyant Sunday stories of young Wilbur’s precociousness, Old Whateley’s black magic, the shelves of strange books, the sealed second story of the ancient farmhouse, and the weirdness of the whole region and its hill noises. Wilbur was four and a half then, and looked like a lad of fifteen. His lips and cheeks were fuzzy with a coarse dark down, and his voice had begun to break.      Earl Sawyer went out to the Whateley place with both sets of reporters and camera men, and called their attention to the queer stench which now seemed to trickle down from the sealed upper spaces. It was, he said, exactly like a smell he had found in the tool-shed abandoned when the house was finally repaired; and like the faint odours which he sometimes thought he caught near the stone circles on the mountains. Dunwich folk read the stories when they appeared, and grinned over the obvious mistakes. They wondered, too, why the writers made so much of the fact that Old Whateley always paid for his cattle in gold pieces of extremely ancient date. The Whateleys had received their visitors with ill-concealed distaste, though they did not dare court further publicity by a violent resistance or refusal to talk."]}
{"id": "EN077", "pair": ["Spoonbill Village, Northernmost Quang Binh Province, SRV.June 30, 2011.Considering their first encounter, this meeting was going rather well.\"No, no, I assure you that I have had quite enough… well, if you insist…\" In the course of explaining his task to the household he would be staying in, Joseph Clayton had been offered tea at the behest of the mistress of the household and all three times, he had acquiesced. She was attending her husband in fine cotton clothes of white and black, the cut more resembling something out of Javanese dancing than anything worn in Indochina during the past thousand years. Their son, called from his lessons for the presentation, was sitting at the far end of the room, listening to what was going on. While he had repeated much the same spiel that Professor Andover to the houses three inhabitants, he had sipped at his bowl almost automatically as one would with water, clear onto what was now his fourth helping. Although not unpleasant, the drink had considerably more kick to it than even the strong brews typical of Vietnamese green tea.What perplexed Joseph was that he couldnt identify the extra ingredient. It wasnt peppers, having no discernible remains or even the raw chemical heat of capsaicin. It could be ginger, but the heat was of an utterly different kind than any ginger he had ever experienced.Then again, the additive could just as well be Tarantula venom given the figure he was giving his introduction to.His name, as he had given it, was Noc. He was the most experience hunter, archer and scout of the village, was of an incredibly ancient lineage and, incidentally, was the first person of this strange, isolated village that he had seen. His tattoos all featured arachnid themes of legs, webbing and fangs and his eyes…Marie had mentioned that some of the warriors practiced sorcery with mutative effects. If that was what caused Nocs eyes to become all black, seemingly all pupils and tempting Joseph to mentally refer to the man as \"Spider Eye\", then maybe those three weirdoes they caught in the biology labs back in February were onto something after all.Sitting in the main reception area of the home, replete with decorations of strange latticed designs and black lacquer, Joseph watched carefully as Noc finished examining one of his bowstrings before his eyes darted around the room. On the wall, several bows hung in their unstrung state: the white and banded flatbow he had first witnessed, several simple bows of light colored cane and even one recurve bow made of dark red hardwood.\"So that is your request: to hear the stories of our history, to observe the operation of a household of status and to… take part in our activities?\" Throughout the introduction of this man and the repetition he had given of the Professors offer, Noc had examined all aspects of him closely… and had not been impressed. He had some muscle tone, but everything else about him absolutely screamed that he was some sort of priest or urban scribe in training. Besides, the combination of the girls cues toward him and his reaction to his tea made it clear: if the boy had been a virgin, steam would have been pouring out of his ears. That made things difficult (and potentially dangerous) for everyone.Besides, very few people in this village held any affection at all for someone with Josephs skin tone.After receiving affirmation of Josephs duties, Noc laid out the rules. \"Know this: you will record the histories when they are told to you. You shall ask questions when you are allowed and you shall observe what you shall participate in what you are allowed to participate in. No pestering me with questions, no sneaking around trying to observe the women and children and no and I mean no trying to wheedle out information through trickery. We had quite enough trouble with that sort of thing the last time around.\"Joseph was immediately insulted, even though he did not how it as he automatically agreed. Still, two things bothered him. First, underneath the gold and bronze bangles that decorated the forearms and ankles of Nocs wife, Joseph had noticed strange scars, akin in shape to the marks that sperm whales bore from their battles with giant squid.Second… what did Noc mean by the last time around?That Night…As he lay awake, Joseph realized how exhausting the day had been. As it turned out, he was probably doing to spend most of his time in this house as a sort of a servant: documenting and participating in cooking and chores, handling domestic duties and picking little things up only as Nocs wife deemed appropriate. No real questions answered, no interesting discoveries or scandals or surprises… just ordinary ethnographic work.It wasnt made any better that his libido was getting annoyed at the busy signals it kept receiving. However, there had been no real opportunity to talk with Marie after last night, with all the revelations of cannibalism and sorcery and other things that probably should have made his stomach turn./Maybe it would be better if they had made your stomach turn./ Came a wheedling little multi-voiced dialogue from inside his head… from inside his head, but not originating from him.Oh no. Joseph thought with a mental groan. Not you idiots again! I thought you gave it up after the last time./The last time? You mean when you were in the thrall of carnal lusts, disgracing your heritage?/ The dominant voice changed from one of the old WASP lords to that of an aristocratic dowager that had been ancient even when Granny Clara had been a girl. /Maybe now that you know what her kind get up to, you will listen to reason and find a girl more suitable to a young man of your station./Her parents are just as middle class as mine are, thank you all very much. Joseph snarked back mentally, fully knowing how these… wraiths felt about his relationship with Marie and savoring the thought of causing them anguish./You know full well what is meant. What is not understood is why the other girl did not so arouse your… passions./Oh please, her family is just as drenched in sorcery as these guys, its just that theyre more polite about who they slice open. Besides, I dont really think youd have acted any differently if it had been Tracy Id been with that night instead of Marie, inbred and rural as she apparently is. He remembered clearly that night: how these voices (who he was fairly sure were not the products of schizophrenia despite superficially similar symptomatology), had come to him in the midst of what should have been unimaginable passion and communion with his girlfriend (though with was much more awkward, rushed and possibly painful than desired). Even as the passion mounted, their insults became worse: the taunts, the archaic, hateful rhetoric, the most vicious slurs directed against Marie and him. And yet he had forged on, continuing despite the rising chorus of insane voices inside his head… or even because of them, for as they blasphemed against all that Marie was, all the little things that made Joseph love her all the more, he could tell that his defiance was causing them actual pain and torment… and even through the pleasures of the flesh, he took small, sadistic delights in causing pain and anguish to these assholes who claimed authority as his forbearers.Now Joseph was getting annoyed… and cranky. Look, I dont have to listen to you idiots, even if you do claim to be my ancestors. You came from a completely different world whose rules do not apply to me. Also, the instruments of your authority are gone: no money, no status, no companies or contacts or friends in high places. All thats left are a bunch of ugly little voices in the wind. Why dont you all just blow away? He was tired of his, of having to listen to these inane snobs that he had learned to loath in the abstract and now hated in the concrete. He hated their hate-filled dismissals of all other peoples and cultures, their smug superiority and the generalized arrogance that seemed to drip from the voices.When they didnt respond, Joseph took it as a sign. \"Good.\" He said aloud, as softly as his sense of satisfaction allowed.", "Rodrigo: (Laughing) \"Horror? You speak to me of horror? I have seen things which would make the gods tremble!\"Massa di Requiem per ShuggayAct II Scene IVBenevento Chieti Bordighera(Translated from the original Italian)Torren-Wraeth hated being summoned. He hated human sacrifice even more. After all, his mother had been human, but he could not act against his fathers wishes, nor those who had summoned him, at least, not directly. He was here merely to witness, to stand helpless as a life was taken.The youth stood, tall and handsome, his striking Polynesian features offset by his green skin and six slender tendrils that lined his chin and jaw. He was in a house, surrounded by black-robed humans, cult artifacts and blazing braziers. A young man lay upon a stone table, bound, screaming. Torren-Wraeth walked over to the table, regret in his glistening yellow eyes, \"Im so sorry.\" The mans bulging eyes stared past him, followed two of the cultists as they moved toward a spot near the west wall of the basement/temple, strained with terror.The worshipers began to chant, and one among them called out in a loud voice, \"For the glory of Great Cthulhu, we offer this one to The Beast Below!\"\"My father does not need sacrifices...\" Torren-Wraeth said loudly. That was true, to a point. His father did not, in fact, need sacrifices, but he did desire them. Perhaps, he could save this one... But they ignored him. He watched as the men rolled back a large stone, revealing a dark hole beneath. Ghouls? Ghouls can be reasoned with, better than some humans... He frowned, spoke louder \"I said, my father...\"Then it hit him. A noxious smell poured forth through the opening, gagging him. It was not the familiar, moldy corpse smell of ghouls, but something bizarre, like ammonia and drying blood... And there was something else, something far, far worse. Voices. Many voices. Laughing madly, weeping, screaming. Screaming such as Torren-Wraeth had never heard in his life; the horrific, hopeless shrieking of the damned.He unconsciously backed away as a huge form slithered slowly from the deepest region of the pit. Torren-Wraeth nearly vomited at the sight. It was similar in shape to a worm, blood-colored and slimy, but that was not the true horror of the thing, it was its faces... A grinning, evil human face peered from the anterior of the beast, but dozens of other anguished, maddened human faces protruded at random from its hideous form. Their eyes reflected unspeakable torment, madness, and a longing for the release of death. Some babbled or laughed senselessly, others begged for death or wept, or just screamed... So many faces, so much unholy suffering. It turned toward the sacrificial table and its occupant.At the sight the victim screamed in utter terror, but his voice was drowned out by the many voices of the thing. Torren-Wraeth had heard of such things, but had not believed, had hoped that they did not exist.The Chakota.An abomination which absorbed its victims, body and mind, leaving its unfortunate prey trapped within its hateful body, aware but helpless. The first head, the mind of the beast, was the cultist who had willingly created it, literally became the beast, the others the miserable wretches it had absorbed over the years.Torren-Wraeths body turned pale yellow with horror. He had seen so much evil and cruelty in his life, but this, this was vile beyond all reason. The Binding broke with his terror. He was free to act.His reaction was instinctive, human.He screamed, grabbed the nearest brazier, and struck at the beast with it.The Chakota itself screamed as the coals and flames struck its slimy flesh, and it was alight. Torren-Wraeth struck at it again and again, scattering flaming coal across the room, igniting tapestries and furnishings. More braziers were knocked over by the beasts own struggles and the cultists scrambling for the stairs. The stone floor grew hot, and the walls caught fire. The Chakota turned to flee toward its hole, towards cool, dark safety, but Torren-Wraeth drove the broken brazier through it like a stake, pinning it in place. There was no escape.The flames danced across the stones.As the fire raged around him, Torren-Wraeth turned to the sacrificial victim, intending to free him, but a quick glance revealed that the man was dead, his face contorted in terror. He had died of fear.In some ways, he was lucky. He wondered how many of the cultists had died in the fire, and had the brief, dark feeling that they deserved it. He pushed it from his mind.He turned his attention back to the Chakota.The beast writhed in agony. The screams grew louder, shriller, while, from some of the faces trapped within the beast, came shouts of joy and thanksgiving. Facing the flames was preferable to living within the beast...Though it was obscured by smoke and flames, Torren-Wraeth watched as the Chakota quickly shriveled and blackened, withered like a worm on a hot sidewalk.Then, there were only ashes.The fire was spreading too quickly, the heat was intense, he had to leave or risk injury himself. Torren-Wraeth teleported away, leaving the cleansing fire to its work.He returned home. Not RLyeh, but Rapa Nui, which the white men called Easter Island.He threw up, then wept...Later,Torren-Wraeth stood within an ancient quarry, partially carved Moai bearing mute witness to his words. \"No more! No more human sacrifices!\" He shouted at the top of his lungs. He didnt care about the consequences. He had ignored his conscience, his honor for too long.\"You go where you are summoned!\" Great Cthulhus telepathic voice, calling out from his body in RLyeh, registered rage at this defiance.\"Never again!\" Torren-Wraeths voice was firm. He was ashamed that he had ever been party to such a thing, and he refused to do so again. His skin was blotched with conflicting emotion, \"You dont even need sacrifices, much less intelligent ones! I wont help you commit murder, not anymore!\"\"Who are you to judge me!?\"Torren-Wraeth fell silent.Great Cthulhu sighed, his child was becoming sentimental, rebellious. It was his mothers blood, it could not be helped. Ever since he had befriended that human, he had become more like them... Still, it was a small thing. \"Very well, Torren-Wraeth, from now on you will never represent me at a sentient sacrifice again.\"The boy knelt quickly, \"Thank you, father...\"\"Do not thank me yet, I may ask something of you in return.\"And Torren-Wraeth knew without a doubt that he would."]}
{"id": "EN016", "pair": ["Mantineus-Im more Mr. Briggs, than the I this time.Disclaimer-I own nothing!I\"Im gonna burn.\"Thats when I knew it got really bad. He was always a little nuts, but that. Saying it with an innocent smile and certainty. It sent chills up my spine and I experienced a fear I have not faced in my entire life.It was at this point that I realized that he really was beyond saving.How he got like this, god only knows. Before he was admitted to my sanitarium I checked his background. It was clean. His mother and father were decently sane, as were his grandparents and siblings. I checked hospital files and came up with nothing out of the ordinary. Colds, flu, and a few scrapes. Normal for any boy.Upon his arrival I waited in my office, glancing at the anniversary clock that adorned my desk religiously. Despite its bad memory, I couldnt stand to throw it away, so in my office it has stayed. Poor Lucinda.With annoyance, I watched as an orderly struggled to seat him in a chair. He was antsy and, from what I gathered, he felt he needed to be somewhere else.\"Hello,\" I said gently, hoping to direct his attention on me so that the orderly could strap him in the chair.For my protection as well as his. On the ride here he was without a straitjacket and chipped his nails and teeth trying to escape and then from trying to fatally tear his wrists open with the aforementioned parts. God only knew what he would try to do to me if I stepped out of his line.Finally, we were alone. He thrashed about for a minute before I began.\"Hello,\" I began. \"Im your new doctor.\"From there he stared at me with eyes of steel. It unnerved me; it was like he was looking through me and saw my soul. He kept staring and my psychologists nerve was faltering. Mentally I was panicking and I wondered if, due to his stoic stare, if he was looking deeper than my outer appearance of fear.My childhood flashed before my eyes.\"So doc,\" He began, his voice was gravely and deep. \"Whats your first question?\"This took me by surprise that I had to clear my throat, tap my papers back into place, and start again.\"Yes, well. You see, Ive checked your records, Mr.-\"\"Dont say it!\" He screamed, face twisting into pure, unimaginable fear. \"They might not know Im here!\"\"Whos they?\"His snapped. As if the fearful shell broke and revealed this manic, demented smile. It seemed sadistic and menacing, yet what he said was pure jibber-jabber.\"Them, doc!\" He said. His face changed again; he was stumped. \"You mean you dont know, doc? Surely youve encountered others like me.\"\"No,\" I agreed. \"Im afraid I havent.\"He began to laugh. It was long and insane. Yet, as abruptly as it began, it ended and he could have passed for a sane person within that silent second.\"Then give up this case, doc.\" He said, a chuckle escaping his throat. \"Give it to someone who knows!\"If only I listened.IIAs the sessions progressed, I admit to feeling a slight disheartenment. He would reveal nothing of his condition other than ramblings like before. Though, one day he did something of note.He was rocking back and forth in a big, exaggerated way. He would swing forward, mumble something then swing back and shout a made up word.For example, on his first forward rock he would mumble something akin to a sneeze then shout \"Fhtagn!\" Yog-soth \"Fhtagn!\" Oz-soth \"Fhtagn!\"He then began to say another strange word, of which I surmised were names, when he stopped. He got so far as \"Nya\" when he began to giggle like a lunatic and rock his torso rapidly while repeating that strange made up word.\"Fhtagn! Fhtagn! Fhtagn!\"\"Mr.-\"He began to scream as if in agony. From previous sessions, I knew it was most likely from my trying to utter his name. But, unlike previous times where he would instantly stop, he began to sob. His face flushed crimson, his eyes became slits from whence tears began to flow.\"The Necronomicon!\" He screamed, his sobs becoming more intense. \"De…Destroy….Destroy it!\"\"What?\"\"Destroy the Necronomicon!\" He shouted, he looked a mixture of agony and rage. \"Destroy it! Destroy that damn book!\"Five minutes after that outburst he stopped. Despite the still flushed face and teary eyes, he looked as if it never happened. And with that deep, gravelly voice he spoke.\"Destroy it doc.\" The intense glare he gave me sent me flashes of hellfire and promises of pain and horror the likes of which Ill never comprehend.\"Destroy it. Dont look at it, dont read it, and-whatever you do-Dont look at the back page!\"Two sessions after that he seemed to follow back into our usual routine. That is, until our third. It was then that he said what I knew was the truth. He was gone to the sane world. And despite our other methods, they would not be enough to bring him back.\"Im gonna burn.\" He said, then, with an exaggerated nod he began. \"Yep. Im gonna burn that damn book.\"\"And why would you burn it?\" I asked.He clammed up.Miskatonic University. I have been there, of course, as a student of psychology. Hoping to better myself in understanding the people around me; a curse of a recluse, Im afraid. Though I have never heard of such a book, my curiosity had gotten the better of me and I sent a letter to the Miskatonic Library.A few days later a package arrived for me with a note. The Librarian was slightly against me looking at it, but considering my profession, she allowed it. But I was to return it within a timely manner. I did not flip through it. I cannot explain why, but I felt a sense of doom upon glancing at the ancient tome.But, at least, I had something to talk about in our next session.III\"I have the book.\" I started.His eyes picked up. He smiled like a child at Christmas morning before unwrapping his gifts. He started to shake the chair he was chained to. Rapidly he asked questions like \"You didnt read it did you?\" and \"Did you burn it? If you did, can I see the ashes?\"\"No, I didnt read it.\" I confessed. \"Nor,\" I placed the book on my desk. \"Have I burned it; as you can see.\"\"Burn it!\" He shouted. \"Burn it!\"His eyes grew wide in fear.\"Theyll be coming! They sense its presence! Its an unholy beacon! Burn it! Burn it and destroy their only chance for this world!\"\"Not yet.\" I said. \"Not until you tell me why such a normal man would succumb to madness without any reason.\"His emotions changed from frantic to anger in a flash. He started to growl and shake the chair more violently. Either it is due to the cases similar to a grandmother gaining superhuman strength when their grandchild is in danger, or perhaps they did not switch the chains and after dealing with his constant mood swings, they gave. Either way, he was free.Free and wild, like a bull, he charged towards me. I dont know what compelled me to throw the book, but I did. I threw it before he was upon it. And I know, right there, I made a mistake.For when it landed, it landed on the last page where an artists rendition of the writer was present. I stared upon it, mouth agape.\"No!\" He shouted. \"Its all over now.\" He began to sob. \"I didnt want to do this!\" He then sparked up, looking hopeful. \"Wait! Its not too late! You can still reject it! Reject the responsibility and let humanity thrive!\"\"What are you talking about?\" I managed to say.My mind was beginning to form an explanation as to why the famous \"Mad Arab\" looked like me.\"Yes, traitor, what are you talking about?\"\"Nyar…\"He cracked up. \"Nyar…\" He chuckled like a mad man.The new comer was dressed in Ancient Egyptian robes and crown. He was magnificent and regal in appearance. But another sense took over and I wanted to run away from him as quickly as possible. But something caught my eye. Without the help of hand or wind, the pages began to flip back until it reached its goal. The page prior had a picture of him as he was seen now. To the right were the bold words:Nyarlathotep: The Crawling ChaosHe turned towards me. Within those cold black eyes I could see a swirling mass, similar to a galaxy, only different. And, if I strained my ears, I swore I heard the mad playing of deranged flautists.\"Do forgive me, Abdul.\" He said. \"But…\"\"Thats not my name.\" I began. \"My name is…\"\"Not important.\" He said, cutting me off. \"What is, is who you were and who you are meant to be. Abdul Hazred, the Mad Arab and priest to both Cthulhu and Yog-Sothoth.\"Flashes of desert expanses flew by within my mind. A lone man walked alone the desert, walking through an old, abandoned city that once belonged to a reptilian race of humanoids. How he dedicated his remaining years(which was not many) to write the book of which they wanted and whos information he gained through dreams and through physical means.He died and his soul became one with Yog-Sothoth until thirty-four years ago. I was plagued with nightmares and horrible sights that now no longer fill me with dread. Though what my parents did still leaves a mark. But then again, it happened to Abdul, too.(1)\"What is needed of me, Oh mighty Nyarlathotep?\"\"No!\" He shouted, but Nyarlathotep shot him an angry glare.\"I will deal with you later.\" He turned and faced me once more. \"But for now, Abdul must be briefed on what is expected of him.\"You have written The Necronomicon rather well. But, They now wish for you to write one more piece to it. This one will explain what will happen once They are awakened and how to stop the stars from changing again. Youll receive these in dreams once more. But this time, youll receive help in the form of Mr. Briggs, there.\"He cowered in fear of his own surname.\"That is, if you need help.\"\"No,\" I said. \"I shall write this myself. Besides, you called him a traitor. He is not fit to help write such a glorious book.\"\"No!\" He shouted. He had a letter opener in his hands. He was digging through my desk while we were talking. \"He will not write the missing chapter!\"He lunged at me, but was stopped by a loud buzzing sound.\"Id run if I were you.\" Nyarlathotep said.Mr. Briggs did not heed his warning, and lunged at me once more. A Mi-go crashed through the window and grabbed him with his crab-like claws and whisked him out of my office and the sanitarium all together, being prepared for his trip to Yuggoth.\"Do not disappoint me.\" He said and vanished.------ ------1) I know, according to historians, that Abdul Hazred was actually Lovecraft. But, since hes a made up character, why not give him a made up childhood? I am not implying that he was beaten as a child!", "IV.For a decade the annals of the Whateleys sink indistinguishably into the general life of a morbid community used to their queer ways and hardened to their May-Eve and All-Hallows orgies. Twice a year they would light fires on the top of Sentinel Hill, at which times the mountain rumblings would recur with greater and greater violence; while at all seasons there were strange and portentous doings at the lonely farmhouse. In the course of time callers professed to hear sounds in the sealed upper story even when all the family were downstairs, and they wondered how swiftly or how lingeringly a cow or bullock was usually sacrificed. There was talk of a complaint to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; but nothing ever came of it, since Dunwich folk are never anxious to call the outside world’s attention to themselves.      About 1923, when Wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind, voice, stature, and bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity, a second great siege of carpentry went on at the old house. It was all inside the sealed upper part, and from bits of discarded lumber people concluded that the youth and his grandfather had knocked out all the partitions and even removed the attic floor, leaving only one vast open void between the ground story and the peaked roof. They had torn down the great central chimney, too, and fitted the rusty range with a flimsy outside tin stovepipe.      In the spring after this event Old Whateley noticed the growing number of whippoorwills that would come out of Cold Spring Glen to chirp under his window at night. He seemed to regard the circumstance as one of great significance, and told the loungers at Osborn’s that he thought his time had almost come.      “They whistle jest in tune with my breathin’ naow,” he said, “an’ I guess they’re gittin’ ready to ketch my soul. They know it’s a-goin’ aout, an’ dun’t calc’late to miss it. Yew’ll know, boys, arter I’m gone, whether they git me er not. Ef they dew, they’ll keep up a-singin’ an’ laffin’ till break o’ day. Ef they dun’t they’ll kinder quiet daown like. I expeck them an’ the souls they hunts fer hev some pretty tough tussles sometimes.”      On Lammas Night, 1924, Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury was hastily summoned by Wilbur Whateley, who had lashed his one remaining horse through the darkness and telephoned from Osborn’s in the village. He found Old Whateley in a very grave state, with a cardiac action and stertorous breathing that told of an end not far off. The shapeless albino daughter and oddly bearded grandson stood by the bedside, whilst from the vacant abyss overhead there came a disquieting suggestion of rhythmical surging or lapping, as of the waves on some level beach. The doctor, though, was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds outside; a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their endless message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps of the dying man. It was uncanny and unnatural—too much, thought Dr. Houghton, like the whole of the region he had entered so reluctantly in response to the urgent call.      Toward one o’clock Old Whateley gained consciousness, and interrupted his wheezing to choke out a few words to his grandson.      “More space, Willy, more space soon. Yew grows—an’ that grows faster. It’ll be ready to sarve ye soon, boy. Open up the gates to Yog-Sothoth with the long chant that ye’ll find on page 751 of the complete edition, an’ then put a match to the prison. Fire from airth can’t burn it nohaow.”      He was obviously quite mad. After a pause, during which the flock of whippoorwills outside adjusted their cries to the altered tempo while some indications of the strange hill noises came from afar off, he added another sentence or two.      “Feed it reg’lar, Willy, an’ mind the quantity; but dun’t let it grow too fast fer the place, fer ef it busts quarters or gits aout afore ye opens to Yog-Sothoth, it’s all over an’ no use. Only them from beyont kin make it multiply an’ work. . . . Only them, the old uns as wants to come back. . . .”      But speech gave place to gasps again, and Lavinia screamed at the way the whippoorwills followed the change. It was the same for more than an hour, when the final throaty rattle came. Dr. Houghton drew shrunken lids over the glazing grey eyes as the tumult of birds faded imperceptibly to silence. Lavinia sobbed, but Wilbur only chuckled whilst the hill noises rumbled faintly.      “They didn’t git him,” he muttered in his heavy bass voice.      Wilbur was by this time a scholar of really tremendous erudition in his one-sided way, and was quietly known by correspondence to many librarians in distant places where rare and forbidden books of old days are kept. He was more and more hated and dreaded around Dunwich because of certain youthful disappearances which suspicion laid vaguely at his door; but was always able to silence inquiry through fear or through use of that fund of old-time gold which still, as in his grandfather’s time, went forth regularly and increasingly for cattle-buying. He was now tremendously mature of aspect, and his height, having reached the normal adult limit, seemed inclined to wax beyond that figure. In 1925, when a scholarly correspondent from Miskatonic University called upon him one day and departed pale and puzzled, he was fully six and three-quarters feet tall.      Through all the years Wilbur had treated his half-deformed albino mother with a growing contempt, finally forbidding her to go to the hills with him on May-Eve and Hallowmass; and in 1926 the poor creature complained to Mamie Bishop of being afraid of him.      “They’s more abaout him as I knows than I kin tell ye, Mamie,” she said, “an’ naowadays they’s more nor what I know myself. I vaow afur Gawd, I dun’t know what he wants nor what he’s a-tryin’ to dew.”      That Hallowe’en the hill noises sounded louder than ever, and fire burned on Sentinel Hill as usual; but people paid more attention to the rhythmical screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally belated whippoorwills which seemed to be assembled near the unlighted Whateley farmhouse. After midnight their shrill notes burst into a kind of pandaemoniac cachinnation which filled all the countryside, and not until dawn did they finally quiet down. Then they vanished, hurrying southward where they were fully a month overdue. What this meant, no one could quite be certain till later. None of the country folk seemed to have died—but poor Lavinia Whateley, the twisted albino, was never seen again.      In the summer of 1927 Wilbur repaired two sheds in the farmyard and began moving his books and effects out to them. Soon afterward Earl Sawyer told the loungers at Osborn’s that more carpentry was going on in the Whateley farmhouse. Wilbur was closing all the doors and windows on the ground floor, and seemed to be taking out partitions as he and his grandfather had done upstairs four years before. He was living in one of the sheds, and Sawyer thought he seemed unusually worried and tremulous. People generally suspected him of knowing something about his mother’s disappearance, and very few ever approached his neighbourhood now. His height had increased to more than seven feet, and shewed no signs of ceasing its development."]}

An Antecedent and a Horror1.Joseph Curwen, as revealed by the rambling legends embodied in what Ward heard and unearthed, was a very astonishing, enigmatic, and obscurely horrible individual. He had fled from Salem to Providence - that universal haven of the odd, the free, and the dissenting - at the beginning of the great witchcraft panic; being in fear of accusation because of his solitary ways and queer chemical or alchemical experiments. He was a colourless-looking man of about thirty, and was soon found qualified to become a freeman of Providence; thereafter buying a home lot just north of Gregory Dexters at about the foot of Olney Street. His house was built on Stampers Hill west of the Town Street, in what later became Olney Court; and in 1761 he replaced this with a larger one, on the same site, which is still standing.      Now the first odd thing about Joseph Curwen was that he did not seem to grow much older than he had been on his arrival. He engaged in shipping enterprises, purchased wharfage near Mile-End Cove, helped rebuild the Great Bridge in 1713, and in 1723 was one of the founders of the Congregational Church on the hill; but always did he retain the nondescript aspect of a man not greatly over thirty or thirty-five. As decades mounted up, this singular quality began to excite wide notice; but Curwen always explained it by saying that he came of hardy forefathers, and practiced a simplicity of living which did not wear him out. How such simplicity could be reconciled with the inexplicable comings and goings of the secretive merchant, and with the queer gleaming of his windows at all hours of night, was not very clear to the townsfolk; and they were prone to assign other reasons for his continued youth and longevity. It was held, for the most part, that Curwens incessant mixings and boilings of chemicals had much to do with his condition. Gossip spoke of the strange substances he brought from London and the Indies on his ships or purchased in Newport, Boston, and New York; and when old Dr. Jabez Bowen came from Rehoboth and opened his apothecary shop across the Great Bridge at the Sign of the Unicorn and Mortar, there was ceaseless talk of the drugs, acids, and metals that the taciturn recluse incessantly bought or ordered from him. Acting on the assumption that Curwen possessed a wondrous and secret medical skill, many sufferers of various sorts applied to him for aid; but though he appeared to encourage their belief in a non-committal way, and always gave them odd-coloured potions in response to their requests, it was observed that his ministrations to others seldom proved of benefit. At length, when over fifty years had passed since the strangers advent, and without producing more than five years apparent change in his face and physique, the people began to whisper more darkly; and to meet more than half way that desire for isolation which he had always shewn.      Private letters and diaries of the period reveal, too, a multitude of other reasons why Joseph Curwen was marvelled at, feared, and finally shunned like a plague. His passion for graveyards, in which he was glimpsed at all hours and under all conditions, was notorious; though no one had witnessed any deed on his part which could actually be termed ghoulish. On the Pawtuxet Road he had a farm, at which he generally lived during the summer, and to which he would frequently be seen riding at various odd times of the day or night. Here his only visible servants, farmers, and caretakers were a sullen pair of aged Narragansett Indians; the husband dumb and curiously scarred, and the wife of a very repulsive cast of countenance, probably due to a mixture of negro blood. In the lean-to of this house was the laboratory where most of the chemical experiments were conducted. Curious porters and teamers who delivered bottles, bags, or boxes at the small rear door would exchange accounts of the fantastic flasks, crucibles, alembics, and furnaces they saw in the low shelved room; and prophesied in whispers that the close-mouthed \"chymist\" - by which they meant alchemist - would not be long in finding the Philosophers Stone. The nearest neighbours to this farm - the Fenners, a quarter of a mile away - had still queerer things to tell of certain sounds which they insisted came from the Curwen place in the night. There were cries, they said, and sustained howlings; and they did not like the large number of livestock which thronged the pastures, for no such amount was needed to keep a lone old man and a very few servants in meat, milk, and wool. The identity of the stock seemed to change from week to week as new droves were purchased from the Kingstown farmers. Then, too, there was something very obnoxious about a certain great stone outbuilding with only high narrow slits for windows.      Great Bridge idlers likewise had much to say of Curwens town house in Olney Court; not so much the fine new one built in 1761, when the man must have been nearly a century old, but the first low gambrel-roofed one with the windowless attic and shingled sides, whose timbers he took the peculiar precaution of burning after its demolition. Here there was less mystery, it is true; but the hours at which lights were seen, the secretiveness of the two swarthy foreigners who comprised the only menservants, the hideous indistinct mumbling of the incredibly aged French housekeeper, the large amounts of food seen to enter a door within which only four persons lived, and the quality of certain voices often heard in muffled conversation at highly unseasonable times, all combined with what was known of the Pawtuxet farm to give the place a bad name.      In choicer circles, too, the Curwen home was by no means undiscussed; for as the newcomer had gradually worked into the church and trading life of the town, he had naturally made acquaintances of the better sort, whose company and conversation he was well fitted by education to enjoy. His birth was known to be good, since the Curwens or Corwins of Salem needed no introduction in New England. It developed that Joseph Curwen had travelled much in very early life, living for a time in England and making at least two voyages to the Orient; and his speech, when he deigned to use it, was that of a learned and cultivated Englishman. But for some reason or other Curwen did not care for society. Whilst never actually rebuffing a visitor, he always reared such a wall of reserve that few could think of anything to say to him which would not sound inane.      There seemed to lurk in his bearing some cryptic, sardonic arrogance, as if he had come to find all human beings dull through having moved among stranger and more potent entities. When Dr. Checkley the famous wit came from Boston in 1738 to be rector of Kings Church, he did not neglect calling on one of whom he soon heard so much; but left in a very short while because of some sinister undercurrent he detected in his hosts discourse. Charles Ward told his father, when they discussed Curwen one winter evening, that he would give much to learn what the mysterious old man had said to the sprightly cleric, but that all diarists agree concerning Dr. Checkleys reluctance to repeat anything he had heard. The good man had been hideously shocked, and could never recall Joseph Curwen without a visible loss of the gay urbanity for which he was famed.      More definite, however, was the reason why another man of taste and breeding avoided the haughty hermit. In 1746 Mr. John Merritt, an elderly English gentleman of literary and scientific leanings, came from Newport to the town which was so rapidly overtaking it in standing, and built a fine country seat on the Neck in what is now the heart of the best residence section. He lived in considerable style and comfort, keeping the first coach and liveried servants in town, and taking great pride in his telescope, his microscope, and his well-chosen library of English and Latin books. Hearing of Curwen as the owner of the best library in Providence, Mr. Merritt early paid him a call, and was more cordially received than most other callers at the house had been. His admiration for his hosts ample shelves, which besides the Greek, Latin, and English classics were equipped with a remarkable battery of philosophical, mathematical, and scientific works including Paracelsus, Agricola, Van Helmont, Sylvius, Glauber, Boyle, Boerhaave, Becher, and Stahl, led Curwen to suggest a visit to the farmhouse and laboratory whither he had never invited anyone before; and the two drove out at once in Mr. Merritts coach.      Mr. Merritt always confessed to seeing nothing really horrible at the farmhouse, but maintained that the titles of the books in the special library of thaumaturgical, alchemical, and theological subjects which Curwen kept in a front room were alone sufficient to inspire him with a lasting loathing. Perhaps, however, the facial expression of the owner in exhibiting them contributed much of the prejudice. The bizarre collection, besides a host of standard works which Mr. Merritt was not too alarmed to envy, embraced nearly all the cabbalists, daemonologists, and magicians known to man; and was a treasure-house of lore in the doubtful realms of alchemy and astrology. Hermes Trismegistus in Mesnards edition, the Turba Philosophorum, Gebers Liber Investigationis, and Artephius Key of Wisdom all were there; with the cabbalistic Zohar, Peter Jammys set of Albertus Magnus, Raymond Lullys Ars Magna et Ultima in Zetzners edition, Roger Bacons Thesaurus Chemicus, Fludds Clavis Alchimiae, and Trithemius De Lapide Philosophico crowding them close. Mediaeval Jews and Arabs were represented in profusion, and Mr. Merritt turned pale when, upon taking down a fine volume conspicuously labelled as the Qanoon-e-Islam, he found it was in truth the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred, of which he had heard such monstrous things whispered some years previously after the exposure of nameless rites at the strange little fishing village of Kingsport, in the Province of the Massachusetts-Bay.      But oddly enough, the worthy gentleman owned himself most impalpably disquieted by a mere minor detail. On the huge mahogany table there lay face downward a badly worn copy of Borellus, bearing many cryptical marginalia and interlineations in Curwens hand. The book was open at about its middle, and one paragraph displayed such thick and tremulous pen-strokes beneath the lines of mystic black-letter that the visitor could not resist scanning it through. Whether it was the nature of the passage underscored, or the feverish heaviness of the strokes which formed the underscoring, he could not tell; but something in that combination affected him very badly and very peculiarly. He recalled it to the end of his days, writing it down from memory in his diary and once trying to recite it to his close friend Dr. Checkley till he saw how greatly it disturbed the urbane rector. It read:      \"The essential Saltes of Animals may be so prepared and preserved, that an ingenious Man may have the whole Ark of Noah in his own Studie, and raise the fine Shape of an Animal out of its Ashes at his Pleasure; and by the lyke Method from the essential Saltes of humane Dust, a Philosopher may, without any criminal Necromancy, call up the Shape of any dead Ancestour from the Dust whereinto his Bodie has been incinerated.\"      It was near the docks along the southerly part of the Town Street, however, that the worst things were muttered about Joseph Curwen. Sailors are superstitious folk; and the seasoned salts who manned the infinite rum, slave, and molasses sloops, the rakish privateers, and the great brigs of the Browns, Crawfords, and Tillinghasts, all made strange furtive signs of protection when they saw the slim, deceptively young-looking figure with its yellow hair and slight stoop entering the Curwen warehouse in Doubloon Street or talking with captains and supercargoes on the long quay where the Curwen ships rode restlessly. Curwens own clerks and captains hated and feared him, and all his sailors were mongrel riff-raff from Martinique, St. Eustatius, Havana, or Port Royal. It was, in a way, the frequency with which these sailors were replaced which inspired the acutest and most tangible part of the fear in which the old man was held. A crew would be turned loose in the town on shore leave, some of its members perhaps charged with this errand or that; and when reassembled it would be almost sure to lack one or more men. That many of the errands had concerned the farm on the Pawtuxet Road, and that few of the sailors had ever been seen to return from that place, was not forgotten; so that in time it became exceedingly difficult for Curwen to keep his oddly assorted hands. Almost invariably several would desert soon after hearing the gossip of the Providence wharves, and their replacement in the West Indies became an increasingly great problem to the merchant.      In 1760 Joseph Curwen was virtually an outcast, suspected of vague horrors and daemoniac alliances which seemed all the more menacing because they could not be named, understood, or even proved to exist. The last straw may have come from the affair of the missing soldiers in 1758, for in March and April of that year two Royal regiments on their way to New France were quartered in Providence, and depleted by an inexplicable process far beyond the average rate of desertion. Rumour dwelt on the frequency with which Curwen was wont to be seen talking with the red-coated strangers; and as several of them began to be missed, people thought of the odd conditions among his own seamen. What would have happened if the regiments had not been ordered on, no one can tell.      Meanwhile the merchants worldly affairs were prospering. He had a virtual monopoly of the towns trade in saltpetre, black pepper, and cinnamon, and easily led any other one shipping establishment save the Browns in his importation of brassware, indigo, cotton, woollens, salt, rigging, iron, paper, and English goods of every kind. Such shopkeepers as James Green, at the Sign of the Elephant in Cheapside, the Russells, at the Sign of the Golden Eagle across the Bridge, or Clark and Nightingale at the Frying-Pan and Fish near the New Coffee-House, depended almost wholly upon him for their stock; and his arrangements with the local distillers, the Narragansett dairymen and horse-breeders, and the Newport candle-makers, made him one of the prime exporters of the Colony.      Ostracised though he was, he did not lack for civic spirit of a sort. When the Colony House burned down, he subscribed handsomely to the lotteries by which the new brick one - still standing at the head of its parade in the old main street - was built in 1761. In that same year, too, he helped rebuild the Great Bridge after the October gale. He replaced many of the books of the public library consumed in the Colony House fire, and bought heavily in the lottery that gave the muddy Market Parade and deep-rutted Town Street their pavement of great round stones with a brick footwalk or \"causey\" in the middle. About this time, also, he built the plain but excellent new house whose doorway is still such a triumph of carving. When the Whitefield adherents broke off from Dr. Cottons hill church in 1743 and founded Deacon Snows church across the Bridge, Curwen had gone with them; though his zeal and attendance soon abated. Now, however, he cultivated piety once more; as if to dispel the shadow which had thrown him into isolation and would soon begin to wreck his business fortunes if not sharply checked.2.      The sight of this strange, pallid man, hardly middle-aged in aspect yet certainly not less than a full century old, seeking at last to emerge from a cloud of fright and detestation too vague to pin down or analyse, was at once a pathetic, a dramatic, and a contemptible thing. Such is the power of wealth and of surface gestures, however, that there came indeed a slight abatement in the visible aversion displayed toward him; especially after the rapid disappearances of his sailors abruptly ceased. He must likewise have begun to practice an extreme care and secrecy in his graveyard expeditions, for he was never again caught at such wanderings; whilst the rumours of uncanny sounds and manoeuvres at his Pawtuxet farm diminished in proportion. His rate of food consumption and cattle replacement remained abnormally high; but not until modern times, when Charles Ward examined a set of his accounts and invoices in the Shepley Library, did it occur to any person - save one embittered youth, perhaps - to make dark comparisons between the large number of Guinea blacks he imported until 1766, and the disturbingly small number for whom he could produce bona fide bills of sale either to slave-dealers at the Great Bridge or to the planters of the Narragansett Country. Certainly, the cunning and ingenuity of this abhorred character were uncannily profound, once the necessity for their exercise had become impressed upon him.      But of course the effect of all this belated mending was necessarily slight. Curwen continued to be avoided and distrusted, as indeed the one fact of his continued air of youth at a great age would have been enough to warrant; and he could see that in the end his fortunes would be likely to suffer. His elaborate studies and experiments, whatever they may have been, apparently required a heavy income for their maintenance; and since a change of environment would deprive him of the trading advantages he had gained, it would not have profited him to begin anew in a different region just then. Judgment demanded that he patch up his relations with the townsfolk of Providence, so that his presence might no longer be a signal for hushed conversation, transparent excuses of errands elsewhere, and a general atmosphere of constraint and uneasiness. His clerks, being now reduced to the shiftless and impecunious residue whom no one else would employ, were giving him much worry; and he held to his sea-captains and mates only by shrewdness in gaining some kind of ascendancy over them - a mortgage, a promissory note, or a bit of information very pertinent to their welfare. In many cases, diarists have recorded with some awe, Curwen shewed almost the power of a wizard in unearthing family secrets for questionable use. During the final five years of his life it seemed as though only direct talks with the long-dead could possibly have furnished some of the data which he had so glibly at his tongues end.      About this time the crafty scholar hit upon a last desperate expedient to regain his footing in the community. Hitherto a complete hermit, he now determined to contract an advantageous marriage; securing as a bride some lady whose unquestioned position would make all ostracism of his home impossible. It may be that he also had deeper reasons for wishing an alliance; reasons so far outside the known cosmic sphere that only papers found a century and a half after his death caused anyone to suspect them; but of this nothing certain can ever be learned. Naturally he was aware of the horror and indignation with which any ordinary courtship of his would be received, hence he looked about for some likely candidate upon whose parents he might exert a suitable pressure. Such candidates, he found, were not at all easy to discover; since he had very particular requirements in the way of beauty, accomplishments, and social security. At length his survey narrowed down to the household of one of his best and oldest ship-captains, a widower of high birth and unblemished standing named Dutee Tillinghast, whose only daughter Eliza seemed dowered with every conceivable advantage save prospects as an heiress. Capt. Tillinghast was completely under the domination of Curwen; and consented, after a terrible interview in his cupolaed house on Powers Lane hill, to sanction the blasphemous alliance.      Eliza Tillinghast was at that time eighteen years of age, and had been reared as gently as the reduced circumstances of her father permitted. She had attended Stephen Jacksons school opposite the Court-House Parade; and had been diligently instructed by her mother, before the latters death of smallpox in 1757, in all the arts and refinements of domestic life. A sampler of hers, worked in 1753 at the age of nine, may still be found in the rooms of the Rhode Island Historical Society. After her mothers death she had kept the house, aided only by one old black woman. Her arguments with her father concerning the proposed Curwen marriage must have been painful indeed; but of these we have no record. Certain it is that her engagement to young Ezra Weeden, second mate of the Crawford packet Enterprise, was dutifully broken off, and that her union with Joseph Curwen took place on the seventh of March, 1763, in the Baptist church, in the presence of one of the most distinguished assemblages which the town could boast; the ceremony being performed by the younger Samuel Winsor. The Gazette mentioned the event very briefly, and in most surviving copies the item in question seems to be cut or torn out. Ward found a single intact copy after much search in the archives of a private collector of note, observing with amusement the meaningless urbanity of the language:      \"Monday evening last, Mr. Joseph Curwen, of this Town, Merchant, was married to Miss Eliza Tillinghast, Daughter of Capt. Dutee Tillinghast, a young Lady who has real Merit, added to a beautiful Person, to grace the connubial State and perpetuate its Felicity.\"      The collection of Durfee-Arnold letters, discovered by Charles Ward shortly before his first reputed madness in the private collection of Melville F. Peters, Esq., of George St., and covering this and a somewhat antecedent period, throws vivid light on the outrage done to public sentiment by this ill-assorted match. The social influence of the Tillinghasts, however, was not to be denied; and once more Joseph Curwen found his house frequented by persons whom he could never otherwise have induced to cross his threshold. His acceptance was by no means complete, and his bride was socially the sufferer through her forced venture; but at all events the wall of utter ostracism was somewhat worn down. In his treatment of his wife the strange bridegroom astonished both her and the community by displaying an extreme graciousness and consideration. The new house in Olney Court was now wholly free from disturbing manifestations, and although Curwen was much absent at the Pawtuxet farm which his wife never visited, he seemed more like a normal citizen than at any other time in his long years of residence. Only one person remained in open enmity with him, this being the youthful ships officer whose engagement to Eliza Tillinghast had been so abruptly broken. Ezra Weeden had frankly vowed vengeance; and though of a quiet and ordinarily mild disposition, was now gaining a hate-bred, dogged purpose which boded no good to the usurping husband.      On the seventh of May, 1765, Curwens only child Ann was born; and was christened by the Rev. John Graves of Kings Church, of which both husband and wife had become communicants shortly after their marriage, in order to compromise between their respective Congregational and Baptist affiliations. The record of this birth, as well as that of the marriage two years before, was stricken from most copies of the church and town annals where it ought to appear; and Charles Ward located both with the greatest difficulty after his discovery of the widows change of name had apprised him of his own relationship, and engendered the feverish interest which culminated in his madness. The birth entry, indeed, was found very curiously through correspondence with the heirs of the loyalist Dr. Graves, who had taken with him a duplicate set of records when he left his pastorate at the outbreak of the Revolution. Ward had tried this source because he knew that his great-great-grandmother Ann Tillinghast Potter had been an Episcopalian.      Shortly after the birth of his daughter, an event he seemed to welcome with a fervour greatly out of keeping with his usual coldness, Curwen resolved to sit for a portrait. This he had painted by a very gifted Scotsman named Cosmo Alexander, then a resident of Newport, and since famous as the early teacher of Gilbert Stuart. The likeness was said to have been executed on a wall-panel of the library of the house in Olney Court, but neither of the two old diaries mentioning it gave any hint of its ultimate disposition. At this period the erratic scholar shewed signs of unusual abstraction, and spent as much time as he possibly could at his farm on the Pawtuxet Road. He seemed, it was stated, in a condition of suppressed excitement or suspense; as if expecting some phenomenal thing or on the brink of some strange discovery. Chemistry or alchemy would appear to have played a great part, for he took from his house to the farm the greater number of his volumes on that subject.      His affectation of civic interest did not diminish, and he lost no opportunities for helping such leaders as Stephen Hopkins, Joseph Brown, and Benjamin West in their efforts to raise the cultural tone of the town, which was then much below the level of Newport in its patronage of the liberal arts. He had helped Daniel Jenckes found his bookshop in 1763, and was thereafter his best customer; extending aid likewise to the struggling Gazette that appeared each Wednesday at the Sign of Shakespears Head. In politics he ardently supported Governor Hopkins against the Ward party whose prime strength was in Newport, and his really eloquent speech at Hackers Hall in 1765 against the setting off of North Providence as a separate town with a pro-Ward vote in the General Assembly did more than any other one thing to wear down the prejudice against him. But Ezra Weeden, who watched him closely, sneered cynically at all this outward activity; and freely swore it was no more than a mask for some nameless traffick with the blackest gulfs of Tartarus. The revengeful youth began a systematic study of the man and his doings whenever he was in port; spending hours at night by the wharves with a dory in readiness when he saw lights in the Curwen warehouses, and following the small boat which would sometimes steal quietly off and down the bay. He also kept as close a watch as possible on the Pawtuxet farm, and was once severely bitten by the dogs the old Indian couple loosed upon him.3.      In 1766 came the final change in Joseph Curwen. It was very sudden, and gained wide notice amongst the curious townsfolk; for the air of suspense and expectancy dropped like an old cloak, giving instant place to an ill-concealed exaltation of perfect triumph. Curwen seemed to have difficulty in restraining himself from public harangues on what he had found or learned or made; but apparently the need of secrecy was greater than the longing to share his rejoicing, for no explanation was ever offered by him. It was after this transition, which appears to have come early in July, that the sinister scholar began to astonish people by his possession of information which only their long-dead ancestors would seem to be able to impart.      But Curwens feverish secret activities by no means ceased with this change. On the contrary, they tended rather to increase; so that more and more of his shipping business was handled by the captains whom he now bound to him by ties of fear as potent as those of bankruptcy had been. He altogether abandoned the slave trade, alleging that its profits were constantly decreasing. Every possible moment was spent at the Pawtuxet farm; though there were rumours now and then of his presence in places which, though not actually near graveyards, were yet so situated in relation to graveyards that thoughtful people wondered just how thorough the old merchants change of habits really was. Ezra Weeden, though his periods of espionage were necessarily brief and intermittent on account of his sea voyaging, had a vindictive persistence which the bulk of the practical townsfolk and farmers lacked; and subjected Curwens affairs to a scrutiny such as they had never had before.      Many of the odd manoeuvres of the strange merchants vessels had been taken for granted on account of the unrest of the times, when every colonist seemed determined to resist the provisions of the Sugar Act which hampered a prominent traffick. Smuggling and evasion were the rule in Narragansett Bay, and nocturnal landings of illicit cargoes were continuous commonplaces. But Weeden, night after night following the lighters or small sloops which he saw steal off from the Curwen warehouses at the Town Street docks, soon felt assured that it was not merely His Majestys armed ships which the sinister skulker was anxious to avoid. Prior to the change in 1766 these boats had for the most part contained chained negroes, who were carried down and across the bay and landed at an obscure point on the shore just north of Pawtuxet; being afterward driven up the bluff and across country to the Curwen farm, where they were locked in that enormous stone outbuilding which had only high narrow slits for windows. After that change, however, the whole programme was altered. Importation of slaves ceased at once, and for a time Curwen abandoned his midnight sailings. Then, about the spring of 1767, a new policy appeared. Once more the lighters grew wont to put out from the black, silent docks, and this time they would go down the bay some distance, perhaps as far as Namquit Point, where they would meet and receive cargo from strange ships of considerable size and widely varied appearance. Curwens sailors would then deposit this cargo at the usual point on the shore, and transport it overland to the farm; locking it in the same cryptical stone building which had formerly received the negroes. The cargo consisted almost wholly of boxes and cases, of which a large proportion were oblong and heavy and disturbingly suggestive of coffins.      Weeden always watched the farm with unremitting assiduity; visiting it each night for long periods, and seldom letting a week go by without a sight except when the ground bore a footprint-revealing snow. Even then he would often walk as close as possible in the travelled road or on the ice of the neighbouring river to see what tracks others might have left. Finding his own vigils interrupted by nautical duties, he hired a tavern companion named Eleazar Smith to continue the survey during his absences; and between them the two could have set in motion some extraordinary rumours. That they did not do so was only because they knew the effect of publicity would be to warn their quarry and make further progress impossible. Instead, they wished to learn something definite before taking any action. What they did learn must have been startling indeed, and Charles Ward spoke many times to his parents of his regret at Weedens later burning of his notebooks. All that can be told of their discoveries is what Eleazar Smith jotted down in a none too coherent diary, and what other diarists and letter-writers have timidly repeated from the statements which they finally made - and according to which the farm was only the outer shell of some vast and revolting menace, of a scope and depth too profound and intangible for more than shadowy comprehension.      It is gathered that Weeden and Smith became early convinced that a great series of tunnels and catacombs, inhabited by a very sizeable staff of persons besides the old Indian and his wife, underlay the farm. The house was an old peaked relic of the middle seventeenth century with enormous stack chimney and diamond-paned lattice windows, the laboratory being in a lean-to toward the north, where the roof came nearly to the ground. This building stood clear of any other; yet judging by the different voices heard at odd times within, it must have been accessible through secret passages beneath. These voices, before 1766, were mere mumblings and negro whisperings and frenzied screams, coupled with curious chants or invocations. After that date, however, they assumed a very singular and terrible cast as they ran the gamut betwixt dronings of dull acquiescence and explosions of frantic pain or fury, rumblings of conversation and whines of entreaty, pantings of eagerness and shouts of protest. They appeared to be in different languages, all known to Curwen, whose rasping accents were frequently distinguishable in reply, reproof, or threatening. Sometimes it seemed that several persons must be in the house; Curwen, certain captives, and the guards of those captives. There were voices of a sort that neither Weeden nor Smith had ever heard before despite their wide knowledge of foreign parts, and many that they did seem to place as belonging to this or that nationality. The nature of the conversations seemed always a kind of catechism, as if Curwen were extorting some sort of information from terrified or rebellious prisoners.      Weeden had many verbatim reports of overheard scraps in his notebook, for English, French, and Spanish, which he knew, were frequently used; but of these nothing has survived. He did, however, say that besides a few ghoulish dialogues in which the past affairs of Providence families were concerned, most of the questions and answers he could understand were historical or scientific; occasionally pertaining to very remote places and ages. Once, for example, an alternately raging and sullen figure was questioned in French about the Black Princes massacre at Limoges in 1370, as if there were some hidden reason which he ought to know. Curwen asked the prisoner - if prisoner it were - whether the order to slay was given because of the Sign of the Goat found on the altar in the ancient Roman crypt beneath the Cathedral, or whether the Dark Man of the Haute Vienne Coven had spoken the Three Words. Failing to obtain replies, the inquisitor had seemingly resorted to extreme means; for there was a terrific shriek followed by silence and muttering and a bumping sound.      None of these colloquies were ever ocularly witnessed, since the windows were always heavily draped. Once, though, during a discourse in an unknown tongue, a shadow was seen on the curtain which startled Weeden exceedingly; reminding him of one of the puppets in a show he had seen in the autumn of 1764 in Hackers Hall, when a man from Germantown, Pennsylvania, had given a clever mechanical spectacle advertised as a \"View of the Famous City of Jerusalem, in which are represented Jerusalem, the Temple of Solomon, his Royal Throne, the noted Towers, and Hills, likewise the Sufferings of Our Saviour from the Garden of Gethsemane to the Cross on the Hill of Golgotha; an artful piece of Statuary, Worthy to be seen by the Curious.\" It was on this occasion that the listener, who had crept close to the window of the front room whence the speaking proceeded, gave a start which roused the old Indian pair and caused them to loose the dogs on him. After that no more conversations were ever heard in the house, and Weeden and Smith concluded that Curwen had transferred his field of action to regions below.      That such regions in truth existed, seemed amply clear from many things. Faint cries and groans unmistakably came up now and then from what appeared to be the solid earth in places far from any structure; whilst hidden in the bushes along the river-bank in the rear, where the high ground sloped steeply down to the valley of the Pawtuxet, there was found an arched oaken door in a frame of heavy masonry, which was obviously an entrance to caverns within the hill. When or how these catacombs could have been constructed, Weeden was unable to say; but he frequently pointed out how easily the place might have been reached by bands of unseen workmen from the river. Joseph Curwen put his mongrel seamen to diverse uses indeed! During the heavy spring rains of 1769 the two watchers kept a sharp eye on the steep river-bank to see if any subterrene secrets might be washed to light, and were rewarded by the sight of a profusion of both human and animal bones in places where deep gullies had been worn in the banks. Naturally there might be many explanations of such things in the rear of a stock farm, and in a locality where old Indian burying-grounds were common, but Weeden and Smith drew their own inferences.      It was in January 1770, whilst Weeden and Smith were still debating vainly on what, if anything, to think or do about the whole bewildering business, that the incident of the Fortaleza occurred. Exasperated by the burning of the revenue sloop Liberty at Newport during the previous summer, the customs fleet under Admiral Wallace had adopted an increased vigilance concerning strange vessels; and on this occasion His Majestys armed schooner Cygnet, under Capt. Charles Leslie, captured after a short pursuit one early morning the snow Fortaleza of Barcelona, Spain, under Capt. Manuel Arruda, bound according to its log from Grand Cairo, Egypt, to Providence. When searched for contraband material, this ship revealed the astonishing fact that its cargo consisted exclusively of Egyptian mummies, consigned to \"Sailor A. B. C.\", who would come to remove his goods in a lighter just off Namquit Point and whose identity Capt. Arruda felt himself in honour bound not to reveal. The Vice-Admiralty Court at Newport, at a loss what to do in view of the non-contraband nature of the cargo on the one hand and of the unlawful secrecy of the entry on the other hand, compromised on Collector Robinsons recommendation by freeing the ship but forbidding it a port in Rhode Island waters. There were later rumours of its having been seen in Boston Harbour, though it never openly entered the Port of Boston.      This extraordinary incident did not fail of wide remark in Providence, and there were not many who doubted the existence of some connexion between the cargo of mummies and the sinister Joseph Curwen. His exotic studies and his curious chemical importations being common knowledge, and his fondness for graveyards being common suspicion; it did not take much imagination to link him with a freakish importation which could not conceivably have been destined for anyone else in the town. As if conscious of this natural belief, Curwen took care to speak casually on several occasions of the chemical value of the balsams found in mummies; thinking perhaps that he might make the affair seem less unnatural, yet stopping just short of admitting his participation. Weeden and Smith, of course, felt no doubt whatsoever of the significance of the thing; and indulged in the wildest theories concerning Curwen and his monstrous labours.      The following spring, like that of the year before, had heavy rains; and the watchers kept careful track of the river-bank behind the Curwen farm. Large sections were washed away, and a certain number of bones discovered; but no glimpse was afforded of any actual subterranean chambers or burrows. Something was rumoured, however, at the village of Pawtuxet about a mile below, where the river flows in falls over a rocky terrace to join the placid landlocked cove. There, where quaint old cottages climbed the hill from the rustic bridge, and fishing-smacks lay anchored at their sleepy docks, a vague report went round of things that were floating down the river and flashing into sight for a minute as they went over the falls. Of course the Pawtuxet is a long river which winds through many settled regions abounding in graveyards, and of course the spring rains had been very heavy; but the fisherfolk about the bridge did not like the wild way that one of the things stared as it shot down to the still water below, or the way that another half cried out although its condition had greatly departed from that of objects which normally cry out. That rumour sent Smith - for Weeden was just then at sea - in haste to the river-bank behind the farm; where surely enough there remained the evidences of an extensive cave-in. There was, however, no trace of a passage into the steep bank; for the miniature avalanche had left behind a solid wall of mixed earth and shrubbery from aloft. Smith went to the extent of some experimental digging, but was deterred by lack of success - or perhaps by fear of possible success. It is interesting to speculate on what the persistent and revengeful Weeden would have done had he been ashore at the time.4.      By the autumn of 1770 Weeden decided that the time was ripe to tell others of his discoveries; for he had a large number of facts to link together, and a second eye-witness to refute the possible charge that jealousy and vindictiveness had spurred his fancy. As his first confidant he selected Capt. James Mathewson of the Enterprise, who on the one hand knew him well enough not to doubt his veracity, and on the other hand was sufficiently influential in the town to be heard in turn with respect. The colloquy took place in an upper room of Sabins Tavern near the docks, with Smith present to corroborate virtually every statement; and it could be seen that Capt. Mathewson was tremendously impressed. Like nearly everyone else in the town, he had had black suspicions of his own anent Joseph Curwen; hence it needed only this confirmation and enlargement of data to convince him absolutely. At the end of the conference he was very grave, and enjoined strict silence upon the two younger men. He would, he said, transmit the information separately to some ten or so of the most learned and prominent citizens of Providence; ascertaining their views and following whatever advice they might have to offer. Secrecy would probably be essential in any case, for this was no matter that the town constables or militia could cope with; and above all else the excitable crowd must be kept in ignorance, lest there be enacted in these already troublous times a repetition of that frightful Salem panic of less than a century before which had first brought Curwen hither.      The right persons to tell, he believed, would be Dr. Benjamin West, whose pamphlet on the late transit of Venus proved him a scholar and keen thinker; Rev. James Manning, President of the College which had just moved up from Warren and was temporarily housed in the new King Street schoolhouse awaiting the completion of its building on the hill above Presbyterian-Lane; ex-Governor Stephen Hopkins, who had been a member of the Philosophical Society at Newport, and was a man of very broad perceptions; John Carter, publisher of the Gazette; all four of the Brown brothers, John, Joseph, Nicholas, and Moses, who formed the recognised local magnates, and of whom Joseph was an amateur scientist of parts; old Dr. Jabez Bowen, whose erudition was considerable, and who had much first-hand knowledge of Curwens odd purchases; and Capt. Abraham Whipple, a privateersman of phenomenal boldness and energy who could be counted on to lead in any active measures needed. These men, if favourable, might eventually be brought together for collective deliberation; and with them would rest the responsibility of deciding whether or not to inform the Governor of the Colony, Joseph Wanton of Newport, before taking action.      The mission of Capt. Mathewson prospered beyond his highest expectations; for whilst he found one or two of the chosen confidants somewhat sceptical of the possible ghastly side of Weedens tale, there was not one who did not think it necessary to take some sort of secret and cordinated action. Curwen, it was clear, formed a vague potential menace to the welfare of the town and Colony; and must be eliminated at any cost. Late in December 1770 a group of eminent townsmen met at the home of Stephen Hopkins and debated tentative measures. Weedens notes, which he had given to Capt. Mathewson, were carefully read; and he and Smith were summoned to give testimony anent details. Something very like fear seized the whole assemblage before the meeting was over, though there ran through that fear a grim determination which Capt. Whipples bluff and resonant profanity best expressed. They would not notify the Governor, because a more than legal course seemed necessary. With hidden powers of uncertain extent apparently at his disposal, Curwen was not a man who could safely be warned to leave town. Nameless reprisals might ensue, and even if the sinister creature complied, the removal would be no more than the shifting of an unclean burden to another place. The times were lawless, and men who had flouted the Kings revenue forces for years were not the ones to balk at sterner things when duty impelled. Curwen must be surprised at his Pawtuxet farm by a large raiding-party of seasoned privateersmen and given one decisive chance to explain himself. If he proved a madman, amusing himself with shrieks and imaginary conversations in different voices, he would be properly confined. If something graver appeared, and if the underground horrors indeed turned out to be real, he and all with him must die. It could be done quietly, and even the widow and her father need not be told how it came about.      While these serious steps were under discussion there occurred in the town an incident so terrible and inexplicable that for a time little else was mentioned for miles around. In the middle of a moonlight January night with heavy snow underfoot there resounded over the river and up the hill a shocking series of cries which brought sleepy heads to every window; and people around Weybosset Point saw a great white thing plunging frantically along the badly cleared space in front of the Turks Head. There was a baying of dogs in the distance, but this subsided as soon as the clamour of the awakened town became audible. Parties of men with lanterns and muskets hurried out to see what was happening, but nothing rewarded their search. The next morning, however, a giant, muscular body, stark naked, was found on the jams of ice around the southern piers of the Great Bridge, where the Long Dock stretched out beside Abbotts distil-house, and the identity of this object became a theme for endless speculation and whispering. It was not so much the younger as the older folk who whispered, for only in the patriarchs did that rigid face with horror-bulging eyes strike any chord of memory. They, shaking as they did so, exchanged furtive murmurs of wonder and fear; for in those stiff, hideous features lay a resemblance so marvellous as to be almost an identity - and that identity was with a man who had died full fifty years before.      Ezra Weeden was present at the finding; and remembering the baying of the night before, set out along Weybosset Street and across Muddy Dock Bridge whence the sound had come. He had a curious expectancy, and was not surprised when, reaching the edge of the settled district where the street merged into the Pawtuxet Road, he came upon some very curious tracks in the snow. The naked giant had been pursued by dogs and many booted men, and the returning tracks of the hounds and their masters could be easily traced. They had given up the chase upon coming too near the town. Weeden smiled grimly, and as a perfunctory detail traced the footprints back to their source. It was the Pawtuxet farm of Joseph Curwen, as he well knew it would be; and he would have given much had the yard been less confusingly trampled. As it was, he dared not seem too interested in full daylight. Dr. Bowen, to whom Weeden went at once with his report, performed an autopsy on the strange corpse, and discovered peculiarities which baffled him utterly. The digestive tracts of the huge man seemed never to have been in use, whilst the whole skin had a coarse, loosely knit texture impossible to account for. Impressed by what the old men whispered of this bodys likeness to the long-dead blacksmith Daniel Green, whose great-grandson Aaron Hoppin was a supercargo in Curwens employ, Weeden asked casual questions till he found where Green was buried. That night a party of ten visited the old North Burying Ground opposite Herrendens Lane and opened a grave. They found it vacant, precisely as they had expected.      Meanwhile arrangements had been made with the post riders to intercept Joseph Curwens mail, and shortly before the incident of the naked body there was found a letter from one Jedediah Orne of Salem which made the coperating citizens think deeply. Parts of it, copied and preserved in the private archives of the Smith family where Charles Ward found it, ran as follows:      \"I delight that you continue in ye Gettg at Olde Matters in your Way, and doe not think better was done at Mr. Hutchinsons in Salem-Village. Certainely, there was Nothg butt ye liveliest Awfulness in that which H. raisd upp from What he coud gather onlie a part of. What you sente, did not Worke, whether because of Any Thing missg, or because ye Wordes were not Righte from my Speakg or yr Copyg. I alone am at a Loss. I have not ye Chymicall art to followe Borellus, and owne my Self confounded by ye VII. Booke of ye Necronomicon that you recommende. But I woud have you Observe what was tolde to us aboute takg Care whom to calle up, for you are Sensible what Mr. Mather writ in ye Magnalia of  -  - , and can judge how truely that Horrendous thing is reported. I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe; by the Which I meane, Any that can in Turne call up somewhat against you, whereby your Powerfullest Devices may not be of use. Ask of the Lesser, lest the Greater shall not wish to Answer, and shall commande more than you. I was frighted when I read of your knowg what Ben Zariatnatmik hadde in his ebony Boxe, for I was conscious who must have tolde you. And againe I ask that you shalle write me as Jedediah and not Simon. In this Community a Man may not live too long, and you knowe my Plan by which I came back as my Son. I am desirous you will Acquaint me with what ye Blacke Man learnt from Sylvanus Cocidius in ye Vault, under ye Roman Wall, and will be obligd for ye Lendg of ye MS. you speak of.\"      Another and unsigned letter from Philadelphia provoked equal thought, especially for the following passage:      \"I will observe what you say respecting the sending of Accounts only by yr Vessels, but can not always be certain when to expect them. In the Matter spoke of, I require onlie one more thing; but wish to be sure I apprehend you exactly. You inform me, that no Part must be missing if the finest Effects are to be had, but you can not but know how hard it is to be sure. It seems a great Hazard and Burthen to take away the whole Box, and in Town (i.e. St. Peters, St. Pauls, St. Marys, or Christ Church) it can scarce be done at all. But I know what Imperfections were in the one I raisd up October last, and how many live Specimens you were forcd to imploy before you hit upon the right Mode in the year 1766; so will be guided by you in all Matters. I am impatient for yr Brig, and inquire daily at Mr. Biddles Wharf.\"      A third suspicious letter was in an unknown tongue and even an unknown alphabet. In the Smith diary found by Charles Ward a single oft-repeated combination of characters is clumsily copied; and authorities at Brown University have pronounced the alphabet Amharic or Abyssinian, although they do not recognise the word. None of these epistles was ever delivered to Curwen, though the disappearance of Jedediah Orne from Salem as recorded shortly afterward shewed that the Providence men took certain quiet steps. The Pennsylvania Historical Society also has some curious letters received by Dr. Shippen regarding the presence of an unwholesome character in Philadelphia. But more decisive steps were in the air, and it is in the secret assemblages of sworn and tested sailors and faithful old privateersmen in the Brown warehouses by night that we must look for the main fruits of Weedens disclosures. Slowly and surely a plan of campaign was under development which would leave no trace of Joseph Curwens noxious mysteries.      Curwen, despite all precautions, apparently felt that something was in the wind; for he was now remarked to wear an unusually worried look. His coach was seen at all hours in the town and on the Pawtuxet Road, and he dropped little by little the air of forced geniality with which he had latterly sought to combat the towns prejudice. The nearest neighbours to his farm, the Fenners, one night remarked a great shaft of light shooting into the sky from some aperture in the roof of that cryptical stone building with the high, excessively narrow windows; an event which they quickly communicated to John Brown in Providence. Mr. Brown had become the executive leader of the select group bent on Curwens extirpation, and had informed the Fenners that some action was about to be taken. This he deemed needful because of the impossibility of their not witnessing the final raid; and he explained his course by saying that Curwen was known to be a spy of the customs officers at Newport, against whom the hand of every Providence shipper, merchant, and farmer was openly or clandestinely raised. Whether the ruse was wholly believed by neighbours who had seen so many queer things is not certain; but at any rate the Fenners were willing to connect any evil with a man of such queer ways. To them Mr. Brown had entrusted the duty of watching the Curwen farmhouse, and of regularly reporting every incident which took place there.5.      The probability that Curwen was on guard and attempting unusual things, as suggested by the odd shaft of light, precipitated at last the action so carefully devised by the band of serious citizens. According to the Smith diary a company of about 100 men met at 10 p.m. on Friday, April 12th, 1771, in the great room of Thurstons Tavern at the Sign of the Golden Lion on Weybosset Point across the Bridge. Of the guiding group of prominent men in addition to the leader John Brown there were present Dr. Bowen, with his case of surgical instruments, President Manning without the great periwig (the largest in the Colonies) for which he was noted, Governor Hopkins, wrapped in his dark cloak and accompanied by his seafaring brother Esek, whom he had initiated at the last moment with the permission of the rest, John Carter, Capt. Mathewson, and Capt. Whipple, who was to lead the actual raiding party. These chiefs conferred apart in a rear chamber, after which Capt. Whipple emerged to the great room and gave the gathered seamen their last oaths and instructions. Eleazar Smith was with the leaders as they sat in the rear apartment awaiting the arrival of Ezra Weeden, whose duty was to keep track of Curwen and report the departure of his coach for the farm.      About 10:30 a heavy rumble was heard on the Great Bridge, followed by the sound of a coach in the street outside; and at that hour there was no need of waiting for Weeden in order to know that the doomed man had set out for his last night of unhallowed wizardry. A moment later, as the receding coach clattered faintly over the Muddy Dock Bridge, Weeden appeared; and the raiders fell silently into military order in the street, shouldering the firelocks, fowling-pieces, or whaling harpoons which they had with them. Weeden and Smith were with the party, and of the deliberating citizens there were present for active service Capt. Whipple, the leader, Capt. Esek Hopkins, John Carter, President Manning, Capt. Mathewson, and Dr. Bowen; together with Moses Brown, who had come up at the eleventh hour though absent from the preliminary session in the tavern. All these freemen and their hundred sailors began the long march without delay, grim and a trifle apprehensive as they left the Muddy Dock behind and mounted the gentle rise of Broad Street toward the Pawtuxet Road. Just beyond Elder Snows church some of the men turned back to take a parting look at Providence lying outspread under the early spring stars. Steeples and gables rose dark and shapely, and salt breezes swept up gently from the cove north of the Bridge. Vega was climbing above the great hill across the water, whose crest of trees was broken by the roof-line of the unfinished College edifice. At the foot of that hill, and along the narrow mounting lanes of its side, the old town dreamed; Old Providence, for whose safety and sanity so monstrous and colossal a blasphemy was about to be wiped out.      An hour and a quarter later the raiders arrived, as previously agreed, at the Fenner farmhouse; where they heard a final report on their intended victim. He had reached his farm over half an hour before, and the strange light had soon afterward shot once into the sky, but there were no lights in any visible windows. This was always the case of late. Even as this news was given another great glare arose toward the south, and the party realised that they had indeed come close to the scene of awesome and unnatural wonders. Capt. Whipple now ordered his force to separate into three divisions; one of twenty men under Eleazar Smith to strike across to the shore and guard the landing-place against possible reinforcements for Curwen until summoned by a messenger for desperate service, a second of twenty men under Capt. Esek Hopkins to steal down into the river valley behind the Curwen farm and demolish with axes or gunpowder the oaken door in the high, steep bank, and the third to close in on the house and adjacent buildings themselves. Of this division one third was to be led by Capt. Mathewson to the cryptical stone edifice with high narrow windows, another third to follow Capt. Whipple himself to the main farmhouse, and the remaining third to preserve a circle around the whole group of buildings until summoned by a final emergency signal.      The river party would break down the hillside door at the sound of a single whistle-blast, then waiting and capturing anything which might issue from the regions within. At the sound of two whistle-blasts it would advance through the aperture to oppose the enemy or join the rest of the raiding contingent. The party at the stone building would accept these respective signals in an analogous manner; forcing an entrance at the first, and at the second descending whatever passage into the ground might be discovered, and joining the general or focal warfare expected to take place within the caverns. A third or emergency signal of three blasts would summon the immediate reserve from its general guard duty; its twenty men dividing equally and entering the unknown depths through both farmhouse and stone building. Capt. Whipples belief in the existence of catacombs was absolute, and he took no alternative into consideration when making his plans. He had with him a whistle of great power and shrillness, and did not fear any upsetting or misunderstanding of signals. The final reserve at the landing, of course, was nearly out of the whistles range; hence would require a special messenger if needed for help. Moses Brown and John Carter went with Capt. Hopkins to the river-bank, while President Manning was detailed with Capt. Mathewson to the stone building. Dr. Bowen, with Ezra Weeden, remained in Capt. Whipples party which was to storm the farmhouse itself. The attack was to begin as soon as a messenger from Capt. Hopkins had joined Capt. Whipple to notify him of the river partys readiness. The leader would then deliver the loud single blast, and the various advance parties would commence their simultaneous attack on three points. Shortly before 1 a.m. the three divisions left the Fenner farmhouse; one to guard the landing, another to seek the river valley and the hillside door, and the third to subdivide and attend to the actual buildings of the Curwen farm.      Eleazar Smith, who accompanied the shore-guarding party, records in his diary an uneventful march and a long wait on the bluff by the bay; broken once by what seemed to be the distant sound of the signal whistle and again by a peculiar muffled blend of roaring and crying and a powder blast which seemed to come from the same direction. Later on one man thought he caught some distant gunshots, and still later Smith himself felt the throb of titanic and thunderous words resounding in upper air. It was just before dawn that a single haggard messenger with wild eyes and a hideous unknown odour about his clothing appeared and told the detachment to disperse quietly to their homes and never again think or speak of the nights doings or of him who had been Joseph Curwen. Something about the bearing of the messenger carried a conviction which his mere words could never have conveyed; for though he was a seaman well known to many of them, there was something obscurely lost or gained in his soul which set him for evermore apart. It was the same later on when they met other old companions who had gone into that zone of horror. Most of them had lost or gained something imponderable and indescribable. They had seen or heard or felt something which was not for human creatures, and could not forget it. From them there was never any gossip, for to even the commonest of mortal instincts there are terrible boundaries. And from that single messenger the party at the shore caught a nameless awe which almost sealed their own lips. Very few are the rumours which ever came from any of them, and Eleazar Smiths diary is the only written record which has survived from that whole expedition which set forth from the Sign of the Golden Lion under the stars.      Charles Ward, however, discovered another vague sidelight in some Fenner correspondence which he found in New London, where he knew another branch of the family had lived. It seems that the Fenners, from whose house the doomed farm was distantly visible, had watched the departing columns of raiders; and had heard very clearly the angry barking of the Curwen dogs, followed by the first shrill blast which precipitated the attack. This blast had been followed by a repetition of the great shaft of light from the stone building, and in another moment, after a quick sounding of the second signal ordering a general invasion, there had come a subdued prattle of musketry followed by a horrible roaring cry which the correspondent Luke Fenner had represented in his epistle by the characters \"Waaaahrrrrr - Rwaaahrrr\". This cry, however, had possessed a quality which no mere writing could convey, and the correspondent mentions that his mother fainted completely at the sound. It was later repeated less loudly, and further but more muffled evidences of gunfire ensued; together with a loud explosion of powder from the direction of the river. About an hour afterward all the dogs began to bark frightfully, and there were vague ground rumblings so marked that the candlesticks tottered on the mantelpiece. A strong smell of sulphur was noted; and Luke Fenners father declared that he heard the third or emergency whistle signal, though the others failed to detect it. Muffled musketry sounded again, followed by a deep scream less piercing but even more horrible than those which had preceded it; a kind of throaty, nastily plastic cough or gurgle whose quality as a scream must have come more from its continuity and psychological import than from its actual acoustic value.      Then the flaming thing burst into sight at a point where the Curwen farm ought to lie, and the human cries of desperate and frightened men were heard. Muskets flashed and cracked, and the flaming thing fell to the ground. A second flaming thing appeared, and a shriek of human origin was plainly distinguished. Fenner wrote that he could even gather a few words belched in frenzy: \"Almighty, protect thy lamb!\" Then there were more shots, and the second flaming thing fell. After that came silence for about three-quarters of an hour; at the end of which time little Arthur Fenner, Lukes brother, exclaimed that he saw a red fog going up to the stars from the accursed farm in the distance. No one but the child can testify to this, but Luke admits the significant coincidence implied by the panic of almost convulsive fright which at the same moment arched the backs and stiffened the fur of the three cats then within the room.      Five minutes later a chill wind blew up, and the air became suffused with such an intolerable stench that only the strong freshness of the sea could have prevented its being noticed by the shore party or by any wakeful souls in Pawtuxet village. This stench was nothing which any of the Fenners had ever encountered before, and produced a kind of clutching, amorphous fear beyond that of the tomb or the charnel-house. Close upon it came the awful voice which no hapless hearer will ever be able to forget. It thundered out of the sky like a doom, and windows rattled as its echoes died away. It was deep and musical; powerful as a bass organ, but evil as the forbidden books of the Arabs. What it said no man can tell, for it spoke in an unknown tongue, but this is the writing Luke Fenner set down to portray the daemoniac intonations: \"DEESMEES-JESHET-BONE DOSEFE DUVEMA-ENITEMOSS\". Not till the year 1919 did any soul link this crude transcript with anything else in mortal knowledge, but Charles Ward paled as he recognised what Mirandola had denounced in shudders as the ultimate horror among black magics incantations.      An unmistakably human shout or deep chorused scream seemed to answer this malign wonder from the Curwen farm, after which the unknown stench grew complex with an added odour equally intolerable. A wailing distinctly different from the scream now burst out, and was protracted ululantly in rising and falling paroxysms. At times it became almost articulate, though no auditor could trace any definite words; and at one point it seemed to verge toward the confines of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Then a yell of utter, ultimate fright and stark madness wrenched from scores of human throats - a yell which came strong and clear despite the depth from which it must have burst; after which darkness and silence ruled all things. Spirals of acrid smoke ascended to blot out the stars, though no flames appeared and no buildings were observed to be gone or injured on the following day.      Toward dawn two frightened messengers with monstrous and unplaceable odours saturating their clothing knocked at the Fenner door and requested a keg of rum, for which they paid very well indeed. One of them told the family that the affair of Joseph Curwen was over, and that the events of the night were not to be mentioned again. Arrogant as the order seemed, the aspect of him who gave it took away all resentment and lent it a fearsome authority; so that only these furtive letters of Luke Fenner, which he urged his Connecticut relative to destroy, remain to tell what was seen and heard. The non-compliance of that relative, whereby the letters were saved after all, has alone kept the matter from a merciful oblivion. Charles Ward had one detail to add as a result of a long canvass of Pawtuxet residents for ancestral traditions. Old Charles Slocum of that village said that there was known to his grandfather a queer rumour concerning a charred, distorted body found in the fields a week after the death of Joseph Curwen was announced. What kept the talk alive was the notion that this body, so far as could be seen in its burnt and twisted condition, was neither thoroughly human nor wholly allied to any animal which Pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about.6.      Not one man who participated in that terrible raid could ever be induced to say a word concerning it, and every fragment of the vague data which survives comes from those outside the final fighting party. There is something frightful in the care with which these actual raiders destroyed each scrap which bore the least allusion to the matter. Eight sailors had been killed, but although their bodies were not produced their families were satisfied with the statement that a clash with customs officers had occurred. The same statement also covered the numerous cases of wounds, all of which were extensively bandaged and treated only by Dr. Jabez Bowen, who had accompanied the party. Hardest to explain was the nameless odour clinging to all the raiders, a thing which was discussed for weeks. Of the citizen leaders, Capt. Whipple and Moses Brown were most severely hurt, and letters of their wives testify the bewilderment which their reticence and close guarding of their bandages produced. Psychologically every participant was aged, sobered, and shaken. It is fortunate that they were all strong men of action and simple, orthodox religionists, for with more subtle introspectiveness and mental complexity they would have fared ill indeed. President Manning was the most disturbed; but even he outgrew the darkest shadow, and smothered memories in prayers. Every man of those leaders had a stirring part to play in later years, and it is perhaps fortunate that this is so. Little more than a twelvemonth afterward Capt. Whipple led the mob who burnt the revenue ship Gaspee, and in this bold act we may trace one step in the blotting out of unwholesome images.      There was delivered to the widow of Joseph Curwen a sealed leaden coffin of curious design, obviously found ready on the spot when needed, in which she was told her husbands body lay. He had, it was explained, been killed in a customs battle about which it was not politic to give details. More than this no tongue ever uttered of Joseph Curwens end, and Charles Ward had only a single hint wherewith to construct a theory. This hint was the merest thread - a shaky underscoring of a passage in Jedediah Ornes confiscated letter to Curwen, as partly copied in Ezra Weedens handwriting. The copy was found in the possession of Smiths descendants; and we are left to decide whether Weeden gave it to his companion after the end, as a mute clue to the abnormality which had occurred, or whether, as is more probable, Smith had it before, and added the underscoring himself from what he had managed to extract from his friend by shrewd guessing and adroit cross-questioning. The underlined passage is merely this:      \"I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe; by the Which I meane, Any that can in Turne call up somewhat against you, whereby your Powerfullest Devices may not be of use. Ask of the Lesser, lest the Greater shall not wish to Answer, and shall commande more than you.\"In the light of this passage, and reflecting on what last unmentionable allies a beaten man might try to summon in his direst extremity, Charles Ward may well have wondered whether any citizen of Providence killed Joseph Curwen.      The deliberate effacement of every memory of the dead man from Providence life and annals was vastly aided by the influence of the raiding leaders. They had not at first meant to be so thorough, and had allowed the widow and her father and child to remain in ignorance of the true conditions; but Capt. Tillinghast was an astute man, and soon uncovered enough rumours to whet his horror and cause him to demand that his daughter and granddaughter change their name, burn the library and all remaining papers, and chisel the inscription from the slate slab above Joseph Curwens grave. He knew Capt. Whipple well, and probably extracted more hints from that bluff mariner than anyone else ever gained respecting the end of the accused sorcerer.      From that time on the obliteration of Curwens memory became increasingly rigid, extending at last by common consent even to the town records and files of the Gazette. It can be compared in spirit only to the hush that lay on Oscar Wildes name for a decade after his disgrace, and in extent only to the fate of that sinful King of Runazar in Lord Dunsanys tale, whom the Gods decided must not only cease to be, but must cease ever to have been.      Mrs. Tillinghast, as the widow became known after 1772, sold the house in Olney Court and resided with her father in Powers Lane till her death in 1817. The farm at Pawtuxet, shunned by every living soul, remained to moulder through the years; and seemed to decay with unaccountable rapidity. By 1780 only the stone and brickwork were standing, and by 1800 even these had fallen to shapeless heaps. None ventured to pierce the tangled shrubbery on the river-bank behind which the hillside door may have lain, nor did any try to frame a definite image of the scenes amidst which Joseph Curwen departed from the horrors he had wrought.      Only robust old Capt. Whipple was heard by alert listeners to mutter once in a while to himself, \"Pox on that  -  -  - , but he had no business to laugh while he screamed. Twas as though the damnd  -  -  -  had someat up his sleeve. For half a crown Id burn his  -  -  -  house.\"", "X.In the end the three men from Arkham—old, white-bearded Dr. Armitage, stocky, iron-grey Professor Rice, and lean, youngish Dr. Morgan—ascended the mountain alone. After much patient instruction regarding its focussing and use, they left the telescope with the frightened group that remained in the road; and as they climbed they were watched closely by those among whom the glass was passed around. It was hard going, and Armitage had to be helped more than once. High above the toiling group the great swath trembled as its hellish maker re-passed with snail-like deliberateness. Then it was obvious that the pursuers were gaining.      Curtis Whateley—of the undecayed branch—was holding the telescope when the Arkham party detoured radically from the swath. He told the crowd that the men were evidently trying to get to a subordinate peak which overlooked the swath at a point considerably ahead of where the shrubbery was now bending. This, indeed, proved to be true; and the party were seen to gain the minor elevation only a short time after the invisible blasphemy had passed it.      Then Wesley Corey, who had taken the glass, cried out that Armitage was adjusting the sprayer which Rice held, and that something must be about to happen. The crowd stirred uneasily, recalling that this sprayer was expected to give the unseen horror a moment of visibility. Two or three men shut their eyes, but Curtis Whateley snatched back the telescope and strained his vision to the utmost. He saw that Rice, from the party’s point of vantage above and behind the entity, had an excellent chance of spreading the potent powder with marvellous effect.      Those without the telescope saw only an instant’s flash of grey cloud—a cloud about the size of a moderately large building—near the top of the mountain. Curtis, who had held the instrument, dropped it with a piercing shriek into the ankle-deep mud of the road. He reeled, and would have crumpled to the ground had not two or three others seized and steadied him. All he could do was moan half-inaudibly,      “Oh, oh, great Gawd . . . that . . . that . . .”      There was a pandemonium of questioning, and only Henry Wheeler thought to rescue the fallen telescope and wipe it clean of mud. Curtis was past all coherence, and even isolated replies were almost too much for him.      “Bigger’n a barn . . . all made o’ squirmin’ ropes . . . hull thing sort o’ shaped like a hen’s egg bigger’n anything, with dozens o’ legs like hogsheads that haff shut up when they step . . . nothin’ solid abaout it—all like jelly, an’ made o’ sep’rit wrigglin’ ropes pushed clost together . . . great bulgin’ eyes all over it . . . ten or twenty maouths or trunks a-stickin’ aout all along the sides, big as stovepipes, an’ all a-tossin’ an’ openin’ an’ shuttin’ . . . all grey, with kinder blue or purple rings . . . an’ Gawd in heaven—that haff face on top! . . .”      This final memory, whatever it was, proved too much for poor Curtis; and he collapsed completely before he could say more. Fred Farr and Will Hutchins carried him to the roadside and laid him on the damp grass. Henry Wheeler, trembling, turned the rescued telescope on the mountain to see what he might. Through the lenses were discernible three tiny figures, apparently running toward the summit as fast as the steep incline allowed. Only these—nothing more. Then everyone noticed a strangely unseasonable noise in the deep valley behind, and even in the underbrush of Sentinel Hill itself. It was the piping of unnumbered whippoorwills, and in their shrill chorus there seemed to lurk a note of tense and evil expectancy.      Earl Sawyer now took the telescope and reported the three figures as standing on the topmost ridge, virtually level with the altar-stone but at a considerable distance from it. One figure, he said, seemed to be raising its hands above its head at rhythmic intervals; and as Sawyer mentioned the circumstance the crowd seemed to hear a faint, half-musical sound from the distance, as if a loud chant were accompanying the gestures. The weird silhouette on that remote peak must have been a spectacle of infinite grotesqueness and impressiveness, but no observer was in a mood for aesthetic appreciation. “I guess he’s sayin’ the spell,” whispered Wheeler as he snatched back the telescope. The whippoorwills were piping wildly, and in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of the visible ritual.      Suddenly the sunshine seemed to lessen without the intervention of any discernible cloud. It was a very peculiar phenomenon, and was plainly marked by all. A rumbling sound seemed brewing beneath the hills, mixed strangely with a concordant rumbling which clearly came from the sky. Lightning flashed aloft, and the wondering crowd looked in vain for the portents of storm. The chanting of the men from Arkham now became unmistakable, and Wheeler saw through the glass that they were all raising their arms in the rhythmic incantation. From some farmhouse far away came the frantic barking of dogs.      The change in the quality of the daylight increased, and the crowd gazed about the horizon in wonder. A purplish darkness, born of nothing more than a spectral deepening of the sky’s blue, pressed down upon the rumbling hills. Then the lightning flashed again, somewhat brighter than before, and the crowd fancied that it had shewed a certain mistiness around the altar-stone on the distant height. No one, however, had been using the telescope at that instant. The whippoorwills continued their irregular pulsation, and the men of Dunwich braced themselves tensely against some imponderable menace with which the atmosphere seemed surcharged.      Without warning came those deep, cracked, raucous vocal sounds which will never leave the memory of the stricken group who heard them. Not from any human throat were they born, for the organs of man can yield no such acoustic perversions. Rather would one have said they came from the pit itself, had not their source been so unmistakably the altar-stone on the peak. It is almost erroneous to call them sounds at all, since so much of their ghastly, infra-bass timbre spoke to dim seats of consciousness and terror far subtler than the ear; yet one must do so, since their form was indisputably though vaguely that of half-articulate words. They were loud—loud as the rumblings and the thunder above which they echoed—yet did they come from no visible being. And because imagination might suggest a conjectural source in the world of non-visible beings, the huddled crowd at the mountain’s base huddled still closer, and winced as if in expectation of a blow.      “Ygnaiih . . . ygnaiih . . . thflthkh’ngha . . . Yog-Sothoth . . .” rang the hideous croaking out of space. “Y’bthnk . . . h’ehye—n’grkdl’lh. . . .”      The speaking impulse seemed to falter here, as if some frightful psychic struggle were going on. Henry Wheeler strained his eye at the telescope, but saw only the three grotesquely silhouetted human figures on the peak, all moving their arms furiously in strange gestures as their incantation drew near its culmination. From what black wells of Acherontic fear or feeling, from what unplumbed gulfs of extra-cosmic consciousness or obscure, long-latent heredity, were those half-articulate thunder-croakings drawn? Presently they began to gather renewed force and coherence as they grew in stark, utter, ultimate frenzy.      “Eh-ya-ya-ya-yahaah—e’yayayayaaaa . . . ngh’aaaaa . . . ngh’aaaa . . . h’yuh . . . h’yuh . . . HELP! HELP! . . . ff—ff—ff—FATHER! FATHER! YOG-SOTHOTH! . . .”      But that was all. The pallid group in the road, still reeling at the indisputably English syllables that had poured thickly and thunderously down from the frantic vacancy beside that shocking altar-stone, were never to hear such syllables again. Instead, they jumped violently at the terrific report which seemed to rend the hills; the deafening, cataclysmic peal whose source, be it inner earth or sky, no hearer was ever able to place. A single lightning-bolt shot from the purple zenith to the altar-stone, and a great tidal wave of viewless force and indescribable stench swept down from the hill to all the countryside. Trees, grass, and underbrush were whipped into a fury; and the frightened crowd at the mountain’s base, weakened by the lethal foetor that seemed about to asphyxiate them, were almost hurled off their feet. Dogs howled from the distance, green grass and foliage wilted to a curious, sickly yellow-grey, and over field and forest were scattered the bodies of dead whippoorwills.      The stench left quickly, but the vegetation never came right again. To this day there is something queer and unholy about the growths on and around that fearsome hill. Curtis Whateley was only just regaining consciousness when the Arkham men came slowly down the mountain in the beams of a sunlight once more brilliant and untainted. They were grave and quiet, and seemed shaken by memories and reflections even more terrible than those which had reduced the group of natives to a state of cowed quivering. In reply to a jumble of questions they only shook their heads and reaffirmed one vital fact.      “The thing has gone forever,” Armitage said. “It has been split up into what it was originally made of, and can never exist again. It was an impossibility in a normal world. Only the least fraction was really matter in any sense we know. It was like its father—and most of it has gone back to him in some vague realm or dimension outside our material universe; some vague abyss out of which only the most accursed rites of human blasphemy could ever have called him for a moment on the hills.”      There was a brief silence, and in that pause the scattered senses of poor Curtis Whateley began to knit back into a sort of continuity; so that he put his hands to his head with a moan. Memory seemed to pick itself up where it had left off, and the horror of the sight that had prostrated him burst in upon him again.      “Oh, oh, my Gawd, that haff face—that haff face on top of it . . . that face with the red eyes an’ crinkly albino hair, an’ no chin, like the Whateleys . . . It was a octopus, centipede, spider kind o’ thing, but they was a haff-shaped man’s face on top of it, an’ it looked like Wizard Whateley’s, only it was yards an’ yards acrost. . . .”      He paused exhausted, as the whole group of natives stared in a bewilderment not quite crystallised into fresh terror. Only old Zebulon Whateley, who wanderingly remembered ancient things but who had been silent heretofore, spoke aloud.      “Fifteen year’ gone,” he rambled, “I heerd Ol’ Whateley say as haow some day we’d hear a child o’ Lavinny’s a-callin’ its father’s name on the top o’ Sentinel Hill. . . .”      But Joe Osborn interrupted him to question the Arkham men anew.      “What was it anyhaow, an’ haowever did young Wizard Whateley call it aout o’ the air it come from?”      Armitage chose his words very carefully.      “It was—well, it was mostly a kind of force that doesn’t belong in our part of space; a kind of force that acts and grows and shapes itself by other laws than those of our sort of Nature. We have no business calling in such things from outside, and only very wicked people and very wicked cults ever try to. There was some of it in Wilbur Whateley himself—enough to make a devil and a precocious monster of him, and to make his passing out a pretty terrible sight. I’m going to burn his accursed diary, and if you men are wise you’ll dynamite that altar-stone up there, and pull down all the rings of standing stones on the other hills. Things like that brought down the beings those Whateleys were so fond of—the beings they were going to let in tangibly to wipe out the human race and drag the earth off to some nameless place for some nameless purpose.      “But as to this thing we’ve just sent back—the Whateleys raised it for a terrible part in the doings that were to come. It grew fast and big from the same reason that Wilbur grew fast and big—but it beat him because it had a greater share of the outsideness in it. You needn’t ask how Wilbur called it out of the air. He didn’t call it out. It was his twin brother, but it looked more like the father than he did.”"]}
{"id": "EN093", "pair": ["III. A Search and an Evocation1.Charles Ward, as we have seen, first learned in 1918 of his descent from Joseph Curwen. That he at once took an intense interest in everything pertaining to the bygone mystery is not to be wondered at; for every vague rumour that he had heard of Curwen now became something vital to himself, in whom flowed Curwens blood. No spirited and imaginative genealogist could have done otherwise than begin forthwith an avid and systematic collection of Curwen data.      In his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at secrecy; so that even Dr. Lyman hesitates to date the youths madness from any period before the close of 1919. He talked freely with his family - though his mother was not particularly pleased to own an ancestor like Curwen - and with the officials of the various museums and libraries he visited. In applying to private families for records thought to be in their possession he made no concealment of his object, and shared the somewhat amused scepticism with which the accounts of the old diarists and letter-writers were regarded. He often expressed a keen wonder as to what really had taken place a century and a half before at that Pawtuxet farmhouse whose site he vainly tried to find, and what Joseph Curwen really had been.      When he came across the Smith diary and archives and encountered the letter from Jedediah Orne he decided to visit Salem and look up Curwens early activities and connexions there, which he did during the Easter vacation of 1919. At the Essex Institute, which was well known to him from former sojourns in the glamorous old town of crumbling Puritan gables and clustered gambrel roofs, he was very kindly received, and unearthed there a considerable amount of Curwen data. He found that his ancestor was born in Salem-Village, now Danvers, seven miles from town, on the eighteenth of February (O.S.) 1662-3; and that he had run away to sea at the age of fifteen, not appearing again for nine years, when he returned with the speech, dress, and manners of a native Englishman and settled in Salem proper. At that time he had little to do with his family, but spent most of his hours with the curious books he had brought from Europe, and the strange chemicals which came for him on ships from England, France, and Holland. Certain trips of his into the country were the objects of much local inquisitiveness, and were whisperingly associated with vague rumours of fires on the hills at night.      Curwens only close friends had been one Edward Hutchinson of Salem-Village and one Simon Orne of Salem. With these men he was often seen in conference about the Common, and visits among them were by no means infrequent. Hutchinson had a house well out toward the woods, and it was not altogether liked by sensitive people because of the sounds heard there at night. He was said to entertain strange visitors, and the lights seen from his windows were not always of the same colour. The knowledge he displayed concerning long-dead persons and long-forgotten events was considered distinctly unwholesome, and he disappeared about the time the witchcraft panic began, never to be heard from again. At that time Joseph Curwen also departed, but his settlement in Providence was soon learned of. Simon Orne lived in Salem until 1720, when his failure to grow visibly old began to excite attention. He thereafter disappeared, though thirty years later his precise counterpart and self-styled son turned up to claim his property. The claim was allowed on the strength of documents in Simon Ornes known hand, and Jedediah Orne continued to dwell in Salem till 1771, when certain letters from Providence citizens to the Rev. Thomas Barnard and others brought about his quiet removal to parts unknown.      Certain documents by and about all of these strange characters were available at the Essex Institute, the Court House, and the Registry of Deeds, and included both harmless commonplaces such as land titles and bills of sale, and furtive fragments of a more provocative nature. There were four or five unmistakable allusions to them on the witchcraft trial records; as when one Hepzibah Lawson swore on July 10, 1692, at the Court of Oyer and Terminer under Judge Hathorne, that fortie Witches and the Blacke Man were wont to meete in the Woodes behind Mr. Hutchinsons house, and one Amity How declared at a session of August 8th before Judge Gedney that Mr. G. B. (Rev. George Burroughs) on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B. Then there was a catalogue of Hutchinsons uncanny library as found after his disappearance, and an unfinished manuscript in his handwriting, couched in a cipher none could read. Ward had a photostatic copy of this manuscript made, and began to work casually on the cipher as soon as it was delivered to him. After the following August his labours on the cipher became intense and feverish, and there is reason to believe from his speech and conduct that he hit upon the key before October or November. He never stated, though, whether or not he had succeeded.      But of the greatest immediate interest was the Orne material. It took Ward only a short time to prove from identity of penmanship a thing he had already considered established from the text of the letter to Curwen; namely, that Simon Orne and his supposed son were one and the same person. As Orne had said to his correspondent, it was hardly safe to live too long in Salem, hence he resorted to a thirty-year sojourn abroad, and did not return to claim his lands except as a representative of a new generation. Orne had apparently been careful to destroy most of his correspondence, but the citizens who took action in 1771 found and preserved a few letters and papers which excited their wonder. There were cryptic formulae and diagrams in his and other hands which Ward now either copied with care or had photographed, and one extremely mysterious letter in a chirography that the searcher recognised from items in the Registry of Deeds as positively Joseph Curwens.      This Curwen letter, though undated as to the year, was evidently not the one in answer to which Orne had written the confiscated missive; and from internal evidence Ward placed it not much later than 1750. It may not be amiss to give the text in full, as a sample of the style of one whose history was so dark and terrible. The recipient is addressed as \"Simon\", but a line (whether drawn by Curwen or Orne Ward could not tell) is run through the word.Prouidence, I.

This letter, oddly enough, was what first gave Ward the exact location of Curwens Providence home; for none of the records encountered up to that time had been at all specific. The discovery was doubly striking because it indicated as the newer Curwen house built in 1761 on the site of the old, a dilapidated building still standing in Olney Court and well known to Ward in his antiquarian rambles over Stampers Hill. The place was indeed only a few squares from his own home on the great hills higher ground, and was now the abode of a negro family much esteemed for occasional washing, housecleaning, and furnace-tending services. To find, in distant Salem, such sudden proof of the significance of this familiar rookery in his own family history, was a highly impressive thing to Ward; and he resolved to explore the place immediately upon his return. The more mystical phases of the letter, which he took to be some extravagant kind of symbolism, frankly baffled him; though he noted with a thrill of curiosity that the Biblical passage referred to - Job 14, 14 - was the familiar verse, \"If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.\"2.      Young Ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement, and spent the following Saturday in a long and exhaustive study of the house in Olney Court. The place, now crumbling with age, had never been a mansion; but was a modest two-and-a-half story wooden town house of the familiar Providence colonial type, with plain peaked roof, large central chimney, and artistically carved doorway with rayed fanlight, triangular pediment, and trim Doric pilasters. It had suffered but little alteration externally, and Ward felt he was gazing on something very close to the sinister matters of his quest.      The present negro inhabitants were known to him, and he was very courteously shewn about the interior by old Asa and his stout wife Hannah. Here there was more change than the outside indicated, and Ward saw with regret that fully half of the fine scroll-and-urn overmantels and shell-carved cupboard linings were gone, whilst much of the fine wainscotting and bolection moulding was marked, hacked, and gouged, or covered up altogether with cheap wall-paper. In general, the survey did not yield as much as Ward had somehow expected; but it was at least exciting to stand within the ancestral walls which had housed such a man of horror as Joseph Curwen. He saw with a thrill that a monogram had been very carefully effaced from the ancient brass knocker.      From then until after the close of school Ward spent his time on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local Curwen data. The former still proved unyielding; but of the latter he obtained so much, and so many clues to similar data elsewhere, that he was ready by July to make a trip to New London and New York to consult old letters whose presence in those places was indicated. This trip was very fruitful, for it brought him the Fenner letters with their terrible description of the Pawtuxet farmhouse raid, and the Nightingale-Talbot letters in which he learned of the portrait painted on a panel of the Curwen library. This matter of the portrait interested him particularly, since he would have given much to know just what Joseph Curwen looked like; and he decided to make a second search of the house in Olney Court to see if there might not be some trace of the ancient features beneath peeling coats of later paint or layers of mouldy wall-paper.      Early in August that search took place, and Ward went carefully over the walls of every room sizeable enough to have been by any possibility the library of the evil builder. He paid especial attention to the large panels of such overmantels as still remained; and was keenly excited after about an hour, when on a broad area above the fireplace in a spacious ground-floor room he became certain that the surface brought out by the peeling of several coats of paint was sensibly darker than any ordinary interior paint or the wood beneath it was likely to have been. A few more careful tests with a thin knife, and he knew that he had come upon an oil portrait of great extent. With truly scholarly restraint the youth did not risk the damage which an immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture with the knife might have done, but just retired from the scene of his discovery to enlist expert help. In three days he returned with an artist of long experience, Mr. Walter C. Dwight, whose studio is near the foot of College Hill; and that accomplished restorer of paintings set to work at once with proper methods and chemical substances. Old Asa and his wife were duly excited over their strange visitors, and were properly reimbursed for this invasion of their domestic hearth.      As day by day the work of restoration progressed, Charles Ward looked on with growing interest at the lines and shades gradually unveiled after their long oblivion. Dwight had begun at the bottom; hence since the picture was a three-quarter-length one, the face did not come out for some time. It was meanwhile seen that the subject was a spare, well-shaped man with dark-blue coat, embroidered waistcoat, black satin small-clothes, and white silk stockings, seated in a carved chair against the background of a window with wharves and ships beyond. When the head came out it was observed to bear a neat Albemarle wig, and to possess a thin, calm, undistinguished face which seemed somehow familiar to both Ward and the artist. Only at the very last, though, did the restorer and his client begin to gasp with astonishment at the details of that lean, pallid visage, and to recognise with a touch of awe the dramatic trick which heredity had played. For it took the final bath of oil and the final stroke of the delicate scraper to bring out fully the expression which centuries had hidden; and to confront the bewildered Charles Dexter Ward, dweller in the past, with his own living features in the countenance of his horrible great-great-great-grandfather.      Ward brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered, and his father at once determined to purchase the picture despite its execution on stationary panelling. The resemblance to the boy, despite an appearance of rather greater age, was marvellous; and it could be seen that through some trick of atavism the physical contours of Joseph Curwen had found precise duplication after a century and a half. Mrs. Wards resemblance to her ancestor was not at all marked, though she could recall relatives who had some of the facial characteristics shared by her son and by the bygone Curwen. She did not relish the discovery, and told her husband that he had better burn the picture instead of bringing it home. There was, she averred, something unwholesome about it; not only intrinsically, but in its very resemblance to Charles. Mr. Ward, however, was a practical man of power and affairs - a cotton manufacturer with extensive mills at Riverpoint in the Pawtuxet Valley - and not one to listen to feminine scruples. The picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to his son, and he believed the boy deserved it as a present. In this opinion, it is needless to say, Charles most heartily concurred; and a few days later Mr. Ward located the owner of the house - a small rodent-featured person with a guttural accent - and obtained the whole mantel and overmantel bearing the picture at a curtly fixed priced which cut short the impending torrent of unctuous haggling.      It now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the Ward home, where provisions were made for its thorough restoration and installation with an electric mock-fireplace in Charless third-floor study or library. To Charles was left the task of superintending this removal, and on the twenty-eighth of August he accompanied two expert workmen from the Crooker decorating firm to the house in Olney Court, where the mantel and portrait-bearing overmantel were detached with great care and precision for transportation in the companys motor truck. There was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the chimneys course, and in this young Ward observed a cubical recess about a foot square, which must have lain directly behind the head of the portrait. Curious as to what such a space might mean or contain, the youth approached and looked within; finding beneath the deep coatings of dust and soot some loose yellowed papers, a crude, thick copybook, and a few mouldering textile shreds which may have formed the ribbon binding the rest together. Blowing away the bulk of the dirt and cinders, he took up the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover. It was in a hand which he had learned to recognise at the Essex Institute, and proclaimed the volume as the \"Journall and Notes of Jos: Curwen, Gent., of Providence-Plantations, Late of Salem.\"      Excited beyond measure by his discovery, Ward shewed the book to the two curious workmen beside him. Their testimony is absolute as to the nature and genuineness of the finding, and Dr. Willett relies on them to help establish his theory that the youth was not mad when he began his major eccentricities. All the other papers were likewise in Curwens handwriting, and one of them seemed especially portentous because of its inscription: \"To Him Who Shal Come After, & How He May Gett Beyonde Time & ye Spheres.\" Another was in a cipher; the same, Ward hoped, as the Hutchinson cipher which had hitherto baffled him. A third, and here the searcher rejoiced, seemed to be a key to the cipher; whilst the fourth and fifth were addressed respectively to \"Edw: Hutchinson, Armiger\" and \"Jedediah Orne, Esq.\", or Their Heir or Heirs, or Those Representg Them. The sixth and last was inscribed: \"Joseph Curwen his Life and Travells Betn ye yeares 1678 and 1687: Of Whither He Voyagd, Where He Stayd, Whom He Sawe, and What He Learnt.\"3.      We have now reached the point from which the more academic school of alienists date Charles Wards madness. Upon his discovery the youth had looked immediately at a few of the inner pages of the book and manuscripts, and had evidently seen something which impressed him tremendously. Indeed, in shewing the titles to the workmen he appeared to guard the text itself with peculiar care, and to labour under a perturbation for which even the antiquarian and genealogical significance of the find could hardly account. Upon returning home he broke the news with an almost embarrassed air, as if he wished to convey an idea of its supreme importance without having to exhibit the evidence itself. He did not even shew the titles to his parents, but simply told them that he had found some documents in Joseph Curwens handwriting, \"mostly in cipher\", which would have to be studied very carefully before yielding up their true meaning. It is unlikely that he would have shewn what he did to the workmen, had it not been for their unconcealed curiosity. As it was he doubtless wished to avoid any display of peculiar reticence which would increase their discussion of the matter.      That night Charles Ward sat up in his room reading the new-found book and papers, and when day came he did not desist. His meals, on his urgent request when his mother called to see what was amiss, were sent up to him; and in the afternoon he appeared only briefly when the men came to install the Curwen picture and mantelpiece in his study. The next night he slept in snatches in his clothes, meanwhile wrestling feverishly with the unravelling of the cipher manuscript. In the morning his mother saw that he was at work on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher, which he had frequently shewn her before; but in response to her query he said that the Curwen key could not be applied to it. That afternoon he abandoned his work and watched the men fascinatedly as they finished their installation of the picture with its woodwork above a cleverly realistic electric log, setting the mock-fireplace and overmantel a little out from the north wall as if a chimney existed, and boxing in the sides with panelling to match the rooms. The front panel holding the picture was sawn and hinged to allow cupboard space behind it. After the workmen went he moved his work into the study and sat down before it with his eyes half on the cipher and half on the portrait which stared back at him like a year-adding and century-recalling mirror.      His parents, subsequently recalling his conduct at this period, give interesting details anent the policy of concealment which he practiced. Before servants he seldom hid any paper which he might be studying, since he rightly assumed that Curwens intricate and archaic chirography would be too much for them. With his parents, however, he was more circumspect; and unless the manuscript in question were a cipher, or a mere mass of cryptic symbols and unknown ideographs (as that entitled \"To Him Who Shal Come After etc.\" seemed to be), he would cover it with some convenient paper until his caller had departed. At night he kept the papers under lock and key in an antique cabinet of his, where he also placed them whenever he left the room. He soon resumed fairly regular hours and habits, except that his long walks and other outside interests seemed to cease. The opening of school, where he now began his senior year, seemed a great bore to him; and he frequently asserted his determination never to bother with college. He had, he said, important special investigations to make, which would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and the humanities than any university which the world could boast.      Naturally, only one who had always been more or less studious, eccentric, and solitary could have pursued this course for many days without attracting notice. Ward, however, was constitutionally a scholar and a hermit; hence his parents were less surprised than regretful at the close confinement and secrecy he adopted. At the same time, both his father and mother thought it odd that he would shew them no scrap of his treasure-trove, nor give any connected account of such data as he had deciphered. This reticence he explained away as due to a wish to wait until he might announce some connected revelation, but as the weeks passed without further disclosures there began to grow up between the youth and his family a kind of constraint; intensified in his mothers case by her manifest disapproval of all Curwen delvings.      During October Ward began visiting the libraries again, but no longer for the antiquarian matter of his former days. Witchcraft and magic, occultism and daemonology, were what he sought now; and when Providence sources proved unfruitful he would take the train for Boston and tap the wealth of the great library in Copley Square, the Widener Library at Harvard, or the Zion Research Library in Brookline, where certain rare works on Biblical subjects are available. He bought extensively, and fitted up a whole additional set of shelves in his study for newly acquired works on uncanny subjects; while during the Christmas holidays he made a round of out-of-town trips including one to Salem to consult certain records at the Essex Institute.      About the middle of January, 1920, there entered Wards bearing an element of triumph which he did not explain, and he was no more found at work upon the Hutchinson cipher. Instead, he inaugurated a dual policy of chemical research and record-scanning; fitting up for the one a laboratory in the unused attic of the house, and for the latter haunting all the sources of vital statistics in Providence. Local dealers in drugs and scientific supplies, later questioned, gave astonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and instruments he purchased; but clerks at the State House, the City Hall, and the various libraries agree as to the definite object of his second interest. He was searching intensely and feverishly for the grave of Joseph Curwen, from whose slate slab an older generation had so wisely blotted the name.      Little by little there grew upon the Ward family the conviction that something was wrong. Charles had had freaks and changes of minor interests before, but this growing secrecy and absorption in strange pursuits was unlike even him. His school work was the merest pretence; and although he failed in no test, it could be seen that the old application had all vanished. He had other concernments now; and when not in his new laboratory with a score of obsolete alchemical books, could be found either poring over old burial records down town or glued to his volumes of occult lore in his study, where the startlingly - one almost fancied increasingly - similar features of Joseph Curwen stared blandly at him from the great overmantel on the north wall.      Late in March Ward added to his archive-searching a ghoulish series of rambles about the various ancient cemeteries of the city. The cause appeared later, when it was learned from City Hall clerks that he had probably found an important clue. His quest had suddenly shifted from the grave of Joseph Curwen to that of one Naphthali Field; and this shift was explained when, upon going over the files that he had been over, the investigators actually found a fragmentary record of Curwens burial which had escaped the general obliteration, and which stated that the curious leaden coffin had been interred \"10 ft. S. and 5 ft. W. of Naphthali Fields grave in ye - \". The lack of a specified burying-ground in the surviving entry greatly complicated the search, and Naphthali Fields grave seemed as elusive as that of Curwen; but here no systematic effacement had existed, and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on the stone itself even if its record had perished. Hence the rambles - from which St. Johns (the former Kings) Churchyard and the ancient Congregational burying-ground in the midst of Swan Point Cemetery were excluded, since other statistics had shewn that the only Naphthali Field (obiit 1729) whose grave could have been meant had been a Baptist.4.      It was toward May when Dr. Willett, at the request of the senior Ward, and fortified with all the Curwen data which the family had gleaned from Charles in his non-secretive days, talked with the young man. The interview was of little value or conclusiveness, for Willett felt at every moment that Charles was thoroughly master of himself and in touch with matters of real importance; but it at least forced the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanour. Of a pallid, impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment, Ward seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits, though not to reveal their object. He stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early scientific knowledge, for the most part in cipher, of an apparent scope comparable only to the discoveries of Friar Bacon and perhaps surpassing even those. They were, however, meaningless except when correlated with a body of learning now wholly obsolete; so that their immediate presentation to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all impressiveness and dramatic significance. To take their vivid place in the history of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of which they evolved, and to this task of correlation Ward was now devoting himself. He was seeking to acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of the Curwen data must possess, and hoped in time to make a full announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to the world of thought. Not even Einstein, he declared, could more profoundly revolutionise the current conception of things.      As to his graveyard search, whose object he freely admitted, but the details of whose progress he did not relate, he said he had reason to think that Joseph Curwens mutilated headstone bore certain mystic symbols - carved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by those who had effaced the name - which were absolutely essential to the final solution of his cryptic system. Curwen, he believed, had wished to guard his secret with care; and had consequently distributed the data in an exceedingly curious fashion. When Dr. Willett asked to see the mystic documents, Ward displayed much reluctance and tried to put him off with such things as photostatic copies of the Hutchinson cipher and Orne formulae and diagrams; but finally shewed him the exteriors of some of the real Curwen finds - the \"Journall and Notes\", the cipher (title in cipher also), and the formula-filled message \"To Him Who Shal Come After\" - and let him glance inside such as were in obscure characters.      He also opened the diary at a page carefully selected for its innocuousness and gave Willett a glimpse of Curwens connected handwriting in English. The doctor noted very closely the crabbed and complicated letters, and the general aura of the seventeenth century which clung round both penmanship and style despite the writers survival into the eighteenth century, and became quickly certain that the document was genuine. The text itself was relatively trivial, and Willett recalled only a fragment:\"Wedn. 16 Octr. 1754.

Simon hath not Writ these V. Weekes, but I expecte soon hearg from him.\"      When upon reaching this point Dr. Willett turned the leaf he was quickly checked by Ward, who almost snatched the book from his grasp. All that the doctor had a chance to see on the newly opened page was a brief pair of sentences; but these, strangely enough, lingered tenaciously in his memory. They ran: \"Ye Verse from Liber-Damnatus beg spoke V Roodmasses and IV Hallows-Eves, I am Hopeful ye Thing is breedg Outside ye Spheres. It will drawe One who is to Come, if I can make sure he shal bee, and he shall think on Past thinges and look back thro all ye yeares, against ye which I must have ready ye Saltes or That to make em with.\"      Willett saw no more, but somehow this small glimpse gave a new and vague terror to the painted features of Joseph Curwen which stared blandly down from the overmantel. Ever after that he entertained the odd fancy - which his medical skill of course assured him was only a fancy - that the eyes of the portrait had a sort of wish, if not an actual tendency, to follow young Charles Ward as he moved about the room. He stopped before leaving to study the picture closely, marvelling at its resemblance to Charles and memorising every minute detail of the cryptical, colourless face, even down to a slight scar or pit in the smooth brow above the right eye. Cosmo Alexander, he decided, was a painter worthy of the Scotland that produced Raeburn, and a teacher worthy of his illustrious pupil Gilbert Stuart.      Assured by the doctor that Charless mental health was in no danger, but that on the other hand he was engaged in researches which might prove of real importance, the Wards were more lenient than they might otherwise have been when during the following June the youth made positive his refusal to attend college. He had, he declared, studies of much more vital importance to pursue; and intimated a wish to go abroad the following year in order to avail himself of certain sources of data not existing in America. The senior Ward, while denying this latter wish as absurd for a boy of only eighteen, acquiesced regarding the university; so that after a none too brilliant graduation from the Moses Brown School there ensued for Charles a three-year period of intensive occult study and graveyard searching. He became recognised as an eccentric, and dropped even more completely from the sight of his familys friends than he had been before; keeping close to his work and only occasionally making trips to other cities to consult obscure records. Once he went south to talk with a strange old mulatto who dwelt in a swamp and about whom a newspaper had printed a curious article. Again he sought a small village in the Adirondacks whence reports of certain odd ceremonial practices had come. But still his parents forbade him the trip to the Old World which he desired.      Coming of age in April, 1923, and having previously inherited a small competence from his maternal grandfather, Ward determined at last to take the European trip hitherto denied him. Of his proposed itinerary he would say nothing save that the needs of his studies would carry him to many places, but he promised to write his parents fully and faithfully. When they saw he could not be dissuaded, they ceased all opposition and helped as best they could; so that in June the young man sailed for Liverpool with the farewell blessings of his father and mother, who accompanied him to Boston and waved him out of sight from the White Star pier in Charlestown. Letters soon told of his safe arrival, and of his securing good quarters in Great Russell Street, London; where he proposed to stay, shunning all family friends, till he had exhausted the resources of the British Museum in a certain direction. Of his daily life he wrote but little, for there was little to write. Study and experiment consumed all his time, and he mentioned a laboratory which he had established in one of his rooms. That he said nothing of antiquarian rambles in the glamorous old city with its luring skyline of ancient domes and steeples and its tangles of roads and alleys whose mystic convolutions and sudden vistas alternately beckon and surprise, was taken by his parents as a good index of the degree to which his new interests had engrossed his mind.      In June, 1924, a brief note told of his departure for Paris, to which he had before made one or two flying trips for material in the Bibliothque Nationale. For three months thereafter he sent only postal cards, giving an address in the Rue St. Jacques and referring to a special search among rare manuscripts in the library of an unnamed private collector. He avoided acquaintances, and no tourists brought back reports of having seen him. Then came a silence, and in October the Wards received a picture card from Prague, Czecho-Slovakia, stating that Charles was in that ancient town for the purpose of conferring with a certain very aged man supposed to be the last living possessor of some very curious mediaeval information. He gave an address in the Neustadt, and announced no move till the following January; when he dropped several cards from Vienna telling of his passage through that city on the way toward a more easterly region whither one of his correspondents and fellow-delvers into the occult had invited him.      The next card was from Klausenburg in Transylvania, and told of Wards progress toward his destination. He was going to visit a Baron Ferenczy, whose estate lay in the mountains east of Rakus; and was to be addressed at Rakus in the care of that nobleman. Another card from Rakus a week later, saying that his hosts carriage had met him and that he was leaving the village for the mountains, was his last message for a considerable time; indeed, he did not reply to his parents frequent letters until May, when he wrote to discourage the plan of his mother for a meeting in London, Paris, or Rome during the summer, when the elder Wards were planning to travel in Europe. His researches, he said, were such that he could not leave his present quarters; while the situation of Baron Ferenczys castle did not favour visits. It was on a crag in the dark wooded mountains, and the region was so shunned by the country folk that normal people could not help feeling ill at ease. Moreover, the Baron was not a person likely to appeal to correct and conservative New England gentlefolk. His aspect and manners had idiosyncrasies, and his age was so great as to be disquieting. It would be better, Charles said, if his parents would wait for his return to Providence; which could scarcely be far distant.      That return did not, however, take place until May, 1926, when after a few heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into New York on the Homeric and traversed the long miles to Providence by motor-coach, eagerly drinking in the green rolling hills, the fragrant, blossoming orchards, and the white steepled towns of vernal Connecticut; his first taste of ancient New England in nearly four years. When the coach crossed the Pawcatuck and entered Rhode Island amidst the faery goldenness of a late spring afternoon his heart beat with quickened force, and the entry to Providence along Reservoir and Elmwood avenues was a breathless and wonderful thing despite the depths of forbidden lore to which he had delved. At the high square where Broad, Weybosset, and Empire Streets join, he saw before and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant, remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town; and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down the terminal behind the Biltmore, bringing into view the great dome and soft, roof-pierced greenery of the ancient hill across the river, and the tall colonial spire of the First Baptist Church limned pink in the magic evening light against the fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous background.      Old Providence! It was this place and the mysterious forces of its long, continuous history which had brought him into being, and which had drawn him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no prophet might fix. Here lay the arcana, wondrous or dreadful as the case might be, for which all his years of travel and application had been preparing him. A taxicab whirled him through Post Office Square with its glimpse of the river, the old Market House, and the head of the bay, and up the steep curved slope of Waterman Street to Prospect, where the vast gleaming dome and sunset-flushed Ionic columns of the Christian Science Church beckoned northward. Then eight squares past the fine old estates his childish eyes had known, and the quaint brick sidewalks so often trodden by his youthful feet. And at last the little white overtaken farmhouse on the right, on the left the classic Adam porch and stately bayed facade of the great brick house where he was born. It was twilight, and Charles Dexter Ward had come home.5.      A school of alienists slightly less academic than Dr. Lymans assign to Wards European trip the beginning of his true madness. Admitting that he was sane when he started, they believe that his conduct upon returning implies a disastrous change. But even to this claim Dr. Willett refuses to accede. There was, he insists, something later; and the queernesses of the youth at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroad - odd enough things, to be sure, but by no means implying mental aberration on the part of their celebrant. Ward himself, though visibly aged and hardened, was still normal in his general reactions; and in several talks with Willett displayed a balance which no madman - even an incipient one - could feign continuously for long. What elicited the notion of insanity at this period were the sounds heard at all hours from Wards attic laboratory, in which he kept himself most of the time. There were chantings and repetitions, and thunderous declamations in uncanny rhythms; and although these sounds were always in Wards own voice, there was something in the quality of that voice, and in the accents of the formulae it pronounced, which could not but chill the blood of every hearer. It was noticed that Nig, the venerable and beloved black cat of the household, bristled and arched his back perceptibly when certain of the tones were heard.      The odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise exceedingly strange. Sometimes they were very noxious, but more often they were aromatic, with a haunting, elusive quality which seemed to have the power of inducing fantastic images. People who smelled them had a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas, with strange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite distance. Ward did not resume his old-time rambles, but applied himself diligently to the strange books he had brought home, and to equally strange delvings within his quarters; explaining that European sources had greatly enlarged the possibilities of his work, and promising great revelations in the years to come. His older aspect increased to a startling degree his resemblance to the Curwen portrait in his library; and Dr. Willett would often pause by the latter after a call, marvelling at the virtual identity, and reflecting that only the small pit above the pictures right eye now remained to differentiate the long-dead wizard from the living youth. These calls of Willetts, undertaken at the request of the senior Wards, were curious affairs. Ward at no time repulsed the doctor, but the latter saw that he could never reach the young mans inner psychology. Frequently he noted peculiar things about; little wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables, and the half-erased remnants of circles, triangles, and pentagrams in chalk or charcoal on the cleared central space of the large room. And always in the night those rhythms and incantations thundered, till it became very difficult to keep servants or suppress furtive talk of Charless madness.      In January, 1927, a peculiar incident occurred. One night about midnight, as Charles was chanting a ritual whose weird cadence echoed unpleasantly through the house below, there came a sudden gust of chill wind from the bay, and a faint, obscure trembling of the earth which everyone in the neighbourhood noted. At the same time the cat exhibited phenomenal traces of fright, while dogs bayed for as much as a mile around. This was the prelude to a sharp thunderstorm, anomalous for the season, which brought with it such a crash that Mr. and Mrs. Ward believed the house had been struck. They rushed upstairs to see what damage had been done, but Charles met them at the door to the attic; pale, resolute, and portentous, with an almost fearsome combination of triumph and seriousness on his face. He assured them that the house had not really been struck, and that the storm would soon be over. They paused, and looking through a window saw that he was indeed right; for the lightning flashed farther and farther off, whilst the trees ceased to bend in the strange frigid gust from the water. The thunder sank to a sort of dull mumbling chuckle and finally died away. Stars came out, and the stamp of triumph on Charles Wards face crystallised into a very singular expression.      For two months or more after this incident Ward was less confined than usual to his laboratory. He exhibited a curious interest in the weather, and made odd inquiries about the date of the spring thawing of the ground. One night late in March he left the house after midnight, and did not return till almost morning; when his mother, being wakeful, heard a rumbling motor draw up to the carriage entrance. Muffled oaths could be distinguished, and Mrs. Ward, rising and going to the window, saw four dark figures removing a long, heavy box from a truck at Charless direction and carrying it within by the side door. She heard laboured breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs, and finally a dull thumping in the attic; after which the footfalls descended again, and the four men reappeared outside and drove off in their truck.      The next day Charles resumed his strict attic seclusion, drawing down the dark shades of his laboratory windows and appearing to be working on some metal substance. He would open the door to no one, and steadfastly refused all proffered food. About noon a wrenching sound followed by a terrible cry and a fall were heard, but when Mrs. Ward rapped at the door her son at length answered faintly, and told her that nothing had gone amiss. The hideous and indescribable stench now welling out was absolutely harmless and unfortunately necessary. Solitude was the one prime essential, and he would appear later for dinner. That afternoon, after the conclusion of some odd hissing sounds which came from behind the locked portal, he did finally appear; wearing an extremely haggard aspect and forbidding anyone to enter the laboratory upon any pretext. This, indeed, proved the beginning of a new policy of secrecy; for never afterward was any other person permitted to visit either the mysterious garret workroom or the adjacent storeroom which he cleaned out, furnished roughly, and added to his inviolably private domain as a sleeping apartment. Here he lived, with books brought up from his library beneath, till the time he purchased the Pawtuxet bungalow and moved to it all his scientific effects.      In the evening Charles secured the paper before the rest of the family and damaged part of it through an apparent accident. Later on Dr. Willett, having fixed the date from statements by various members of the household, looked up an intact copy at the Journal office and found that in the destroyed section the following small item had occurred:Nocturnal Diggers Surprised inNorth Burial GroundRobert Hart, night watchman at the North Burial Ground, this morning discovered a party of several men with a motor truck in the oldest part of the cemetery, but apparently frightened them off before they had accomplished whatever their object may have been.      The discovery took place at about four oclock, when Harts attention was attracted by the sound of a motor outside his shelter. Investigating, he saw a large truck on the main drive several rods away; but could not reach it before the sound of his feet on the gravel had revealed his approach. The men hastily placed a large box in the truck and drove away toward the street before they could be overtaken; and since no known grave was disturbed, Hart believes that this box was an object which they wished to bury.      The diggers must have been at work for a long while before detection, for Hart found an enormous hole dug at a considerable distance back from the roadway in the lot of Amasa Field, where most of the old stones have long ago disappeared. The hole, a place as large and deep as a grave, was empty; and did not coincide with any interment mentioned in the cemetery records.      Sergt. Riley of the Second Station viewed the spot and gave the opinion that the hole was dug by bootleggers rather gruesomely and ingeniously seeking a safe cache for liquor in a place not likely to be disturbed. In reply to questions Hart said he thought the escaping truck had headed up Rochambeau Avenue, though he could not be sure.      During the next few days Ward was seldom seen by his family. Having added sleeping quarters to his attic realm, he kept closely to himself there, ordering food brought to the door and not taking it in until after the servant had gone away. The droning of monotonous formulae and the chanting of bizarre rhythms recurred at intervals, while at other times occasional listeners could detect the sound of tinkling glass, hissing chemicals, running water, or roaring gas flames. Odours of the most unplaceable quality, wholly unlike any before noted, hung at times around the door; and the air of tension observable in the young recluse whenever he did venture briefly forth was such as to excite the keenest speculation. Once he made a hasty trip to the Athenaeum for a book he required, and again he hired a messenger to fetch him a highly obscure volume from Boston. Suspense was written portentously over the whole situation, and both the family and Dr. Willett confessed themselves wholly at a loss what to do or think about it.6.      Then on the fifteenth of April a strange development occurred. While nothing appeared to grow different in kind, there was certainly a very terrible difference in degree; and Dr. Willett somehow attaches great significance to the change. The day was Good Friday, a circumstance of which the servants made much, but which others quite naturally dismiss as an irrelevant coincidence. Late in the afternoon young Ward began repeating a certain formula in a singularly loud voice, at the same time burning some substance so pungent that its fumes escaped over the entire house. The formula was so plainly audible in the hall outside the locked door that Mrs. Ward could not help memorising it as she waited and listened anxiously, and later on she was able to write it down at Dr. Willetts request. It ran as follows, and experts have told Dr. Willett that its very close analogue can be found in the mystic writings of \"Eliphas Levi\", that cryptic soul who crept through a crack in the forbidden door and glimpsed the frightful vistas of the void beyond:\"Per Adonai Eloim, Adonai Jehova,Adonai Sabaoth, Metraton On Agla Mathon,verbum pythonicum, mysterium salamandrae,conventus sylvorum, antra gnomorum,daemonia Coeli Gad, Almousin, Gibor, Jehosua,Evam, Zariatnatmik, veni, veni, veni.\"      This had been going on for two hours without change or intermission when over all the neighbourhood a pandaemoniac howling of dogs set in. The extent of this howling can be judged from the space it received in the papers the next day, but to those in the Ward household it was overshadowed by the odour which instantly followed it; a hideous, all-pervasive odour which none of them had ever smelt before or have ever smelt since. In the midst of this mephitic flood there came a very perceptible flash like that of lightning, which would have been blinding and impressive but for the daylight around; and then was heard the voice that no listener can ever forget because of its thunderous remoteness, its incredible depth, and its eldritch dissimilarity to Charles Wards voice. It shook the house, and was clearly heard by at least two neighbours above the howling of the dogs. Mrs. Ward, who had been listening in despair outside her sons locked laboratory, shivered as she recognised its hellish import; for Charles had told her of its evil fame in dark books, and of the manner in which it had thundered, according to the Fenner letters, above the doomed Pawtuxet farmhouse on the night of Joseph Curwens annihilation. There was no mistaking that nightmare phrase, for Charles had described it too vividly in the old days when he had talked frankly of his Curwen investigations. And yet it was only this fragment of an archaic and forgotten language: \"DIES MIES JESCHET BOENE DOESEF DOUVEMA ENITEMAUS\".      Close upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening of the daylight, though sunset was still an hour distant, and then a puff of added odour different from the first but equally unknown and intolerable. Charles was chanting again now and his mother could hear syllables that sounded like \"Yi-nash-Yog-Sothoth-he-lgeb-fi-throdog\" - ending in a \"Yah!\" whose maniacal force mounted in an ear-splitting crescendo. A second later all previous memories were effaced by the wailing scream which burst out with frantic explosiveness and gradually changed form to a paroxysm of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Mrs. Ward, with the mingled fear and blind courage of maternity, advanced and knocked affrightedly at the concealing panels, but obtained no sign of recognition. She knocked again, but paused nervelessly as a second shriek arose, this one unmistakably in the familiar voice of her son, and sounding concurrently with the still bursting cachinnations of that other voice. Presently she fainted, although she is still unable to recall the precise and immediate cause. Memory sometimes makes merciful deletions.      Mr. Ward returned from the business section at about quarter past six; and not finding his wife downstairs, was told by the frightened servants that she was probably watching at Charless door, from which the sounds had been far stranger than ever before. Mounting the stairs at once, he saw Mrs. Ward stretched at full length on the floor of the corridor outside the laboratory; and realising that she had fainted, hastened to fetch a glass of water from a set bowl in a neighbouring alcove. Dashing the cold fluid in her face, he was heartened to observe an immediate response on her part, and was watching the bewildered opening of her eyes when a chill shot through him and threatened to reduce him to the very state from which she was emerging. For the seemingly silent laboratory was not as silent as it had appeared to be, but held the murmurs of a tense, muffled conversation in tones too low for comprehension, yet of a quality profoundly disturbing to the soul.      It was not, of course, new for Charles to mutter formulae; but this muttering was definitely different. It was so palpably a dialogue, or imitation of a dialogue, with the regular alteration of inflections suggesting question and answer, statement and response. One voice was undisguisedly that of Charles, but the other had a depth and hollowness which the youths best powers of ceremonial mimicry had scarcely approached before. There was something hideous, blasphemous, and abnormal about it, and but for a cry from his recovering wife which cleared his mind by arousing his protective instincts it is not likely that Theodore Howland Ward could have maintained for nearly a year more his old boast that he had never fainted. As it was, he seized his wife in his arms and bore her quickly downstairs before she could notice the voices which had so horribly disturbed him. Even so, however, he was not quick enough to escape catching something himself which caused him to stagger dangerously with his burden. For Mrs. Wards cry had evidently been heard by others than he, and there had come from behind the locked door the first distinguishable words which that masked and terrible colloquy had yielded. They were merely an excited caution in Charless own voice, but somehow their implications held a nameless fright for the father who overheard them. The phrase was just this: \"Sshh! - write!\"      Mr. and Mrs. Ward conferred at some length after dinner, and the former resolved to have a firm and serious talk with Charles that very night. No matter how important the object, such conduct could no longer be permitted; for these latest developments transcended every limit of sanity and formed a menace to the order and nervous well-being of the entire household. The youth must indeed have taken complete leave of his senses, since only downright madness could have prompted the wild screams and imaginary conversations in assumed voices which the present day had brought forth. All this must be stopped, or Mrs. Ward would be made ill and the keeping of servants become an impossibility.      Mr. Ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for Charless laboratory. On the third floor, however, he paused at the sounds which he heard proceeding from the now disused library of his son. Books were apparently being flung about and papers wildly rustled, and upon stepping to the door Mr. Ward beheld the youth within, excitedly assembling a vast armful of literary matter of every size and shape. Charless aspect was very drawn and haggard, and he dropped his entire load with a start at the sound of his fathers voice. At the elder mans command he sat down, and for some time listened to the admonitions he had so long deserved. There was no scene. At the end of the lecture he agreed that his father was right, and that his noises, mutterings, incantations, and chemical odours were indeed inexcusable nuisances. He agreed to a policy of greater quiet, though insisting on a prolongation of his extreme privacy. Much of his future work, he said, was in any case purely book research; and he could obtain quarters elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be necessary at a later stage. For the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed the keenest contrition, and explained that the conversation later heard was part of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental atmosphere. His use of abstruse technical terms somewhat bewildered Mr. Ward, but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and poise despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity. The interview was really quite inconclusive, and as Charles picked up his armful and left the room Mr. Ward hardly knew what to make of the entire business. It was as mysterious as the death of poor old Nig, whose stiffening form had been found an hour before in the basement, with staring eyes and fear-distorted mouth.      Driven by some vague detective instinct, the bewildered parent now glanced curiously at the vacant shelves to see what his son had taken up to the attic. The youths library was plainly and rigidly classified, so that one might tell at a glance the books or at least the kind of books which had been withdrawn. On this occasion Mr. Ward was astonished to find that nothing of the occult or the antiquarian, beyond what had been previously removed, was missing. These new withdrawals were all modern items; histories, scientific treatises, geographies, manuals of literature, philosophic works, and certain contemporary newspapers and magazines. It was a very curious shift from Charles Wards recent run of reading, and the father paused in a growing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense of strangeness. The strangeness was a very poignant sensation, and almost clawed at his chest as he strove to see just what was wrong around him. Something was indeed wrong, and tangibly as well as spiritually so. Ever since he had been in this room he had known that something was amiss, and at last it dawned upon him what it was.      On the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the house in Olney Court, but to the cracked and precariously restored oils of the large Curwen portrait disaster had come. Time and unequal heating had done their work at last, and at some time since the rooms last cleaning the worst had happened. Peeling clear of the wood, curling tighter and tighter, and finally crumbling into small bits with what must have been malignly silent suddenness, the portrait of Joseph Curwen had resigned forever its staring surveillance of the youth it so strangely resembled, and now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust.", "\"You fool, Warren is DEAD!\"As soon as the demonic and bestial voice had finished its horrifying utterance, my fear, which had spent the last several minutes of my final, despairing conversation with Warren in a state of suspended animation waiting in vain to hear of my friends hopeful escape, spread from my chest to my head and from there, spread like a cold sensation through my veins, filling me with a terrified despairing sensation that I had never experienced before. I was paralyzed by my fear. My legs gave out, and I collapsed on the floor of the tomb. Suddenly the blackness closed in, and I knew no more.I woke up the next day to the muted yet familiar smell of sterilized linens. After my disorientation dissipated, I realized that I had been taken to the local hospital. From Warrens research into the entrance to the netherworld, we had discovered that the areas surrounding the entrances were feared by local peoples, and were feared and avoided.A mild sense of comfort filled me as I realized that whatever entity had taken my friend from this mortal realm had not escaped its netherworld lair. Its words haunted my thoughts, resonating in my mind like a bell. Shortly after my awakening, a nurse entered my room to tell me that the sheriff had asked for me.Soon after, a stout, short man entered the room. He had a worried look on his face. I could tell that whatever he wanted to discuss with me was done with great reluctance and anxiety. He stuttered through a short introduction, his name being Alan Graham. He had said he had found me after he had received reports from some of the local people near the graveyard, that two grave robbers had been trespassing onto the forbidden lands. He had found me unconscious in the tomb, but had not seen or heard anything. He was obviously spooked by the dilapidated structures in the swamp and had taken me to the hospital. He asked me of what happened to the man that witnesses saw me enter the swamp with.I was filled with an inhumane dread at the thought of telling the oblivious detective of my experience in the graveyard. However, I braved through my fear, though had to take several pauses to avoid becoming overcome with fear and passing out again. By the time, I had finished, Graham had begun sobbing uncontrollably, He had started shaking as big, wet tears dropped down his face. Though I dont understand why, he had believed my tale. Graham told me that I could leave, as long as I didnt go back to the graveyard. I agreed, heaving no desire to return the horror that had taken Warren from this life.The next four months of my life were haunted by nightmares of the disembodied voice talking to me through the grave. Though I attempted to forget that night, my mind would always take me back to the graveyard. While my mind was filled with immense terror of what I had observed, I was so curious as to what Warren had unearthed in that hidden necropolis. The thoughts of the latter slowly consumed my thoughts, and I was unable to function in society. I was resolved to find out what Warren had unearthed. However, I was aware of the danger I faced, and decided I would go back by myself. If I died, I would take the knowledge of the location of the portal to the underworld with me.I returned the following autumn, having read up on the lore that Warren had kept hidden me, from my own protection. The tomes he had uncovered told tales of the monstrous demons that could travel between the underworld and the surface one. The tomes were mostly undecipherable to me, as my linguistic ability was not strong enough to decipher the archaic texts. However, I was able to make out the basic information, though none of the stories told me of a way to prevent being killed or how to hide myself from the undead beings.Despite the bleakness of my remaining mortality, my curiosity of the hidden world that only a few mortals had ever seen grew stronger and stronger, dominating my thoughts. I knew I had to return, even though I would likely die.When I returned to the cemetery, I was unsurprised that everything had remained completely the same. The equipment Warren and I had brought had remained untouched, the telephone wire still being in place. My mind quickly focused on Warren, would I discover his remains, if the demons had even left his body? I removed the black slab covering the entrance, though it too much longer than when I had Warren helping me. Nevertheless, I was able to move the stone. However, I was only able to budge it so that it would eventually close on the doorway, trapping me inside.Though I knew my life would be lost, my curiosity had taken over me, and I knew that until I had seen what horrors or wonder were hidden beneath the tomb, I could not find peace. So, I set off into the darkness. These are the final thoughts I have before I leave this world. To whoever discovers this note next to this other worldly gateway, the horrors beneath this tomb have consumed my life, and for your sake, I pray that you do not become entrapped into its ethereal mystique as I have. Run, you fool, run, before you are trapped in spirit and in body as I am! Run, before the obsession takes over your every waking thought! Leave!- Randolph Carter"]}
{"id": "EN060", "pair": ["Hanoi, Socialist Republic of VietnamJune 24, 2011.\"Hey, were here. Get up if you dont want to wake up in Hue!\"Joseph Clayton was shaken awake by the hand of one of his classmates on his shoulder. He was sitting in the back of a taxi van... the only one left sitting, actually, as the others had already disembarked to enter the government office they were parked in front of.Which probably meant that he was left to pay the fare.After he payed (as seemed to be his lot on this trip), he followed his classmates and his professor into the government office where they hoped to finally receive their travel permits. He hadnt gotten much of sleep on the plane; a mixture of excitement in the face of overseas travel and sheer jet-lag had conspired to leave him weary and light headed until he got a few hours sleep, which the taxi ride had partially afforded him.And in that sleep...The dream had come as a stark, clear memory. When Marie had said that she wasnt going to join him at the Miskatonic campus in Arkham for what would be their first year of university, he had been devastated. His first questions, rushed and frantic, had been about the cause of such a change. She certainly had the SAT score to qualify and student debt could be handled with relative ease. Had she decided to forgo post-secondary to concentrate on her stake in the restaurant? Had financial problems struck and prevented admissions from being paid?Was it something about him?Her answers, far more controlled than his frenzied speculation, had all been in the negative. Her SAT scores were good, student loans were still open and she still intended to go for a degree in Biology at Miskatonic. It was just... after shed gotten that phonograph from her parents home village, the repayment had been a promise to come and spend a year back in the \"Old Country\" as soon as she could. It would only be for a year and then she would return, ready for university and all accompaniments.That had been very nearly one year before. She had promised him that she would be coming back in the summer of 2011... but after she had arrived in Vietnam, all contact had stopped cold. Her parents, when asked about her condition, always responded with affirmations that she would return and that she was fine... but as winter wore onto spring, subtle hints of doubt and worry had crept into their voices. Had they even been receiving any news from their daughter and if not, then why not? Had something gone terribly wrong?As it happened, more baffling events awaited inside.\"What do you mean, restricted?\" Joseph asked the Communist Party bureaucrat sitting across the desk from him. Of course, due to the facts that first, said bureaucrat was a government employee and second, they were not alone in the room, Joseph had been careful not to sound too brunt in his tone. A trung sior Sergeant, wearing the forest green uniform of the Vietnam Border Defence Force (VPA), stood by the door of the office, both watching and guarding.Relieved at being able to shed his stilted English after Joseph exhibited a decent grasp of the Vietnamese language, the bureaucrat put forth what he knew of the situation. \"Civilian access is almost completely denied inside the area you requested. To be honest, that section of the border has been troublesome ever since the war. We get reports of smugglers, poachers, bandits, Hmong insurgents... every type of violent counter-revolutionary you can think of, this region seems to have it. The local Bru farmers arent much help, but they generally dont bother others and seem to accept the military presence we keep there.\" The bureaucrat shifted his gaze from Joseph to Professor Neville Andover, the leader of this particular expedition. \"Im sorry, but theres nothing that can be done without high level authorization.\"As a response to this, Neville Andover did not get upset. He did not resign himself to failure. He did not even try to ask if there was any other avenue of entry or way to access the information he needed. He just donned an odd, amused smile, the corners of his eyes crinkling behind his wire rim glasses. \"I assume that General Vo is still the Secretary for the Border Forces?\" He asked, almost distractedly. When the official answered yes, Professor Andover reached into the inside of his light cotton jacket and pulled out a small, metal case. From this case, he removed a single paper card of purest black, embossed with an emerald green \"Delta\" symbol and a capital \"Y\" of gold in the center of that hollow triangle. \"I have been in contact with Comrade Vo for the last six months, planning this expedition as an act of cooperation between our two governments and as a boon for my University. He knows that card; show it or describe it to him... you maywant to run it by General Tran as well. Either way, they will give you the answer you need.\"As the bureaucrat took the card and then as the Border Defense sergeant took it from him and headed out of the room, Joesph wondered about his professor and the oddities that surrounded him. The first time he had ever seen the Professor, it had been in his High School Auditorium as Marie had performed the Stork Dance... and Joseph had noticed strange things. In their senior year of High School, both he and Marie had received reference letters to Miskatonic University in Arkham, a town in Essex county. When he had arrived at Miskatonic (without Marie), he had been shocked that the professor for his Cultural Anthropology class was not only the one who had given him his reference but was also the man who had he had seen three years before.And then there were his classmates, three of whom had also come on this expedition. Many of them had received similar letters from Prof. Andover and most of those, though not relaying specifics, had said that they had found the circumstances equally strange. Two who had gotten references were on this very trip with them. The first was Tracy Williams from the farm country of Northwest Virginia, a girl with blond hair quite a few shades lighter than Josephs own brassy brown and the class Nippon-Nut, being both obsessed with Anime and Manga as well as being Japanese-proficient. The second was Albert Noyes, a young man who has part white, part black and a little Algonquin-Indian from a small hamlet in southern Vermont. His specialties were technology, math and Mandarin Chinese. The third member of retinue was a young man named Malone who... frankly, was a mystery to the entire class. However, he had volunteered for this trip and his grades had been excellent so his place on the roster had been assured.But there was still a nagging question at the back of his mind: why? Why had they received offers to go to an obscure if admittedly exceptional regional university when the big names had all passed them over? Why had they been gathered from all across the United States by a single professor? And why, it seemed, did it feel like there was such a big connection between the missing member of Dr. Andovers \"collection\" and the reason behind this expedition?Why did it feel as if Marie was somehow connected to this?Eventually, the sergeant came back and informed the bureaucrat of General Vos express permission for the Professor and his students to enter the exclusion zone as well as General Trans confirmation, before handing the card back to Neville Andover. Joseph knew that academics could sometimes have friends in high and unusual places, but counting on ... no, expecting the approval of not just one, but two ranking Generals in a non-allied nation? This seemed crazy, certifiably insane even.But then, so did spectral storks and spoonbills.Northernmost Quang Binh Province, Socialist Republic of VietnamJune 29, 2011Despite the calm look on the professors face, something about the current situation made Joseph Clayton distinctly ill at ease.They had spent the last two days trudging up into the Annamite mountains after leaving the fertile coastal plain. At the last village with road access, they had ditched their vehicles and backpacked up the ridges and trails, counting on a guide from the local Bru people to lead them to... whatever Prof. Andover was looking for. The fact that the guide was now legging it quite quickly back down the misty path told Joseph that something had either gone incredibly wrong or incredibly right.Now, Neville Andover was chanting, seemingly trying to communicate with something deep in the thick underbrush on either side of the worn, overgrown gully that had been called a trail. The language was almost intellig ible to Joseph, being a form of Mon-Khmer linked to the classical Vietnamese he had studied, perhaps with a few hints of Muong intermixed. However, the syntax and grammer were archaic to say the least. From some of the words used it even seemed to be achingly familiar, almost as if...With a sudden realization of shock and the smell of grilled pork and Bac Bon Dzhow a memory in his nostrils, Joseph realized where he had encountered this form of Vietic before.But the shocks were not over.Spun around by Albert Noyes to see something, Joseph gazed upward to see a human figure standing upon the high bank, glancing down at them with hard, measuring eyes. Undoubtedly masculine, the figure was of a man of slightly darker skin than the farmers of the coast (though the features were similar) and of greater height than either them or the native Bru. Clothed only in a white cotton kilt with geometric designs in black and a leather girdle, this man carried a white flatbow decorated with bands of green, blue and red while a bronze dagger rested at his hip. His head was shaved of all hair, and black designs were tattooed from the crown of the scalp to the jawline, with more tattoos covering his arms, chest and lower legs.The fact that an arrow was nocked in the string of his bow put the four young people on edge, with Malone and Joesph himself tightening the grips on the hilts of their machetes in anticipation of a hopeless fight. More men in similar dress and tattoos, some with bronze slashing swords, some with bronze-headed spears and others with flatbows, appeared out of the forest on either side of them. Now that Joseph could get a better look at them in the dim light filtering down through the forest canopy and the mist, their arm tattoos began looking very similar to those borne by Maries parents while those on their faces, while different in design, were still similar in form.All the while, Prof. Andover kept up the low chanting, of which Joseph could pick out individual words: \"friend\", \"gods\", \"village\", \"priest\", \"comrade\" and at least one invocation of Ho Chi Minh among them. To this, these strange men seemed to confer with each other though glances and nods before took one took a short, bamboo tube from his girdle, put one end to his mouth, took a deep breath and blew.As the silvery-blue powder erupted from the tube, settled on the heads of the trekking academics and they each lost consciousness in turn, Joseph wondered if this could get any worse.Meanwhile, Spoonbill VillageTsan Pho Dao had been the Chief Priest of this village for many years, ever since the death of his father in the closing days of the American War. In that span of years, he had seen many futures and advised his people based on those futures. He had called down both ruin and plenty by invoking the power of the gods of his people. He alone, in a feat outside even the power of the hereditary village chiefs, had communicated with the Instrument of their gods, a being possessed of both boundless knowledge and an absolutely rotten temper. He also, most importantly, had an absolutely perfect memory of his entire life... and that of his father, and his father before him.To be perfectly honest, he held a tremendous amount of power within this village. The ancestor shrines belonged to families while the hunters had their own little shrines up the mountain where midnight rituals were performed to gather poison for the tips of arrows and darts. But those rituals needed to be performed by the minor priests under his command. This temple was the spiritual center of his people for most of the year and the temple with its darkened wood walls lit only by feeble braziers whose light was twisted by the smoke of rare and powerful incenses, with its figurines of gods and demons carved from nephrite and jadeite brought from deep below the earth... was his domain. His and no one else. He divined the future when possible, he performed the rites and as a result, it was he who had taken countless lives in sacrifice over the course of his adulthood: chickens, pigs, goats, buffalo... people.As he sat at a low table in his private sanctuary, trying to divine some course for a question that had faced him for most of a year, he noticed something. One of the golden discs he used for divination, a coin looted from a Chinese caravan many centuries ago, stood up on its rim and began to roll. Following the curve of failing momentum, the coin finally came to rest at a specific point on the table, a place that held indication of the future.Visitors... and not the \"ketchup\" kind of visitors.Several Hours Later, Close to the Laos BorderThe answer to Joseph Claytons earlier question was a definite yes. When he had awoken, he had found his wrists and ankles bound, the bindings looped over a pole carried by two men with him and the other students suspended like deer carcasses. The Professor, on the other hand, had not been bound, but had found transport by sitting in a large basket suspended from one of the poles by a cord, carried by a pair of men. They had been going downhill from the crest of a ridge and were now leaving the forest, coming onto a road. First, they passed under a wooden gate where roosting spoonbills had been carved into the posts and a sun flanked by two dragons had been carved into the beams above the road.Then Joseph saw where they were headed. A village of perhaps thirty houses was visible in the valley bottom while narrow terraces had been cut into the hills above, green with growing rice. The view quickly vanished as the men began heading into the village itself but sight was soon replaced with sound. The quiet of the forest was supplanted by the cacophony of a hundred sounds: chickens and pigs grunted and clucked as the animals rooted below the houses and around the garbage heaps while odd-looking reddish dogs, lazing in the sun on the porches of the outermost houses, whined in surprise at the new arrivals. The sounds of tools and primitive machinery clunked melodiously. The sounds of people also were audible: talking, laughing, shouting and even a few low notes of womens work songs were possible for Joseph to pick out of the general buzz... a buzz which also included Albert trying to reason with their captors and Tracy displaying an unusually foul mouth toward same.Soon, people began to notice the men bringing in captives and a few even began to gather along the path as they entered the village, joining their dogs (or Dholes, as they were now identifiable as) who had come to sniff. It was mostly men, older boys and children who came out to watch while the women and the elderly usually went no further than windows and the porches of the stilt-houses that lined the road. Here, even hanging upside down, Joseph could notice a few things about the dress and appearance of the peopleFrankly... it was a bit odd.From what he knew, the Vietnamese national costume (in its modern form) placed a heavy emphasis on trousers, an item of clothing that he noticed was rather conspicuously absent here. Everyone here seemed to be wearing variations on one basic outfit in either brown or black: knee-length cotton kilts, short-sleeved cotton jackets (mostly with their front fastenings closed) and either rough-woven conical hats or simple cloths tied over their heads. The mens hair appeared to be cut short to the point where one could vaguely make out the tattoos on their scalp while children varied between the same shortness for boys and a single, long braid for the girls.Eventually they arrived in a great or square before what appeared to be the temple: a ponderous structure of wood and brick perched upon massive stone foundations, its sloping roofs flaring outward as if to shroud the surrounding houses from the scrutiny of the heavens. Around them, a crowd had gathered on all sides, an air of excitement buzzing in the air. Men exited the house across the square from the temple entrance and despite the calm demeanour of Professor Andover, words began filtering through to Joseph that began sounding more and more disturbing; words like \"kill\", \"sacrifice\" and \"ritual\". But another word came, one that sent darker imaginings and images rambling through his sensation-saturated mind.The word \"eat\".\"WAIT! STOP!\"Joseph knew those words as well... as well as that voice!Out of the crowd rushed a figure dressed much like the others: brown kilt and jacket, the latter partially open to reveal a yem undergarment and with a straw hat on her head. As Joseph finally began taking in other details, he noticed the tattooed lines and whimsical designs on her lower legs and arms and on her face, lines and vaguely triangular patterns that almost resembled the features of an orangutan.Her face... behind all the tattooing, the face of this woman was still as unmistakable to Joseph as the first day they had met in Kindergarten. To this sudden recognition, the young man could only exclaim his surprise as a soothingly familiar name.\"Marie?\"", "1945, 10 years after Smifts abduction. InnsmouthA man was running in a dark town. The chasers were holding torches and pitchforks. \"Go die you human scum!\" one of them growled, the young man was about to fire a pistol to this antagonistic chord when a knife reached the back of this heart. Before he could die he saw these enemies more closely, looking similar to humans, even using casual suits, but this faces were slightly distorted, with a bluish tinge and big eyes. These hands were very close to being webbed. One of them reaches the pockets of the corpses clothes, finding a diary with a logo in the middle: Miskatonic University.The next day. at Miskatonic, Massachusetts, Wilhelm Smift was very old, at the age of 68. He was in a bed resting this very frail body. He was accompanied by this young friend Johnathan Clarke. \"My dear friend, due to the fact that I will die, and I never had a family before…I will give to you the weapon that can protect humanity from the unknown. But please, pass some of my blood to you so he can perceive you as a member of my family, also you dont need to worry, my blood is not ill, I figured out that the Infinitely Timed Room makes you die of old age once you exited it, and due to the fact that my wife never could give me a child…and she is deceased, you will be my new successor\" Clarke used a syringe and injected some of the blood of this predecessor into himself. And then Wilhelm Smift died. The young would be teacher found himself sad, he knows that this mentor had told him of the physical god he mastered. But he wanted to learn more about not only physics but the alien technology as well, but he always told him that \"this mind would crack\" but how such an old fellow acquired such knowledge and remained sane? He departed to the basement, he knows that such places are only allowed to certain people, but Smift had told him that if he declared himself this son he would pass. The place was light by a single torch. To find a tall humanoid structure close to him, this shadow taller than any man he has seen. \"So my master had passed away…such a pity, I wanted to serve him more than no one.\" The voice was sly, and with a sharp tone. As this mentor said, but right now he sounded…sad? \"He was a great man, and me? Only an fucking killer…heh, its funny…how the good can die, alone and unnoticed…and they stay dead.\" he noticed John \"who we have here?\" he stared at the young man and in turn he noticed the mechanical being before him: this main body was cylindrical and red, with a single crimson cat like eye in the center of this \"head\" this arms have white with red colorations like the rest of this limbs, he had a large rectangular shield in this left arm, a set of three small red pouches and in the right a knife holder and the left a pistol holder, and a white cloth skirt. \"What is doing a brat in my home?\" he tried this best to gather mental strength and answer: \"I am the…son of Wilhelm Smift, he told me you would serve me\" the beast looked at him with this single blood colored eye, \"I can see trough you…and that is true, the Smift blood is in you kid, I mean master\" then the monster grabbed this pistol and started to show it at this server, \"so tell me, what shall I do? I am capable for killing anything\" he young man tried this best to organize this words and asks: \"why do you look different from what my father told me?\" the creature chuckles and says: \"heh, isnt it obvious? I wanted to look different cause I dont want to look like the jackasses that wanted me gone. They made this suit look like a fuckin asylum inmate . I was looking for something that suited me, so I left my dimension for one day. And I saw the perfect one, this one, why do you ask? cause I wanted a new look that minds insurrection?\" he pointed this white finger at the young man, that eye…its just like the devil itself was looking at him. \"And the eye?\" \"Oh…that was my…personal touch\" he started to laugh and this companion started to tremble. \"Dont be afraid kid…I dont bite, for much that I want to.\" Azathoth pointed at this \"face\" revealing that he doesnt have a mouth. Then he started to laugh like a maniac. He kid got out of the basement in fear. \"Hey dont get out! I was about to have tell you a great joke! MASTER!\"The next day…\"sire, we have bad news, Roy Urkam has…died\" a messenger told to this young chief, \"and who is that man, messenger?\" Clarke asks, \"He was a freelance investigator. He heard that something strange happened in Innsmouth so we sent him there, when I came this corpse was on a stick on the end of the road, when I asked they said: \"just a couple of kids that did it\" it was obvious that was a lie.\" The kid was…shocked but after scare from yesterday this was nothing. Suddenly a car was coming to the entrance, the occupants got out, they have guns and their eyes had watered eyes that were slightly out of their sockets. And they forced the main door down, \"thank god there are not students!\" the sire said, Clarke rushed to the basement and yelled the name of this protector and servant. \"INVASORS! COME AND KILL THEM! THEY HAVE GUNS!\" the young man yelled. \"Calm down master, I will go kick their skulls\" he got out of this dark lair and he readied this colt pistol and this knife. \"Come here! I can sense cowardly in this place!\" suddenly a blaze of bullets came from the outside of the campus. \"I think I need a bigger gun\" he turned this back and then a rectangular and red colored heavy machine gun was grabbed from this holster, the weapon was so tall as the cylinder body of this user and it looked different from any gun ever made: it had a slightly bended square in this top. This barrel had holes and this body was metallic instead of wood. Then he got out of the building and he saw these enemies \"Deep ones!\" they started to fire but it was useless, the bullets just bounce this tick metal skin. He started firing and he shot 4, the other ones tried to run to the car. \"NO YOU WONT!\" Azathoth yelled and he used this incredible strength and stomped the vehicle. \"Now we can start this party!\" the half deep ones tried to counter attack with this pistols but nothing changed. Azathoth grabbed one and crushed this skull with these bare hands, he shot three to death with this colt and machine gun; he blazed 1 to death with a thick cylindrical magenta/red heat ray that emanated from this crimson eye. \"COME ON! GIVE ME A CHALENGE!\" he yelled, and then he realized that only one was left. \"Oh…damn I wanted a massacre. Well my good friend, come here\" but before he can grab this new prisoner a bullet came to this skull, Azathoth saw that 2 more cars came. \"Oh…YES MORE FUN!\" he welcomed this new \"guests\" with this heat ray; a few ones changed their ammo and used armor piercing. The bullets were now making dents in the body of the armored god. But then they started to self-repair. \"YES, this is the real deal!\" he did 4 head shots and destroyed the two cars that came with this heat ray, some of the half fish men tried to enter the house from the back, but they saw with horror a large creature with a vertical mouth and large pink eyes located in both parts of the divided head, he had two right arms fused into one and two left that were identical, with large nails. The main body was shaggy with black and some purple hair. \"What in Dagons name is that!\" one of them asked before being eaten by the giant. The ex-outer god was enjoying like a maniac that the cars that he fried had some occupants and they got out of them showered in flames \"THATS WHAT I CALL EXTRA CRISPY!\" the daemon yelled to this frightened fish enemies. Only 5 were left and they tried to run to the exit, but before that can happen Azathoth flicked this finger and the giant vertical mouth monster appeared and lunged to the remaining ones and eaten them. Only one was left…again. \"Gug, go were you belong\" Azathoth flicked this fingers again and the monstrosity disappeared. \"Thanks CLAXTON, thanks Bertie\" he returned to the university. It had some gun holes but nothing that can be easily repaired.\"Hey master, are you in one piece?\" he asked to the young that was in the ground. He grabbed the shocked boy and handed him to the messenger. Put him in this home. He grabbed the survivor knocked him down with a flick of this finger and put him in the jail of the basement \"Well…that was exiting\""]}
{"id": "EN076", "pair": ["Northernmost Quang Binh Province, Socialist Republic of VietnamJuly 2, 2011Two young adults walked up the path beside the bronze-casters shop to the barren hillside and the forest edge beyond. \"So, how do you like things so far?\" Marie asked as she and Joseph made their way up the rough-hewn stone steps. Their destination was the house of the village woodcutter and charcoal-burner, a place that also doubled as a furniture workshop and, importantly for this journey, the villages firearms armory.\"Not that bad. Ive been doing domestic work for the past few days but neither Noc nor his wife seems to really be a slave driver. Actually, they feel more like people who understand that theyre training a new servant.\" Joseph thought on something. \"Im actually surprised that he and the other hunters allowing me to accompany them. They neither seem to respect me or anyone who would stoop to use a gun, so I wonder why they changed their attitude.\"It was here that Marie began ruminating on something, an old thought that had given her more than her share of bad dreams. \"There are some things worth surrendering pride for, Joseph. Tell me, have you seen those weird scars on the ankles and arms of Nocs wife?\"\"You mean those marks that look like Giant Squid wounds? Yes, but what about them?\" Joseph suddenly stopped. \"What are they, anyway?\"Having stopped also, Marie sighed, a sense of foreboding covering her features. \"When I asked that myself, they didnt tell me much more than the stories Id already heard when I was a kid: legends about ghosts, devils from the mist, shadows that drink blood is what they called them sometimes. But what I got here is that those Shugoran priests that saved my people werent just going to somewhere. They were running ifrom/i somewhere, someone or something, something that no one is willing to talk any further about.\" Marie started forward again at such a pace that her boyfriend had to hurry to catch up.Getting the feeling that nothing more was going to be answered on that subject for a good while, Joseph changed track. \"How are the others getting on? Ive been stuck in the house most of the day and I havent really had a chance to talk to either the Prof or my classmates.\"Happy to shift from thoughts of chilling horror, Marie chuckled with increasing mirth as she began going back up the trail. \"From what Ive heard, Alberts been filming every step in the bronze making process that he can, not to mention all the casting processes and various uses of equipment. The only reason that he hasnt been thrown out yet is because the familys elder patriarch has taken a liking to… well, not just him, but all of you guys, just from the descriptions alone. Your Professor and his assistant have basically locked themselves in the temple: no word out yet, but I assume that theyre observing normal operations. As for Tracy…\" Here, Marie began acting a little odd. \"She talks in her sleep, if you didnt know.\"\"Really?\" Joseph responded interestedly. Not reacting the way that she had feared, Marie relaxed a little from the paranoia she had been wrangling with.\"Yeah, and the strange thing is that its in… well, tree-ish. And then theres the tattooing on her back as well.\" Marie went on talking, relieved that her fear seemed to have been senseless.Before he could answer his girlfriends increasingly chatty descriptions, a thought crossed Josephs mind on exactly why such a thing might be mentioned. \"Why would you ask me if I knew…\" Then the realization hit him and he stopped cold. \"Were you thinking that… Tracy and I?\"Marie stopped as well. \"Its not unknown to happen, you know.\" Marie answered the implied question almost defensively, as if trying to justify her momentary paranoia. \"Sweethearts get separated and sometimes… one finds companionship elsewhere. Especially with, you know.\" Marie tapped the side of her head, indicating the \"visitors\" that had first cursed Joseph Claytons existence during High School.Joseph snorted in an amused, disparaging way. \"Please dont give them that much credit. Ive ignored, rebuked and insulted those jerks so many times that Ive made a virtual bloodsport out of it. Besides, if Id made any moves towards Tracy, Albert would have killed me.\"\"Wait, those two… theyre together?\" Marie asked, wondering how shed missed that.\"Intimately so, yes.\" This was all Joseph was willing to say, himself not wishing to examine too closely the memory of walking in on his dorm-mate and his girl when they had neglected to put a sock on the doorknob. \"Anyway, as to these voices, I went to the psychology department to see if I could discover just what was causing it.\"Marie waited a heartbeat before plunging into the vital question. \"And what did they say?\" If her boyfriend did indeed have Schizophrenia, then he needed help: drugs to control the symptoms and perhaps therapy to help him conquer whatever dark corners of his psyche were feeding these voices.If it was something else… then perhaps the local sorcerers might need to be consulted before long.Joseph sighed. Whatever is going on inside my head, the geeks with the scanning equipment are pretty sure that this isnt a case of medical Schizophrenia. They say that the symptoms are all wrong, the voices arent persuasive enough… and that I dont have any of the telltale injuries on the brain that would suggest medical reasons. And then there was the time they hooked me up to the EEG during one of my episodes.\" He paused, wondering just how to proceed but, since he was already experiencing strange things, he decided just to press on. \"The guys swore that, before the equipment shorted out, at least two additional wavelengths were being read beside mine.\" With a shrug, Joseph summed up his thoughts. \"Ever since I came here and heard all of the seemingly crazy stories from you and the others… I dont know, but what Ive gone through just makes sense now, at least in knowing that it actually can happen.\"Marie smiled. Yes, we definitely need to consult the priests. \"Come on, weve talked enough and you need to get that rifle before you head out.\"And rifles there were, all secured inside a triple locked room in the back corner of the woodcutters house. They looked like Berthier carbines, French bolt-action repeaters from the First World War… but they were not the only guns present. \"Is that a Hotchkiss?\" Joseph asked in a voice combining bemusement and astonishment. Among the rifles and a few, scattered revolvers sat a machine-gun still on its tripod and looking impossibly well-maintained for being kept in the back room of a house located in a tropical moist forest.\"An M1914 by the looks of it, if the pictures Ive seen are at all accurate. Theres a story behind it, but I only know that only the oldest elders know it.\" Marie replied, having picked up of the Berthier Carbines and handing it to Joseph. The ammunition was kept in a chest under a trapdoor in the main part of the house as a safety measure so theyd have to go back to pick it up. But then she asked the question that she probably should have asked before they left the village proper. \"Speaking of guns, since when did you shoot?\"\"Theres a gun range in Arkham; Tracy and Albert invited me along for a few lessons before Thanksgiving. Shes the one with actual hunting experience and I think he only came along to check out the engineering on the pieces. It wasnt that much fun, but I think what I learned in getting my license will help on this.\" Joseph began inspecting the carbine he had been given, finding it oiled and well-maintained as any other firearm in the room. There was a question that had to be asked, however?Where did they get all these guns?b15 minutes Later/bMarie walked up the stairs to her grandparents house. She was supposed to act as a translator and informant for the expedition, having prior contacts inside the community and being a member first by blood and more recently by initiation. Truth be told, she had a feeling that old Tsan was really acting as gatekeeper in his interactions with Professor Andover while she was playing the part of a more convenient and mobile ambassador, Tsan having never left the temple save by palanquin in almost forty years.Walking in the door, Marie was unprepared for another surprise. She saw Tracy sitting before the camera as her Grandmother and Aunt watched, waiting to begin filming the days questions and activities, even making a short introductory statement... but not in English.\"And as soon as the translator gets here, well begin the second day of... Hey Marie, you almost scared me there.\" Here was an audible note of guilt as Tracy hastily switched from the strange language that she had been using to the carefully modulated, Patsy Cline-accented English she had used since Marie had met her. Marie had heard it, and Tracy knew that she had heard... and Marie knew that Tracy knew.\"Yeah, Ive gotten that reaction a few times since I got here.\" Marie joked, knowing that humor had the power to break tension. \"So... what language were you speaking in anyway? Im afraid I didnt recognize anything about it.\" Her female elders watched closely, knowing that something had happened but being ignorant of other languages, were unsure of exactly what.Tracy grinned bitterly. \"Id be more surprised if you did recognize it. Its... well, its not really a language per se, but a patois of a couple languages, with Early Modern English, Ohio Valley Shawnee, Coastal Algonquian, some Iroquoian loanwords having to do with ritual and bits of Eastern Siouan.\" Tracy let out the deep breath she had been using to list all those languages. She was getting more comfortable now. \"I guess it wont do any harm if I told you, seeing as were almost in the same boat.\"Tracy beckoned Marie to sit, turning off the camera as she did. \"The kids in my town learn it... well, sort of as a first language; English is really more of a first-and-a-half language for us. We got exposed to it through TV and then when we went to school, but most of our formative years were spent listening to and absorbing the patois around the house. Most of us never really let go of it as a language for our own private conversations.\"Marie reflected on this... but was also noting some of the features on Tracys face: the high, rounded cheeks, her high-bridged nose, the way that her eyes were less the bright crystal blue of stereotype and more of a dark, cloudy blue resembling ultramarine. \"I hope you dont mind me saying this, Tracy but does your family have any Native American ancestry? I dont mean to pry, but you do kind of have the look.\"Tracy considered this for a moment before giving an affirmative nod. \"My fathers paternal grandmother was from the Oklahoma Kiowa. My mother, as far as can be traced, is also about an eighth, this time one-eighth Shawnee, which seems to be the median for Longhouse.\" She got an odd, contemplative look on my face. \"Thats another one of those things that we try not to mention to outsiders, even though they tend to notice it anyway. Back in the old days, admitting it would have been a quick ticket to using a segregated washroom or worse. And now?\" Tracy shrugged. \"Now its considered cool, while the inbreeding still makes us look like freaks.\"Marie decided to test something, just for her own sake. \"Albert doesnt seem to think youre a freak.\" The more she thought about it, she had more in common with Tracy than first realized. Both of them had lived life right on the edge of themselves and their kin being recognized as something other, something foreign to the perceived natural order of the world. Both of them could sense the threat of possible revelation... and knew what it was to try to trust someone with these secrets.\"Hey, youre talking about a guy whose family has worked for alien mushroom bugs for the last hundred years. A bit of mild inbreeding is probably the most normal thing Als ever experienced.\" Here there was definitely affection to her voice, a cue that no matter what other strangeness they were involved in, there was a loving relationship between the two.At this thought Marie smiled, thanking the ancestors for a little bit of normalcy in this year-long cavalcade of oddities that she had flung herself into. Then another question sprang forth. \"Did you know about the whole alien thing when you guys were at Miskatonic?\"Tracy shook her head. \"No, but then again, he was always kinda spacey.\" Marie couldnt help but giggle at this bad pun. Tracy went on, the affection still in her voice. \"Seriously, the thing about Miskatonic is that, after awhile, you begin getting the feeling that almost everyone else is holding something close to their chest, thinking each word over before saying it. Its then that you realize that... youre not alone, that almost everyone else is as paranoid as you are, having something to hide.\" She looked towards Marie. \"Everyone except for your Joseph, that is. The only thing strange about him that I noticed was that romance was nowhere on his radar at all.\"\"Youd be surprised, actually.\" Marie answered cryptically. Before Tracy could ask, she turned back the camera back on, signaling the beginning of the interview session.That eveningSweaty, hot, dirty and exhausted, Joseph Clayton exited the forest with Noc and the other hunters. Between all of them, the hunters had brought down a Sambar stag and three small muntjacs. Joseph, for his part, had escaped being gored by a wild boar only by dodging its charge, rolling into a hollow under a log and then shooting it in the head at point-blank range when it tried to go after him. For this feat, the hunters designated him \"master of the pit\" when they roasted it at tonights feast. It had sounded like an honorable title, but Joseph could guess that they were making him little more than a cook, a traditionally female position.Still, it was an in and it would probably be research gold.He was entirely less enthusiastic about what else was coming back with them.When he and the group of hunters came into the village proper, he saw Marie and the taller, paler form of Tracy coming towards him, having been up on the family terrace transplanting rice seedlings. Due to her fair skin, Tracy was wearing the largest hat she could while her arms and shins had been slathered with sunblock. Marie had already taken hers off.As they neared him, Marie slowed to a stop, seeing the grim look on Josephs face. Tracy looked at her in confusion, then at Joseph and from his stony face understood that something was wrong. \"What is it?\" Marie asked her boyfriend.Joseph sighed. \"When the hunters brought us in, were we supposed to be for any kind of important sacrifice?\"\"Well, the Rhinoceros Festival is supposed to happen any day now. Its when we recharge the mist that surrounds the village to keep us hidden.\" Marie looked around Joseph to where one of the hunters was leading a group of people into the village. They looked like quite a bedraggled bunch, many of them thin and in questionable health. There were also two women who may have been considered beautiful if not for the look in their eyes that they had been through several levels of hell before coming here.But for all these conditions, they did not look frightened of their tattooed guides.Noticing where Marie was looking, Joseph offered explanation. \"We met up with them about a mile down the trail. Apparently the government sent up street people as some fresh blood for you guys. And thats not all. Apparently...\" Here, he lowered his voice \"One of the families that were living incognito in Vinh got killed a few nights ago: Father, mother, twelve year old boy... from what I heard it sounded like some sort of animal tore them up inside their apartment... and no blood was spilled.\"Tracy looked like she was going to vomit at the news, while a look of dread overcame Marie, as old legends came forth out of the terrifying mist of childhood nightmare to become shadows in the waking world. \"Is there anything else?\" Marie asked quietly.Now it was Josephs turn to look back at the party coming out of the forest, which were now carrying a man by his hands and feet on a pole, his mouth gagged and his eyes blindfolded. \"Only that they also sent you a sacrifice. From what they said, hes a drug-runner, sexual slaver and a general bad example of low-level underworld scum.\"Marie, still in shock over the news of the murders, was perhaps not picking and choosing the words coming out of her mouth. \"Which mean hes gonna taste worse than the fish sauce.\"At these words, both gruesome and almost ridiculous, both her lover and her friend goggled at her.", "May 19th, 1929,Miskatonic University, Arkham, Mass.In all honesty, the manner which Robert Olmstead exited the Chancellors office was not the most graceful to be seen in the history of Miskatonic University. However, perhaps \"exited\" is too neutral a term for a man being forcibly escorted out the double doors by two University proctors with a firm grasp on his forearms. \"Ejected\" is probably a good description though \"assaulted\" would have a good chance of being upheld by a court. As Mr. Olmstead was finally shoved out into the hall, he finally lost his balance and fell to his knees, the voluminous robes which he had worn since his arrival seeming to weigh him down.As Hiriam Willows and Brian Fife rushed out of the office and hastened to Roberts side, the man himself seemed... tired, drained of energy and showing signs of a fatigue that had been present since the meeting had began. Still, Mr. Olmstead managed to raise his head to address Chancellor Douglas Gooding, who was still in his office. \"I take it... negotiations have ended.\" Robert said this in as controlled a way as possible, trying to ignore the irritation at the back of his throat and the sides of his neck.\"Negotiations, as you call them, never began.\" Chancellor Gooding, a patrician of a man at the age of 57, had risen from behind his desk and was now walking toward the spot where Mr. Olmstead has stood and presented his case. \"This College has been handed a chance to claim credit for discovering the root devices behind most, if not all, of vertebrate biology and promises to make careers for many of our staff and students. Unless the Navy, who has graciously allowed access to its prisoners for this purpose, decides to either withdraw that access or, as you suggest, release them back into the general population, I see no reason why they should not remain under our supervision in their current quarters.\" Gooding eyes fell upon the floor where Robert had stood... and the staff that now lay on the floor. It was a strange thing: the matter itself almost resembled gray, petrified wood but in places its form showed characteristics of crustacean carapace or of the strange shapes present in fishbone or shark-jaw and, when the light hit it just so, the surface displayed a luster more akin to Nautilus shell or Mother of Pearl than any of those things.Gooding, in a sudden fit of antiquarian fascination, began kneeling down to take the strange rod. \"However, if you could tell us about this staff...\" Just as his the tips of his fingers brushed against the smooth surface the staff, seemingly under its own power, jerked butt-first towards the door, skidding over the floors polished hardwood planks. When it reached Robert. who was now being helped to his feet by Professor Fife, the staff actually began tipping up on its butt, the shaft guiding itself into Roberts limp, open hand.Grasping the staff to regain his posture, Robert glanced once more at Gooding. \"The staff is a secret that keeps itself. As to my plea... if that is your decision, I pray that you do not live to reap the whirlwind.\"\"Is that a threat?\" Chancellor Gooding was losing patience rapidly after this manifestation of the strange had made an intrusion into his office and annoyance was threatening to turn to anger.\"Merely a warning, good Chancellor.\" These were the last words that Robert Olmstead spoke to Gooding as Fife, carrying the papers that Olmstead had presented, helped him as he unsteadily walked down the hallway, supported by his implement.Just as Hiriam Willows was about to follow the pair, Gooding called to him. \"Hiriam! Get back in this office!\" Willows, his eyes continuing to follow his two companions down the hall for a moment, turned and walked back into the Chancellors office with a tightening of the lips and the speed of a slow stroll, more amenable to his aging legs than the fast walk he had so recently exerted himself with. \"Im surprised, Douglas.\"\"Surprised that I called you back in here?\" Asked Gooding as he sat back down behind his desk.\"That we are apparently operating on a first name basis now. As I recall, that has not been our habit since nineteen hundred and... seven, was it?\" It may have been facetious (to say the least) in bringing this up but after today, last winter and, to be honest, most days since Gooding had restricted Willows to a single morning class per week, he and the Chancellor has not quite been on the best of terms.\"Ah yes, the Cuba business. However... actually, that ispart of why I called you in here.\" Gooding pointed an almost accusatory finger at the older man. \"As I recall, youwere the one to countermand my decision to use force against those two Voodoo cults in Las Tunas.\"\"First of all, they were Santeria practitioners. Second, I was able to forge an armistice between the two warring factions and convince them to give up their murderous ways...\"\"In favor of continued use of animal sacrifice, I remember, I remember.\" Gooding put that accusatory finger to his temple as if to calm a throbbing. Then that finger returned to the standing faculty member. \"But whether youre French or Spanish does not mean much of anything when youre trying to rip open a portal to the tenth dimension, summoning dangerous ichors and vapors from beyond and, may I remind you, trying to violently murderas many people as needed for their insane goals. Hiriam... I know that youre a Quaker, I knowthat negotiating between groups of violent, degenerate heathens has always been your strong point, but this is something radicallydifferent.\"The Chancellor noticed Willows disbelieving roll of the eyes but continued. \"These... things have been present in and off the coast of Essex Country for the better part of a century. Theyve killed people, they subverted local government, through their negligence the port of Innsmouth nearly crumbled due to neglect... not to mention that theyve potentially forced themselves on local residents due to the existence of apparently hybrid individuals!\" He motioned out the door and pointed in the direction that Olmstead and Fife had exited. \"Did you happen to take a good look at the person who was just ejected from this office? My God Hiriam, the man was practically turning into a herring before our very eyes!\" Gooding seemed to calm down a bit. \"I know you were always one to try to see both sides of the argument, to resolve conflicts through calm deliberation... but this wasntnegotiation. This was a demand backed by veiled threats. I remember you being much sterner in the face of demands than this.\" There was a thoughtful pause. \"What happened in Virginia, Hiriam? Ever since you got back, youve been at your usual quest for cooperation between man and eldritch forces except... moreso.\"A hundred images flashed in Willows mind of that December in the Luray Valley. The little clusters of field-stone houses and barns around the southern tip of Mt. Ida; the lean-faced Quaker farm-folk; the walk through the community cemetery and the graves of his mothers family, the Caulfields. The children, so desperate to experience a properly Victorian Christmas in pageantry unknown by the community, inviting him to a snowball fight and following his lead in decorating and games (which he had found invigorating at the time). The experience of being around others of his faith for the first time in decades.But there was also the first time he had ever been forced to kill, as a .45 caliber ACP round hit dead center on his war-painted assailant in the mountain forests. The moment when he had discovered the small shrine beneath the Longhouse Meeting Hall with its black deer hides, Eastern Elk antlers and strange mix of artifacts. The sight of his hosts sacrificing pigs, wailing and dancing in the manner of the Seneca Iroquois at an isolated stone circle south along the mountains from the Armys battle with their foes, mourning for all the dead who would be brought out. And two of the bodies brought back, an apparent pair of adult twin sisters in matching warpaint who had charged the federal troops with knives before being mowed down: their hands had been intertwined even as fire from Thompson submachineguns had demolished their ribcages, the agony of their situation apparent from their found journals... the swelling around their eyes under the paint indicative of weeping.Hiriam shrugged as if he experienced nothing. \"Just a bit of reconnection with my mothers side of the family. Now, if you will excuse me?\" Before Gooding could even respond, Hiriam Willows walked out of the office and closed the doors behind him, exhaling in relief before he continued on to Professor Fifes office.Shortly, Professor Fifes OfficeBrian Fife sighed in frustration and concern as he dabbed the side of Robert Olmsteads neck with a handkerchief soaked in ice water. \"When was the last time you bothered to moisten the reservoir layers in this cloak? Any longer without adequate water around the gills and you would have been coughing up blood.\"Robert, sitting in a chair across from Fife, was now much less weary now that relief was being applied. \" There was no time. I had to act quickly to try to get them released and the last two days have been a flurry.\"\"Well, its just as well that I keep ice and water in my study or you would have...\" Fife was interrupted by Hiriam Willows entry into the office who, upon entering, simply asked himself how a militant like Douglas Gooding had become chancellor. Fifes answer to this question was concise. \"Well, Masterson died of Diphtheria while in Shanghai, Harvey has his Cocaine habit, Peaslee isnt totally trusted after that Yith business and yourefused to take any oath of office acceptable to the Congregationalist clergy. Gooding was the only member of the senior faculty with the necessary respectability left.\" \"Thank you very much. Now, what do we do next?\" Hiriam sat down in another chair, forming a semicircular huddle as he addressed Olmstead. \"Gooding isnt going to budge an inch without a proper prodding, the Arkham Police are beginning to take note of your lodgings at the Miskatonic Hotel and your current appearance which, may I remark, is becoming more piscine by the day, will not inspire confidence in the other involved parties.\"\"Then we have to properly prod. I have to prod. I owe that much at least.\" Robert, now that his neck and gills were properly wetted (and the kelp layers under his robe properly inundated with cold water), became quiet, both hands still across his lap, grasping the staff he had carried since he had arrived.Fife knew what he was thinking, for it was also close to his heart. \"Robert, you dont have to do this. The Priests of Yha-Nthlei wont judge you harshly if you dont bring home any more of our people than your cousin; I know its tragic, but its happened before that people have been lost to the surface world.\"Robert suddenly got a hard look in his eyes and stared directly at the other man. \"Do you know what it feels like to lose your parents, your child, your neighbors or friends? To not know where they were taken? To fear for their lives while they might be undergoing hideous, nefarious tortures? And then, one day, you are suddenly confronted with the grinning idiot who, in his disgust and primordial fear, ensured your loved ones capture and now, while you are forced to hide like a crab in the sand, are expected to welcome this fool into your ranks?\"He groaned at the memory... or even more than the memory. \"The punishment for my loutish treachery was harsh, but even a flayed back will not absolve all I have done, all I have seen. My flogging will not return parents to children or husbands to wives. My pain will not sooth the fear of mothers for their sons. And the welts upon my back will not make me forget the accusation, the pain... the sorrowin their eyes. I am doing this as much for myself as for them; doing it so that I wont have to live with my failures for an eternity.\" Willows and Fife were quiet until Fife quietly asked \"So, what now?\"\"If I cant do anything, the warriors will be swimming upstream in less than a week. When they get here... I cant promise that anyone will be safe.\" Robert looked pensive, a calculating look on his face. \"We... Iwill have to make an impression in front of Gooding. Somewhere public, somewhere will it will make an impression that cant be dismissed or ignored. Anything come to mind?\"It was then that it struck Hiriam. \"Of course, the regatta tomorrow! Gooding will be attendance, he hasto be in attendance according to College statutes. But what are you going to do?\"Having been asked, Robert began to think. \"I assume itll be on the Miskatonic?\"\"Where else? Hangmans Brook has never been deep enough for rowing and the University never affluent enough to construct a canal.\" Fife explained.\"Will there be many other people there?\" Robert asked again, something beginning to form in his already-changed brain.\"Everyone who can: students, alumni, dock workers, beggars... why do you ask?\" Hiriam was now curious as to this whole thing.Robert looked down at the staff in his hands, feeling the smooth surface but also feeling the power coursing through the object. The Staff of Dagon... said to have been wielded by their king and blessed by the mighty Priest to whom Dagon and Hydra had sworn loyalty. Once, it had been said to have performed wonders.Once... and perhaps again."]}

A Nightmare and a Cataclysm1.And now swiftly followed that hideous experience which has left its indelible mark of fear on the soul of Marinus Bicknell Willett, and has added a decade to the visible age of one whose youth was even then far behind. Dr. Willett had conferred at length with Mr. Ward, and had come to an agreement with him on several points which both felt the alienists would ridicule. There was, they conceded, a terrible movement alive in the world, whose direct connexion with a necromancy even older than the Salem witchcraft could not be doubted. That at least two living men - and one other of whom they dared not think - were in absolute possession of minds or personalities which had functioned as early as 1690 or before was likewise almost unassailably proved even in the face of all known natural laws. What these horrible creatures - and Charles Ward as well - were doing or trying to do seemed fairly clear from their letters and from every bit of light both old and new which had filtered in upon the case. They were robbing the tombs of all the ages, including those of the worlds wisest and greatest men, in the hope of recovering from the bygone ashes some vestige of the consciousness and lore which had once animated and informed them.      A hideous traffick was going on among these nightmare ghouls, whereby illustrious bones were bartered with the calm calculativeness of schoolboys swapping books; and from what was extorted from this centuried dust there was anticipated a power and a wisdom beyond anything which the cosmos had ever seen concentrated in one man or group. They had found unholy ways to keep their brains alive, either in the same body or different bodies; and had evidently achieved a way of tapping the consciousness of the dead whom they gathered together. There had, it seems, been some truth in chimerical old Borellus when he wrote of preparing from even the most antique remains certain \"Essential Saltes\" from which the shade of a long-dead living thing might be raised up. There was a formula for evoking such a shade, and another for putting it down; and it had now been so perfected that it could be taught successfully. One must be careful about evocations, for the markers of old graves are not always accurate.      Willett and Mr. Ward shivered as they passed from conclusion to conclusion. Things - presences or voices of some sort - could be drawn down from unknown places as well as from the grave, and in this process also one must be careful. Joseph Curwen had indubitably evoked many forbidden things, and as for Charles - what might one think of him? What forces \"outside the spheres\" had reached him from Joseph Curwens day and turned his mind on forgotten things? He had been led to find certain directions, and he had used them. He had talked with the man of horror in Prague and stayed long with the creature in the mountains of Transylvania. And he must have found the grave of Joseph Curwen at last. That newspaper item and what his mother had heard in the night were too significant to overlook. Then he had summoned something, and it must have come. That mighty voice aloft on Good Friday, and those different tones in the locked attic laboratory. What were they like, with their depth and hollowness? Was there not here some awful foreshadowing of the dreaded stranger Dr. Allen with his spectral bass? Yes, that was what Mr. Ward had felt with vague horror in his single talk with the man - if man it were - over the telephone!      What hellish consciousness or voice, what morbid shade or presence, had come to answer Charles Wards secret rites behind that locked door? Those voices heard in argument - \"must have it red for three months\" - Good God! Was not that just before the vampirism broke out? The rifling of Ezra Weedens ancient grave, and the cries later at Pawtuxet - whose mind had planned the vengeance and rediscovered the shunned seat of elder blasphemies? And then the bungalow and the bearded stranger, and the gossip, and the fear. The final madness of Charles neither father nor doctor could attempt to explain, but they did feel sure that the mind of Joseph Curwen had come to earth again and was following its ancient morbidities. Was daemoniac possession in truth a possibility? Allen had something to do with it, and the detectives must find out more about one whose existence menaced the young mans life. In the meantime, since the existence of some vast crypt beneath the bungalow seemed virtually beyond dispute, some effort must be made to find it. Willett and Mr. Ward, conscious of the sceptical attitude of the alienists, resolved during their final conference to undertake a joint secret exploration of unparalleled thoroughness; and agreed to meet at the bungalow on the following morning with valises and with certain tools and accessories suited to architectural search and underground exploration.      The morning of April 6th dawned clear, and both explorers were at the bungalow by ten oclock. Mr. Ward had the key, and an entry and cursory survey were made. From the disordered condition of Dr. Allens room it was obvious that the detectives had been there before, and the later searchers hoped that they had found some clue which might prove of value. Of course the main business lay in the cellar; so thither they descended without much delay, again making the circuit which each had vainly made before in the presence of the mad young owner. For a time everything seemed baffling, each inch of the earthen floor and stone walls having so solid and innocuous an aspect that the thought of a yawning aperture was scarcely to be entertained. Willett reflected that since the original cellar was dug without knowledge of any catacombs beneath, the beginning of the passage would represent the strictly modern delving of young Ward and his associates, where they had probed for the ancient vaults whose rumour could have reached them by no wholesome means.      The doctor tried to put himself in Charless place to see how a delver would be likely to start, but could not gain much inspiration from this method. Then he decided on elimination as a policy, and went carefully over the whole subterranean surface both vertical and horizontal, trying to account for every inch separately. He was soon substantially narrowed down, and at last had nothing left but the small platform before the washtubs, which he had tried once before in vain. Now experimenting in every possible way, and exerting a double strength, he finally found that the top did indeed turn and slide horizontally on a corner pivot. Beneath it lay a trim concrete surface with an iron manhole, to which Mr. Ward at once rushed with excited zeal. The cover was not hard to lift, and the father had quite removed it when Willett noticed the queerness of his aspect. He was swaying and nodding dizzily, and in the gust of noxious air which swept up from the black pit beneath the doctor soon recognised ample cause.      In a moment Dr. Willett had his fainting companion on the floor above and was reviving him with cold water. Mr. Ward responded feebly, but it could be seen that the mephitic blast from the crypt had in some way gravely sickened him. Wishing to take no chances, Willett hastened out to Broad Street for a taxicab and had soon dispatched the sufferer home despite his weak-voiced protests; after which he produced an electric torch, covered his nostrils with a band of sterile gauze, and descended once more to peer into the new-found depths. The foul air had now slightly abated, and Willett was able to send a beam of light down the Stygian hole. For about ten feet, he saw, it was a sheer cylindrical drop with concrete walls and an iron ladder; after which the hole appeared to strike a flight of old stone steps which must originally have emerged to earth somewhat southwest of the present building.2.      Willett freely admits that for a moment the memory of the old Curwen legends kept him from climbing down alone into that malodorous gulf. He could not help thinking of what Luke Fenner had reported on that last monstrous night. Then duty asserted itself and he made the plunge, carrying a great valise for the removal of whatever papers might prove of supreme importance. Slowly, as befitted one of his years, he descended the ladder and reached the slimy steps below. This was ancient masonry, his torch told him; and upon the dripping walls he saw the unwholesome moss of centuries. Down, down, ran the steps; not spirally, but in three abrupt turns; and with such narrowness that two men could have passed only with difficulty. He had counted about thirty when a sound reached him very faintly; and after that he did not feel disposed to count any more.      It was a godless sound; one of those low-keyed, insidious outrages of Nature which are not meant to be. To call it a dull wail, a doom-dragged whine, or a hopeless howl of chorused anguish and stricken flesh without mind would be to miss its most quintessential loathsomeness and soul-sickening overtones. Was it for this that Ward had seemed to listen on that day he was removed? It was the most shocking thing that Willett had ever heard, and it continued from no determinate point as the doctor reached the bottom of the steps and cast his torchlight around on lofty corridor walls surmounted by Cyclopean vaulting and pierced by numberless black archways. The hall in which he stood was perhaps fourteen feet high to the middle of the vaulting and ten or twelve feet broad. Its pavement was of large chipped flagstones, and its walls and roof were of dressed masonry. Its length he could not imagine, for it stretched ahead indefinitely into the blackness. Of the archways, some had doors of the old six-panelled colonial type, whilst others had none.      Overcoming the dread induced by the smell and the howling, Willett began to explore these archways one by one; finding beyond them rooms with groined stone ceilings, each of medium size and apparently of bizarre uses. Most of them had fireplaces, the upper courses of whose chimneys would have formed an interesting study in engineering. Never before or since had he seen such instruments or suggestions of instruments as here loomed up on every hand through the burying dust and cobwebs of a century and a half, in many cases evidently shattered as if by the ancient raiders. For many of the chambers seemed wholly untrodden by modern feet, and must have represented the earliest and most obsolete phases of Joseph Curwens experimentation. Finally there came a room of obvious modernity, or at least of recent occupancy. There were oil heaters, bookshelves and tables, chairs and cabinets, and a desk piled high with papers of varying antiquity and contemporaneousness. Candlesticks and oil lamps stood about in several places; and finding a match-safe handy, Willett lighted such as were ready for use.      In the fuller gleam it appeared that this apartment was nothing less than the latest study or library of Charles Ward. Of the books the doctor had seen many before, and a good part of the furniture had plainly come from the Prospect Street mansion. Here and there was a piece well known to Willett, and the sense of familiarity became so great that he half forgot the noisomeness and the wailing, both of which were plainer here than they had been at the foot of the steps. His first duty, as planned long ahead, was to find and seize any papers which might seem of vital importance; especially those portentous documents found by Charles so long ago behind the picture in Olney Court. As he searched he perceived how stupendous a task the final unravelling would be; for file on file was stuffed with papers in curious hands and bearing curious designs, so that months or even years might be needed for a thorough deciphering and editing. Once he found large packets of letters with Prague and Rakus postmarks, and in writing clearly recognisable as Ornes and Hutchinsons; all of which he took with him as part of the bundle to be removed in his valise.      At last, in a locked mahogany cabinet once gracing the Ward home, Willett found the batch of old Curwen papers; recognising them from the reluctant glimpse Charles had granted him so many years ago. The youth had evidently kept them together very much as they had been when first he found them, since all the titles recalled by the workmen were present except the papers addressed to Orne and Hutchinson, and the cipher with its key. Willett placed the entire lot in his valise and continued his examination of the files. Since young Wards immediate condition was the greatest matter at stake, the closest searching was done among the most obviously recent matter; and in this abundance of contemporary manuscript one very baffling oddity was noted. The oddity was the slight amount in Charless normal writing, which indeed included nothing more recent than two months before. On the other hand, there were literally reams of symbols and formulae, historical notes and philosophical comment, in a crabbed penmanship absolutely identical with the ancient script of Joseph Curwen, though of undeniably modern dating. Plainly, a part of the latter-day programme had been a sedulous imitation of the old wizards writing, which Charles seemed to have carried to a marvellous state of perfection. Of any third hand which might have been Allens there was not a trace. If he had indeed come to be the leader, he must have forced young Ward to act as his amanuensis.      In this new material one mystic formula, or rather pair of formulae, recurred so often that Willett had it by heart before he had half finished his quest. It consisted of two parallel columns, the left-hand one surmounted by the archaic symbol called \"Dragons Head\" and used in almanacks to indicate the ascending node, and the right-hand one headed by a corresponding sign of \"Dragons Tail\" or descending node. The appearance of the whole was something like this, and almost unconsciously the doctor realised that the second half was no more than the first written syllabically backward with the exception of the final monosyllables and of the odd name Yog-Sothoth, which he had come to recognise under various spellings from other things he had seen in connexion with this horrible matter. The formulae were as follows - exactly so, as Willett is abundantly able to testify - and the first one struck an odd note of uncomfortable latent memory in his brain, which he recognised later when reviewing the events of that horrible Good Friday of the previous year.YAI NGNGAH,YOG-SOTHOTHHEE - LGEBFAI THRODOGUAAAH      \tOGTHROD AIFGEBL - EEHYOG-SOTHOTHNGAHNG AIYZHROSo haunting were these formulae, and so frequently did he come upon them, that before the doctor knew it he was repeating them under his breath. Eventually, however, he felt he had secured all the papers he could digest to advantage for the present; hence resolved to examine no more till he could bring the sceptical alienists en masse for an ampler and more systematic raid. He had still to find the hidden laboratory, so leaving his valise in the lighted room he emerged again into the black noisome corridor whose vaulting echoed ceaselessly with that dull and hideous whine.      The next few rooms he tried were all abandoned, or filled only with crumbling boxes and ominous-looking leaden coffins; but impressed him deeply with the magnitude of Joseph Curwens original operations. He thought of the slaves and seamen who had disappeared, of the graves which had been violated in every part of the world, and of what that final raiding party must have seen; and then he decided it was better not to think any more. Once a great stone staircase mounted at his right, and he deduced that this must have reached to one of the Curwen outbuildings - perhaps the famous stone edifice with the high slit-like windows - provided the steps he had descended had led from the steep-roofed farmhouse. Suddenly the walls seemed to fall away ahead, and the stench and the wailing grew stronger. Willett saw that he had come upon a vast open space, so great that his torchlight would not carry across it; and as he advanced he encountered occasional stout pillars supporting the arches of the roof.      After a time he reached a circle of pillars grouped like the monoliths of Stonehenge, with a large carved altar on a base of three steps in the centre; and so curious were the carvings on that altar that he approached to study them with his electric light. But when he saw what they were he shrank away shuddering, and did not stop to investigate the dark stains which discoloured the upper surface and had spread down the sides in occasional thin lines. Instead, he found the distant wall and traced it as it swept round in a gigantic circle perforated by occasional black doorways and indented by a myriad of shallow cells with iron gratings and wrist and ankle bonds on chains fastened to the stone of the concave rear masonry. These cells were empty, but still the horrible odour and the dismal moaning continued, more insistent now than ever, and seemingly varied at times by a sort of slippery thumping.3.      From that frightful smell and that uncanny noise Willetts attention could no longer be diverted. Both were plainer and more hideous in the great pillared hall than anywhere else, and carried a vague impression of being far below, even in this dark nether world of subterrene mystery. Before trying any of the black archways for steps leading further down, the doctor cast his beam of light about the stone-flagged floor. It was very loosely paved, and at irregular intervals there would occur a slab curiously pierced by small holes in no definite arrangement, while at one point there lay a very long ladder carelessly flung down. To this ladder, singularly enough, appeared to cling a particularly large amount of the frightful odour which encompassed everything. As he walked slowly about it suddenly occurred to Willett that both the noise and the odour seemed strongest directly above the oddly pierced slabs, as if they might be crude trap-doors leading down to some still deeper region of horror. Kneeling by one, he worked at it with his hands, and found that with extreme difficulty he could budge it. At his touch the moaning beneath ascended to a louder key, and only with vast trepidation did he persevere in the lifting of the heavy stone. A stench unnamable now rose up from below, and the doctors head reeled dizzily as he laid back the slab and turned his torch upon the exposed square yard of gaping blackness.      If he had expected a flight of steps to some wide gulf of ultimate abomination, Willett was destined to be disappointed; for amidst that foetor and cracked whining he discerned only the brick-faced top of a cylindrical well perhaps a yard and a half in diameter and devoid of any ladder or other means of descent. As the light shone down, the wailing changed suddenly to a series of horrible yelps; in conjunction with which there came again that sound of blind, futile scrambling and slippery thumping. The explorer trembled, unwilling even to imagine what noxious thing might be lurking in that abyss, but in a moment mustered up the courage to peer over the rough-hewn brink; lying at full length and holding the torch downward at arms length to see what might lie below. For a second he could distinguish nothing but the slimy, moss-grown brick walls sinking illimitably into that half-tangible miasma of murk and foulness and anguished frenzy; and then he saw that something dark was leaping clumsily and frantically up and down at the bottom of the narrow shaft, which must have been from twenty to twenty-five feet below the stone floor where he lay. The torch shook in his hand, but he looked again to see what manner of living creature might be immured there in the darkness of that unnatural well; left starving by young Ward through all the long month since the doctors had taken him away, and clearly only one of a vast number prisoned in the kindred wells whose pierced stone covers so thickly studded in the floor of the great vaulted cavern. Whatever the things were, they could not lie down in their cramped spaces; but must have crouched and whined and waited and feebly leaped all those hideous weeks since their master had abandoned them unheeded.      But Marinus Bicknell Willett was sorry that he looked again; for surgeon and veteran of the dissecting-room though he was, he has not been the same since. It is hard to explain just how a single sight of a tangible object with measureable dimensions could so shake and change a man; and we may only say that there is about certain outlines and entities a power of symbolism and suggestion which acts frightfully on a sensitive thinkers perspective and whispers terrible hints of obscure cosmic relationships and unnamable realities behind the protective illusions of common vision. In that second look Willett saw such an outline or entity, for during the next few instants he was undoubtedly as stark mad as any inmate of Dr. Waites private hospital. He dropped the electric torch from a hand drained of muscular power or nervous cordination, nor heeded the sound of crunching teeth which told of its fate at the bottom of the pit. He screamed and screamed and screamed in a voice whose falsetto panic no acquaintance of his would ever have recognised; and though he could not rise to his feet he crawled and rolled desperately away over the damp pavement where dozens of Tartarean wells poured forth their exhausted whining and yelping to answer his own insane cries. He tore his hands on the rough, loose stones, and many times bruised his head against the frequent pillars, but still he kept on. Then at last he slowly came to himself in the utter blackness and stench, and stopped his ears against the droning wail into which the burst of yelping had subsided. He was drenched with perspiration and without means of producing a light; stricken and unnerved in the abysmal blackness and horror, and crushed with a memory he never could efface. Beneath him dozens of those things still lived, and from one of the shafts the cover was removed. He knew that what he had seen could never climb up the slippery walls, yet shuddered at the thought that some obscure foot-hold might exist.      What the thing was, he would never tell. It was like some of the carvings on the hellish altar, but it was alive. Nature had never made it in this form, for it was too palpably unfinished. The deficiencies were of the most surprising sort, and the abnormalities of proportion could not be described. Willett consents only to say that this type of thing must have represented entities which Ward called up from imperfect salts, and which he kept for servile or ritualistic purposes. If it had not had a certain significance, its image would not have been carved on that damnable stone. It was not the worst thing depicted on that stone - but Willett never opened the other pits. At the time, the first connected idea in his mind was an idle paragraph from some of the old Curwen data he had digested long before; a phrase used by Simon or Jedediah Orne in that portentous confiscated letter to the bygone sorcerer: \"Certainely, there was Nothg butt ye liveliest Awfulness in that which H. raisd upp from What he coud gather onlie a part of.\"      Then, horribly supplementing rather than displacing this image, there came a recollection of those ancient lingering rumours anent the burned, twisted thing found in the fields a week after the Curwen raid. Charles Ward had once told the doctor what old Slocum said of that object; that it was neither thoroughly human, nor wholly allied to any animal which Pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about.      These words hummed in the doctors mind as he rocked to and fro, squatting on the nitrous stone floor. He tried to drive them out, and repeated the Lords Prayer to himself; eventually trailing off into a mnemonic hodge-podge like the modernistic Waste Land of Mr. T. S. Eliot and finally reverting to the oft-repeated dual formula he had lately found in Wards underground library: \"Yai ngngah, Yog-Sothoth\", and so on till the final underlined \"Zhro\". It seemed to soothe him, and he staggered to his feet after a time; lamenting bitterly his fright-lost torch and looking wildly about for any gleam of light in the clutching inkiness of the chilly air. Think he would not; but he strained his eyes in every direction for some faint glint or reflection of the bright illumination he had left in the library. After a while he thought he detected a suspicion of a glow infinitely far away, and toward this he crawled in agonised caution on hands and knees amidst the stench and howling, always feeling ahead lest he collide with the numerous great pillars or stumble into the abominable pit he had uncovered.      Once his shaking fingers touched something which he knew must be the steps leading to the hellish altar, and from this spot he recoiled in loathing. At another time he encountered the pierced slab he had removed, and here his caution became almost pitiful. But he did not come upon the dread aperture after all, nor did anything issue from that aperture to detain him. What had been down there made no sound nor stir. Evidently its crunching of the fallen electric torch had not been good for it. Each time Willetts fingers felt a perforated slab he trembled. His passage over it would sometimes increase the groaning below, but generally it would produce no effect at all, since he moved very noiselessly. Several times during his progress the glow ahead diminished perceptibly, and he realised that the various candles and lamps he had left must be expiring one by one. The thought of being lost in utter darkness without matches amidst this underground world of nightmare labyrinths impelled him to rise to his feet and run, which he could safely do now that he had passed the open pit; for he knew that once the light failed, his only hope of rescue and survival would lie in whatever relief party Mr. Ward might send after missing him for a sufficient period. Presently, however, he emerged from the open space into the narrower corridor and definitely located the glow as coming from a door on his right. In a moment he had reached it and was standing once more in young Wards secret library, trembling with relief, and watching the sputterings of that last lamp which had brought him to safety.4.      In another moment he was hastily filling the burned-out lamps from an oil supply he had previously noticed, and when the room was bright again he looked about to see if he might find a lantern for further exploration. For racked though he was with horror, his sense of grim purpose was still uppermost; and he was firmly determined to leave no stone unturned in his search for the hideous facts behind Charles Wards bizarre madness. Failing to find a lantern, he chose the smallest of the lamps to carry; also filling his pockets with candles and matches, and taking with him a gallon can of oil, which he proposed to keep for reserve use in whatever hidden laboratory he might uncover beyond the terrible open space with its unclean altar and nameless covered wells. To traverse that space again would require his utmost fortitude, but he knew it must be done. Fortunately neither the frightful altar nor the opened shaft was near the vast cell-indented wall which bounded the cavern area, and whose black mysterious archways would form the next goals of a logical search.      So Willett went back to that great pillared hall of stench and anguished howling; turning down his lamp to avoid any distant glimpse of the hellish altar, or of the uncovered pit with the pierced stone slab beside it. Most of the black doorways led merely to small chambers, some vacant and some evidently used as storerooms; and in several of the latter he saw some very curious accumulations of various objects. One was packed with rotting and dust-draped bales of spare clothing, and the explorer thrilled when he saw that it was unmistakably the clothing of a century and a half before. In another room he found numerous odds and ends of modern clothing, as if gradual provisions were being made to equip a large body of men. But what he disliked most of all were the huge copper vats which occasionally appeared; these, and the sinister incrustations upon them. He liked them even less than the weirdly figured leaden bowls whose rims retained such obnoxious deposits and around which clung repellent odours perceptible above even the general noisomeness of the crypt. When he had completed about half the entire circuit of the wall he found another corridor like that from which he had come, and out of which many doors opened. This he proceeded to investigate; and after entering three rooms of medium size and of no significant contents, he came at last to a large oblong apartment whose business-like tanks and tables, furnaces and modern instruments, occasional books and endless shelves of jars and bottles proclaimed it indeed the long-sought laboratory of Charles Ward - and no doubt of old Joseph Curwen before him.      After lighting the three lamps which he found filled and ready, Dr. Willett examined the place and all its appurtenances with the keenest interest; noting from the relative quantities of various reagents on the shelves that young Wards dominant concern must have been with some branch of organic chemistry. On the whole, little could be learned from the scientific ensemble, which included a gruesome-looking dissecting table; so that the room was really rather a disappointment. Among the books was a tattered old copy of Borellus in black-letter, and it was weirdly interesting to note that Ward had underlined the same passage whose marking had so perturbed good Mr. Merritt at Curwens farmhouse more than a century and a half before. That older copy, of course, must have perished along with the rest of Curwens occult library in the final raid. Three archways opened off the laboratory, and these the doctor proceeded to sample in turn. From his cursory survey he saw that two led merely to small storerooms; but these he canvassed with care, remarking the piles of coffins in various stages of damage and shuddering violently at two or three of the few coffin-plates he could decipher. There was much clothing also stored in these rooms, and several new and tightly nailed boxes which he did not stop to investigate. Most interesting of all, perhaps, were some odd bits which he judged to be fragments of old Joseph Curwens laboratory appliances. These had suffered damage at the hands of the raiders, but were still partly recognisable as the chemical paraphernalia of the Georgian period.      The third archway led to a very sizeable chamber entirely lined with shelves and having in the centre a table bearing two lamps. These lamps Willett lighted, and in their brilliant glow studied the endless shelving which surrounded him. Some of the upper levels were wholly vacant, but most of the space was filled with small odd-looking leaden jars of two general types; one tall and without handles like a Grecian lekythos or oil-jug, and the other with a single handle and proportioned like a Phaleron jug. All had metal stoppers, and were covered with peculiar-looking symbols moulded in low relief. In a moment the doctor noticed that these jugs were classified with great rigidity; all the lekythoi being on one side of the room with a large wooden sign reading \"Custodes\" above them, and all the Phalerons on the other, correspondingly labelled with a sign reading \"Materia\". Each of the jars or jugs, except some on the upper shelves that turned out to be vacant, bore a cardboard tag with a number apparently referring to a catalogue; and Willett resolved to look for the latter presently. For the moment, however, he was more interested in the nature of the array as a whole; and experimentally opened several of the lekythoi and Phalerons at random with a view to a rough generalisation. The result was invariable. Both types of jar contained a small quantity of a single kind of substance; a fine dusty powder of very light weight and of many shades of dull, neutral colour. To the colours which formed the only point of variation there was no apparent method of disposal; and no distinction between what occurred in the lekythoi and what occurred in the Phalerons. A bluish-grey powder might be by the side of a pinkish-white one, and any one in a Phaleron might have its exact counterpart in a lekythos. The most individual feature about the powders was their non-adhesiveness. Willett would pour one into his hand, and upon returning it to its jug would find that no residue whatever remained on its palm.      The meaning of the two signs puzzled him, and he wondered why this battery of chemicals was separated so radically from those in glass jars on the shelves of the laboratory proper. \"Custodes\", \"Materia\"; that was the Latin for \"Guards\" and \"Materials\", respectively - and then there came a flash of memory as to where he had seen that word \"Guards\" before in connexion with this dreadful mystery. It was, of course, in the recent letter to Dr. Allen purporting to be from old Edward Hutchinson; and the phrase had read: \"There was no Neede to keep the Guards in Shape and eatg off their Heads, and it made Much to be founde in Case of Trouble, as you too welle knowe.\" What did this signify? But wait - was there not still another reference to \"guards\" in this matter which he had failed wholly to recall when reading the Hutchinson letter? Back in the old non-secretive days Ward had told him of the Eleazar Smith diary recording the spying of Smith and Weeden on the Curwen farm, and in that dreadful chronicle there had been a mention of conversations overheard before the old wizard betook himself wholly beneath the earth. There had been, Smith and Weeden insisted, terrible colloquies wherein figured Curwen, certain captives of his, and the guards of those captives. Those guards, according to Hutchinson or his avatar, had eaten their heads off, so that now Dr. Allen did not keep them in shape. And if not in shape, how save as the \"salts\" to which it appears this wizard band was engaged in reducing as many human bodies or skeletons as they could?      So that was what these lekythoi contained; the monstrous fruit of unhallowed rites and deeds, presumably won or cowed to such submission as to help, when called up by some hellish incantation, in the defence of their blasphemous master or the questioning of those who were not so willing? Willett shuddered at the thought of what he had been pouring in and out of his hands, and for a moment felt an impulse to flee in panic from that cavern of hideous shelves with their silent and perhaps watching sentinels. Then he thought of the \"Materia\" - in the myriad Phaleron jugs on the other side of the room. Salts too - and if not the salts of \"guards\", then the salts of what? God! Could it be possible that here lay the mortal relics of half the titan thinkers of all the ages; snatched by supreme ghouls from crypts where the world thought them safe, and subject to the beck and call of madmen who sought to drain their knowledge for some still wilder end whose ultimate effect would concern, as poor Charles had hinted in his frantic note, all civilisation, all natural law, perhaps even the fate of the solar system and the universe? And Marinus Bicknell Willett had sifted their dust through his hands!      Then he noticed a small door at the farther end of the room, and calmed himself enough to approach it and examine the crude sign chiselled above. It was only a symbol, but it filled him with vague spiritual dread; for a morbid, dreaming friend of his had once drawn it on paper and told him a few of the things it means in the dark abyss of sleep. It was the sign of Koth, that dreamers see fixed above the archway of a certain black tower standing alone in twilight - and Willett did not like what his friend Randolph Carter had said of its powers. But a moment later he forgot the sign as he recognised a new acrid odour in the stench-filled air. This was a chemical rather than animal smell, and came clearly from the room beyond the door. And it was, unmistakably, the same odour which had saturated Charles Wards clothing on the day the doctors had taken him away. So it was here that the youth had been interrupted by the final summons? He was wiser than old Joseph Curwen, for he had not resisted. Willett, boldly determined to penetrate every wonder and nightmare this nether realm might contain, seized the small lamp and crossed the threshold. A wave of nameless fright rolled out to meet him, but he yielded to no whim and deferred to no intuition. There was nothing alive here to harm him, and he would not be stayed in his piercing of the eldritch cloud which engulfed his patient.      The room beyond the door was of medium size, and had no furniture save a table, a single chair, and two groups of curious machines with clamps and wheels, which Willett recognised after a moment as mediaeval instruments of torture. On one side of the door stood a rack of savage whips, above which were some shelves bearing empty rows of shallow pedestalled cups of lead shaped like Grecian kylikes. On the other side was the table; with a powerful Argand lamp, a pad and pencil, and two of the stoppered lekythoi from the shelves outside set down at irregular places as if temporarily or in haste. Willett lighted the lamp and looked carefully at the pad, to see what notes young Ward might have been jotting down when interrupted; but found nothing more intelligible than the following disjointed fragments in that crabbed Curwen chirography, which shed no light on the case as a whole:\"B. dyd not. Escapd into walls and founde Place below.\"Saw olde V. saye ye Sabaoth and learnt ye Way.\"Raisd Yog-Sothoth thrice and was ye nexte Day deliverd.\"F. soughte to wipe out all knowg howe to raise Those from Outside.\"      As the strong Argand blaze lit up the entire chamber the doctor saw that the wall opposite the door, between the two groups of torturing appliances in the corners, was covered with pegs from which hung a set of shapeless-looking robes of a rather dismal yellowish-white. But far more interesting were the two vacant walls, both of which were thickly covered with mystic symbols and formulae roughly chiselled in the smooth dressed stone. The damp floor also bore marks of carving; and with but little difficulty Willett deciphered a huge pentagram in the centre, with a plain circle about three feet wide half way between this and each corner. In one of these four circles, near where a yellowish robe had been flung carelessly down, there stood a shallow kylix of the sort found on the shelves above the whip-rack; and just outside the periphery was one of the Phaleron jugs from the shelves in the other room, its tag numbered 118. This was unstoppered, and proved upon inspection to be empty; but the explorer saw with a shiver that the kylix was not. Within its shallow area, and saved from scattering only by the absence of wind in this sequestered cavern, lay a small amount of a dry, dull-greenish efflorescent powder which must have belonged in the jug; and Willett almost reeled at the implications that came sweeping over him as he correlated little by little the several elements and antecedents of the scene. The whips and the instruments of torture, the dust or salts from the jug of \"Materia\", the two lekythoi from the \"Custodes\" shelf, the robes, the formulae on the walls, the notes on the pad, the hints from letters and legends, and the thousand glimpses, doubts, and suppositions which had come to torment the friends and parents of Charles Ward - all these engulfed the doctor in a tidal wave of horror as he looked at that dry greenish powder outspread in the pedestalled leaden kylix on the floor.      With an effort, however, Willett pulled himself together and began studying the formulae chiselled on the walls. From the stained and incrusted letters it was obvious that they were carved in Joseph Curwens time, and their text was such as to be vaguely familiar to one who had read much Curwen material or delved extensively into the history of magic. One the doctor clearly recognised as what Mrs. Ward heard her son chanting on that ominous Good Friday a year before, and what an authority had told him was a very terrible invocation addressed to secret gods outside the normal spheres. It was not spelled here exactly as Mrs. Ward had set it down from memory, nor yet as the authority had shewn it to him in the forbidden pages of \"Eliphas Levi\"; but its identity was unmistakable, and such words as Sabaoth, Metraton, Almousin, and Zariatnatmik sent a shudder of fright through the searcher who had seen and felt so much of cosmic abomination just around the corner.      This was on the left-hand wall as one entered the room. The right-hand wall was no less thickly inscribed, and Willett felt a start of recognition as he came upon the pair of formulae so frequently occurring in the recent notes in the library. They were, roughly speaking, the same; with the ancient symbols of \"Dragons Head\" and \"Dragons Tail\" heading them as in Wards scribblings. But the spelling differed quite widely from that of the modern versions, as if old Curwen had had a different way of recording sound, or as if later study had evolved more powerful and perfected variants of the invocations in question. The doctor tried to reconcile the chiselled version with the one which still ran persistently in his head, and found it hard to do. Where the script he had memorised began \"Yai ngngah, Yog-Sothoth\", this epigraph started out as \"Aye, engengah, Yogge-Sothotha\"; which to his mind would seriously interfere with the syllabification of the second word.      Ground as the later text was into his consciousness, the discrepancy disturbed him; and he found himself chanting the first of the formulae aloud in an effort to square the sound he conceived with the letters he found carved. Weird and menacing in that abyss of antique blasphemy rang his voice; its accents keyed to a droning sing-song either through the spell of the past and the unknown, or through the hellish example of that dull, godless wail from the pits whose inhuman cadences rose and fell rhythmically in the distance through the stench and the darkness.\"YAI NGNGAH,YOG-SOTHOTHHEE - LGEBFAI THRODOGUAAAH!\"      But what was this cold wind which had sprung into life at the very outset of the chant? The lamps were sputtering woefully, and the gloom grew so dense that the letters on the wall nearly faded from sight. There was smoke, too, and an acrid odour which quite drowned out the stench from the far-away wells; an odour like that he had smelt before, yet infinitely stronger and more pungent. He turned from the inscriptions to face the room with its bizarre contents, and saw that the kylix on the floor, in which the ominous efflorescent powder had lain, was giving forth a cloud of thick, greenish-black vapour of surprising volume and opacity. That powder - Great God! it had come from the shelf of \"Materia\" - what was it doing now, and what had started it? The formula he had been chanting - the first of the pair - Dragons Head, ascending node - Blessed Saviour, could it be. . . .      The doctor reeled, and through his head raced wildly disjointed scraps from all he had seen, heard, and read of the frightful case of Joseph Curwen and Charles Dexter Ward. \"I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe. . . . Have ye Wordes for laying at all times readie, and stopp not to be sure when there is any Doubte of Whom you have. . . . Three Talkes with What was therein inhumd. . . .\" Mercy of Heaven, what is that shape behind the parting smoke?5.      Marinus Bicknell Willett has no hope that any part of his tale will be believed except by certain sympathetic friends, hence he has made no attempt to tell it beyond his most intimate circle. Only a few outsiders have ever heard it repeated, and of these the majority laugh and remark that the doctor surely is getting old. He has been advised to take a long vacation and to shun future cases dealing with mental disturbance. But Mr. Ward knows that the veteran physician speaks only a horrible truth. Did not he himself see the noisome aperture in the bungalow cellar? Did not Willett send him home overcome and ill at eleven oclock that portentous morning? Did he not telephone the doctor in vain that evening, and again the next day, and had he not driven to the bungalow itself on that following noon, finding his friend unconscious but unharmed on one of the beds upstairs? Willett had been breathing stertorously, and opened his eyes slowly when Mr. Ward gave him some brandy fetched from the car. Then he shuddered and screamed, crying out, \"That beard . . . those eyes. . . . God, who are you?\" A very strange thing to say to a trim, blue-eyed, clean-shaven gentleman whom he had known from the latters boyhood.      In the bright noon sunlight the bungalow was unchanged since the previous morning. Willetts clothing bore no disarrangement beyond certain smudges and worn places at the knees, and only a faint acrid odour reminded Mr. Ward of what he had smelt on his son that day he was taken to the hospital. The doctors flashlight was missing, but his valise was safely there, as empty as when he had brought it. Before indulging in any explanations, and obviously with great moral effort, Willett staggered dizzily down to the cellar and tried the fateful platform before the tubs. It was unyielding. Crossing to where he had left his yet unused tool satchel the day before, he obtained a chisel and began to pry up the stubborn planks one by one. Underneath the smooth concrete was still visible, but of any opening or perforation there was no longer a trace. Nothing yawned this time to sicken the mystified father who had followed the doctor downstairs; only the smooth concrete underneath the planks - no noisome well, no world of subterrene horrors, no secret library, no Curwen papers, no nightmare pits of stench and howling, no laboratory or shelves or chiselled formulae, no. . . . Dr. Willett turned pale, and clutched at the younger man. \"Yesterday,\" he asked softly, \"did you see it here . . . and smell it?\" And when Mr. Ward, himself transfixed with dread and wonder, found strength to nod an affirmative, the physician gave a sound half a sigh and half a gasp, and nodded in turn. \"Then I will tell you,\" he said.      So for an hour, in the sunniest room they could find upstairs, the physician whispered his frightful tale to the wondering father. There was nothing to relate beyond the looming up of that form when the greenish-black vapour from the kylix parted, and Willett was too tired to ask himself what had really occurred. There were futile, bewildered head-shakings from both men, and once Mr. Ward ventured a hushed suggestion, \"Do you suppose it would be of any use to dig?\" The doctor was silent, for it seemed hardly fitting for any human brain to answer when powers of unknown spheres had so vitally encroached on this side of the Great Abyss. Again Mr. Ward asked, \"But where did it go? It brought you here, you know, and it sealed up the hole somehow.\" And Willett again let silence answer for him.      But after all, this was not the final phase of the matter. Reaching for his handkerchief before rising to leave, Dr. Willetts fingers closed upon a piece of paper in his pocket which had not been there before, and which was companioned by the candles and matches he had seized in the vanished vault. It was a common sheet, torn obviously from the cheap pad in that fabulous room of horror somewhere underground, and the writing upon it was that of an ordinary lead pencil - doubtless the one which had lain beside the pad. It was folded very carelessly, and beyond the faint acrid scent of the cryptic chamber bore no print or mark of any world but this. But in the text itself it did indeed reek with wonder; for here was no script of any wholesome age, but the laboured strokes of mediaeval darkness, scarcely legible to the laymen who now strained over it, yet having combinations of symbols which seemed vaguely familiar. The briefly scrawled message was this, and its mystery lent purpose to the shaken pair, who forthwith walked steadily out to the Ward car and gave orders to be driven first to a quiet dining place and then to the John Hay Library on the hill.      At the library it was easy to find good manuals of palaeography, and over these the two men puzzled till the lights of evening shone out from the great chandelier. In the end they found what was needed. The letters were indeed no fantastic invention, but the normal script of a very dark period. They were the pointed Saxon minuscules of the eighth or ninth century A.D., and brought with them memories of an uncouth time when under a fresh Christian veneer ancient faiths and ancient rites stirred stealthily, and the pale moon of Britain looked sometimes on strange deeds in the Roman ruins of Caerleon and Hexham, and by the towers along Hadrians crumbling wall. The words were in such Latin as a barbarous age might remember - \"Corvinus necandus est. Cadaver aq(ua) forti dissolvendum, nec aliq(ui)d retinendum. Tace ut potes.\" - which may roughly be translated, \"Curwen must be killed. The body must be dissolved in aqua fortis, nor must anything be retained. Keep silence as best you are able.\"      Willett and Mr. Ward were mute and baffled. They had met the unknown, and found that they lacked emotions to respond to it as they vaguely believed they ought. With Willett, especially, the capacity for receiving fresh impressions of awe was well-nigh exhausted; and both men sat still and helpless till the closing of the library forced them to leave. Then they drove listlessly to the Ward mansion in Prospect Street, and talked to no purpose into the night. The doctor rested toward morning, but did not go home. And he was still there Sunday noon when a telephone message came from the detectives who had been assigned to look up Dr. Allen.      Mr. Ward, who was pacing nervously about in a dressing-gown, answered the call in person; and told the men to come up early the next day when he heard their report was almost ready. Both Willett and he were glad that this phase of the matter was taking form, for whatever the origin of the strange minuscule message, it seemed certain that the \"Curwen\" who must be destroyed could be no other than the bearded and spectacled stranger. Charles had feared this man, and had said in the frantic note that he must be killed and dissolved in acid. Allen, moreover, had been receiving letters from the strange wizards in Europe under the name of Curwen, and palpably regarded himself as an avatar of the bygone necromancer. And now from a fresh and unknown source had come a message saying that \"Curwen\" must be killed and dissolved in acid. The linkage was too unmistakable to be factitious; and besides, was not Allen planning to murder young Ward upon the advice of the creature called Hutchinson? Of course, the letter they had seen had never reached the bearded stranger; but from its text they could see that Allen had already formed plans for dealing with the youth if he grew too squeamish. Without doubt, Allen must be apprehended; and even if the most drastic directions were not carried out, he must be placed where he could inflict no harm upon Charles Ward.      That afternoon, hoping against hope to extract some gleam of information anent the inmost mysteries from the only available one capable of giving it, the father and the doctor went down the bay and called on young Charles at the hospital. Simply and gravely Willett told him all he had found, and noticed how pale he turned as each description made certain the truth of the discovery. The physician employed as much dramatic effect as he could, and watched for a wincing on Charless part when he approached the matter of the covered pits and the nameless hybrids within. But Ward did not wince. Willett paused, and his voice grew indignant as he spoke of how the things were starving. He taxed the youth with shocking inhumanity, and shivered when only a sardonic laugh came in reply. For Charles, having dropped as useless his pretence that the crypt did not exist, seemed to see some ghastly jest in this affair; and chuckled hoarsely at something which amused him. Then he whispered, in accents doubly terrible because of the cracked voice he used, \"Damn em, they do eat, but they dont need to! Thats the rare part! A month, you say, without food? Lud, Sir, you be modest! Dye know, that was the joke on poor old Whipple with his virtuous bluster! Kill everything off, would he? Why, damme, he was half-deaf with the noise from Outside and never saw or heard aught from the wells! He never dreamed they were there at all! Devil take ye, those cursed things have been howling down there ever since Curwen was done for a hundred and fifty-seven years gone!\"      But no more than this could Willett get from the youth. Horrified, yet almost convinced against his will, he went on with his tale in the hope that some incident might startle his auditor out of the mad composure he maintained. Looking at the youths face, the doctor could not but feel a kind of terror at the changes which recent months had wrought. Truly, the boy had drawn down nameless horrors from the skies. When the room with the formulae and the greenish dust was mentioned, Charles shewed his first sign of animation. A quizzical look overspread his face as he heard what Willett had read on the pad, and he ventured the mild statement that those notes were old ones, of no possible significance to anyone not deeply initiated in the history of magic. \"But,\" he added, \"had you but known the words to bring up that which I had out in the cup, you had not been here to tell me this. Twas Number 118, and I conceive you would have shook had you looked it up in my list in tother room. Twas never raised by me, but I meant to have it up that day you came to invite me hither.\"      Then Willett told of the formula he had spoken and of the greenish-black smoke which had arisen; and as he did so he saw true fear dawn for the first time on Charles Wards face. \"It came, and you be here alive?\" As Ward croaked the words his voice seemed almost to burst free of its trammels and sink to cavernous abysses of uncanny resonance. Willett, gifted with a flash of inspiration, believed he saw the situation, and wove into his reply a caution from a letter he remembered. \"No. 118, you say? But dont forget that stones are all changed now in nine grounds out of ten. You are never sure till you question!\" And then, without warning, he drew forth the minuscule message and flashed it before the patients eyes. He could have wished no stronger result, for Charles Ward fainted forthwith.      All this conversation, of course, had been conducted with the greatest secrecy lest the resident alienists accuse the father and the physician of encouraging a madman in his delusions. Unaided, too, Dr. Willett and Mr. Ward picked up the stricken youth and placed him on the couch. In reviving, the patient mumbled many times of some word which he must get to Orne and Hutchinson at once; so when his consciousness seemed fully back the doctor told him that of those strange creatures at least one was his bitter enemy, and had given Dr. Allen advice for his assassination. This revelation produced no visible effect, and before it was made the visitors could see that their host had already the look of a hunted man. After that he would converse no more, so Willett and the father departed presently; leaving behind a caution against the bearded Allen, to which the youth only replied that this individual was very safely taken care of, and could do no one any harm even if he wished. This was said with an almost evil chuckle very painful to hear. They did not worry about any communications Charles might indite to that monstrous pair in Europe, since they knew that the hospital authorities seized all outgoing mail for censorship and would pass no wild or outr-looking missive.      There is, however, a curious sequel to the matter of Orne and Hutchinson, if such indeed the exiled wizards were. Moved by some vague presentiment amidst the horrors of that period, Willett arranged with an international press-cutting bureau for accounts of notable current crimes and accidents in Prague and in eastern Transylvania; and after six months believed that he had found two very significant things amongst the multifarious items he received and had translated. One was the total wrecking of a house by night in the oldest quarter of Prague, and the disappearance of the evil old man called Josef Nadek, who had dwelt in it alone ever since anyone could remember. The other was a titan explosion in the Transylvanian mountains east of Rakus, and the utter extirpation with all its inmates of the ill-regarded Castle Ferenczy, whose master was so badly spoken of by peasants and soldiery alike that he would shortly have been summoned to Bucharest for serious questioning had not this incident cut off a career already so long as to antedate all common memory. Willett maintains that the hand which wrote those minuscules was able to wield stronger weapons as well; and that while Curwen was left to him to dispose of, the writer felt able to find and deal with Orne and Hutchinson itself. Of what their fate may have been the doctor strives sedulously not to think.6.      The following morning Dr. Willett hastened to the Ward home to be present when the detectives arrived. Allens destruction or imprisonment - or Curwens, if one might regard the tacit claim to reincarnation as valid - he felt must be accomplished at any cost, and he communicated this conviction to Mr. Ward as they sat waiting for the men to come. They were downstairs this time, for the upper parts of the house were beginning to be shunned because of a peculiar nauseousness which hung indefinitely about; a nauseousness which the older servants connected with some curse left by the vanished Curwen portrait.      At nine oclock the three detectives presented themselves and immediately delivered all that they had to say. They had not, regrettably enough, located the Brava Tony Gomes as they had wished, nor had they found the least trace of Dr. Allens source or present whereabouts; but they had managed to unearth a considerable number of local impressions and facts concerning the reticent stranger. Allen had struck Pawtuxet people as a vaguely unnatural being, and there was an universal belief that his thick sandy beard was either dyed or false - a belief conclusively upheld by the finding of such a false beard, together with a pair of dark glasses, in his room at the fateful bungalow. His voice, Mr. Ward could well testify from his one telephone conversation, had a depth and hollowness that could not be forgotten; and his glance seemed malign even through his smoked and horn-rimmed glasses. One shopkeeper, in the course of negotiations, had seen a specimen of his handwriting and declared it was very queer and crabbed; this being confirmed by pencilled notes of no clear meaning found in his room and identified by the merchant. In connexion with the vampirism rumours of the preceding summer, a majority of the gossips believed that Allen rather than Ward was the actual vampire. Statements were also obtained from the officials who had visited the bungalow after the unpleasant incident of the motor truck robbery. They had felt less of the sinister in Dr. Allen, but had recognised him as the dominant figure in the queer shadowy cottage. The place had been too dark for them to observe him clearly, but they would know him again if they saw him. His beard had looked odd, and they thought he had some slight scar above his dark spectacled right eye. As for the detectives search of Allens room, it yielded nothing definite save the beard and glasses, and several pencilled notes in a crabbed writing which Willett at once saw was identical with that shared by the old Curwen manuscripts and by the voluminous recent notes of young Ward found in the vanished catacombs of horror.      Dr. Willett and Mr. Ward caught something of a profound, subtle, and insidious cosmic fear from this data as it was gradually unfolded, and almost trembled in following up the vague, mad thought which had simultaneously reached their minds. The false beard and glasses - the crabbed Curwen penmanship - the old portrait and its tiny scar - and the altered youth in the hospital with such a scar - that deep, hollow voice on the telephone - was it not of this that Mr. Ward was reminded when his son barked forth those pitiable tones to which he now claimed to be reduced? Who had ever seen Charles and Allen together? Yes, the officials had once, but who later on? Was it not when Allen left that Charles suddenly lost his growing fright and began to live wholly at the bungalow? Curwen - Allen - Ward - in what blasphemous and abominable fusion had two ages and two persons become involved? That damnable resemblance of the picture to Charles - had it not used to stare and stare, and follow the boy around the room with its eyes? Why, too, did both Allen and Charles copy Joseph Curwens handwriting, even when alone and off guard? And then the frightful work of those people - the lost crypt of horrors that had aged the doctor overnight; the starved monsters in the noisome pits; the awful formula which had yielded such nameless results; the message in minuscules found in Willetts pocket; the papers and the letters and all the talk of graves and \"salts\" and discoveries - whither did everything lead? In the end Mr. Ward did the most sensible thing. Steeling himself against any realisation of why he did it, he gave the detectives an article to be shewn to such Pawtuxet shopkeepers as had seen the portentous Dr. Allen. That article was a photograph of his luckless son, on which he now carefully drew in ink the pair of heavy glasses and the black pointed beard which the men had brought from Allens room.      For two hours he waited with the doctor in the oppressive house where fear and miasma were slowly gathering as the empty panel in the upstairs library leered and leered and leered. Then the men returned. Yes. The altered photograph was a very passable likeness of Dr. Allen. Mr. Ward turned pale, and Willett wiped a suddenly dampened brow with his handkerchief. Allen - Ward - Curwen - it was becoming too hideous for coherent thought. What had the boy called out of the void, and what had it done to him? What, really, had happened from first to last? Who was this Allen who sought to kill Charles as too squeamish, and why had his destined victim said in the postscript to that frantic letter that he must be so completely obliterated in acid? Why, too, had the minuscule message, of whose origin no one dared think, said that \"Curwen\" must be likewise obliterated? What was the change, and when had the final stage occurred? That day when his frantic note was received - he had been nervous all the morning, then there was an alteration. He had slipped out unseen and swaggered boldly in past the men hired to guard him. That was the time, when he was out. But no - had he not cried out in terror as he entered his study - this very room? What had he found there? Or wait - what had found him? That simulacrum which brushed boldly in without having been seen to go - was that an alien shadow and a horror forcing itself upon a trembling figure which had never gone out at all? Had not the butler spoken of queer noises?      Willett rang for the man and asked him some low-toned questions. It had, surely enough, been a bad business. There had been noises - a cry, a gasp, a choking, and a sort of clattering or creaking or thumping, or all of these. And Mr. Charles was not the same when he stalked out without a word. The butler shivered as he spoke, and sniffed at the heavy air that blew down from some open window upstairs. Terror had settled definitely upon the house, and only the business-like detectives failed to imbibe a full measure of it. Even they were restless, for this case had held vague elements in the background which pleased them not at all. Dr. Willett was thinking deeply and rapidly, and his thoughts were terrible ones. Now and then he would almost break into muttering as he ran over in his head a new, appalling, and increasingly conclusive chain of nightmare happenings.      Then Mr. Ward made a sign that the conference was over, and everyone save him and the doctor left the room. It was noon now, but shadows as of coming night seemed to engulf the phantom-haunted mansion. Willett began talking very seriously to his host, and urged that he leave a great deal of the future investigation to him. There would be, he predicted, certain obnoxious elements which a friend could bear better than a relative. As family physician he must have a free hand, and the first thing he required was a period alone and undisturbed in the abandoned library upstairs, where the ancient overmantel had gathered about itself an aura of noisome horror more intense than when Joseph Curwens features themselves glanced slyly down from the painted panel.      Mr. Ward, dazed by the flood of grotesque morbidities and unthinkably maddening suggestions that poured in upon him from every side, could only acquiesce; and half an hour later the doctor was locked in the shunned room with the panelling from Olney Court. The father, listening outside, heard fumbling sounds of moving and rummaging as the moments passed; and finally a wrench and a creak, as if a tight cupboard door were being opened. Then there was a muffled cry, a kind of snorting choke, and a hasty slamming of whatever had been opened. Almost at once the key rattled and Willett appeared in the hall, haggard and ghastly, and demanding wood for the real fireplace on the south wall of the room. The furnace was not enough, he said; and the electric log had little practical use. Longing yet not daring to ask questions, Mr. Ward gave the requisite orders and a man brought some stout pine logs, shuddering as he entered the tainted air of the library to place them in the grate. Willett meanwhile had gone up to the dismantled laboratory and brought down a few odds and ends not included in the moving of the July before. They were in a covered basket, and Mr. Ward never saw what they were.      Then the doctor locked himself in the library once more, and by the clouds of smoke which rolled down past the windows from the chimney it was known that he had lighted the fire. Later, after a great rustling of newspapers, that odd wrench and creaking were heard again; followed by a thumping which none of the eavesdroppers liked. Thereafter two suppressed cries of Willetts were heard, and hard upon these came a swishing rustle of indefinable hatefulness. Finally the smoke that the wind beat down from the chimney grew very dark and acrid, and everyone wished that the weather had spared them this choking and venomous inundation of peculiar fumes. Mr. Wards head reeled, and the servants all clustered together in a knot to watch the horrible black smoke swoop down. After an age of waiting the vapours seemed to lighten, and half-formless sounds of scraping, sweeping, and other minor operations were heard behind the bolted door. And at last, after the slamming of some cupboard within, Willett made his appearance - sad, pale, and haggard, and bearing the cloth-draped basket he had taken from the upstairs laboratory. He had left the window open, and into that once accursed room was pouring a wealth of pure, wholesome air to mix with a queer new smell of disinfectants. The ancient overmantel still lingered; but it seemed robbed of malignity now, and rose as calm and stately in its white panelling as if it had never borne the picture of Joseph Curwen. Night was coming on, yet this time its shadows held no latent fright, but only a gentle melancholy. Of what he had done the doctor would never speak. To Mr. Ward he said, \"I can answer no questions, but I will say that there are different kinds of magic. I have made a great purgation, and those in this house will sleep the better for it.\"7.      That Dr. Willetts \"purgation\" had been an ordeal almost as nerve-racking in its way as his hideous wandering in the vanished crypt is shewn by the fact that the elderly physician gave out completely as soon as he reached home that evening. For three days he rested constantly in his room, though servants later muttered something about having heard him after midnight on Wednesday, when the outer door softly opened and closed with phenomenal softness. Servants imaginations, fortunately, are limited, else comment might have been excited by an item in Thursdays Evening Bulletin which ran as follows:North End GhoulsActive AgainAfter a lull of ten months since the dastardly vandalism in the Weeden lot at the North Burial Ground, a nocturnal prowler was glimpsed early this morning in the same cemetery by Robert Hart, the night watchman. Happening to glance for a moment from his shelter at about 2 a.m., Hart observed the glow of a lantern or pocket torch not far to the northwest, and upon opening the door detected the figure of a man with a trowel very plainly silhouetted against a nearby electric light. At once starting in pursuit, he saw the figure dart hurriedly toward the main entrance, gaining the street and losing himself among the shadows before approach or capture was possible.      Like the first of the ghouls active during the past year, this intruder had done no real damage before detection. A vacant part of the Ward lot shewed signs of a little superficial digging, but nothing even nearly the size of a grave had been attempted, and no previous grave had been disturbed.      Hart, who cannot describe the prowler except as a small man probably having a full beard, inclines to the view that all three of the digging incidents have a common source; but police from the Second Station think otherwise on account of the savage nature of the second incident, where an ancient coffin was removed and its headstone violently shattered.      The first of the incidents, in which it is thought an attempt to bury something was frustrated, occurred a year ago last March, and has been attributed to bootleggers seeking a cache. It is possible, says Sergt. Riley, that this third affair is of similar nature. Officers at the Second Station are taking especial pains to capture the gang of miscreants responsible for these repeated outrages.      All day Thursday Dr. Willett rested as if recuperating from something past or nerving himself for something to come. In the evening he wrote a note to Mr. Ward, which was delivered the next morning and which caused the half-dazed parent to ponder long and deeply. Mr. Ward had not been able to go down to business since the shock of Monday with its baffling reports and its sinister \"purgation\", but he found something calming about the doctors letter in spite of the despair it seemed to promise and the fresh mysteries it seemed to evoke.\"10 Barnes St.,            Providence, R.I.,      April 12, 1928.\"Dear Theodore: - I feel that I must say a word to you before doing what I am going to do tomorrow. It will conclude the terrible business we have been going through (for I feel that no spade is ever likely to reach that monstrous place we know of), but Im afraid it wont set your mind at rest unless I expressly assure you how very conclusive it is.      \"You have known me ever since you were a small boy, so I think you will not distrust me when I hint that some matters are best left undecided and unexplored. It is better that you attempt no further speculation as to Charless case, and almost imperative that you tell his mother nothing more than she already suspects. When I call on you tomorrow Charles will have escaped. That is all which need remain in anyones mind. He was mad, and he escaped. You can tell his mother gently and gradually about the mad part when you stop sending the typed notes in his name. Id advise you to join her in Atlantic City and take a rest yourself. God knows you need one after this shock, as I do myself. I am going South for a while to calm down and brace up.      \"So dont ask me any questions when I call. It may be that something will go wrong, but Ill tell you if it does. I dont think it will. There will be nothing more to worry about, for Charles will be very, very safe. He is now - safer than you dream. You need hold no fears about Allen, and who or what he is. He forms as much a part of the past as Joseph Curwens picture, and when I ring your doorbell you may feel certain that there is no such person. And what wrote that minuscule message will never trouble you or yours.      \"But you must steel yourself to melancholy, and prepare your wife to do the same. I must tell you frankly that Charless escape will not mean his restoration to you. He has been afflicted with a peculiar disease, as you must realise from the subtle physical as well as mental changes in him, and you must not hope to see him again. Have only this consolation - that he was never a fiend or even truly a madman, but only an eager, studious, and curious boy whose love of mystery and of the past was his undoing. He stumbled on things no mortal ought ever to know, and reached back through the years as no one ever should reach; and something came out of those years to engulf him.      \"And now comes the matter in which I must ask you to trust me most of all. For there will be, indeed, no uncertainty about Charless fate. In about a year, say, you can if you wish devise a suitable account of the end; for the boy will be no more. You can put up a stone in your lot at the North Burial Ground exactly ten feet west of your fathers and facing the same way, and that will mark the true resting-place of your son. Nor need you fear that it will mark any abnormality or changeling. The ashes in that grave will be those of your own unaltered bone and sinew - of the real Charles Dexter Ward whose mind you watched from infancy - the real Charles with the olive-mark on his hip and without the black witch-mark on his chest or the pit on his forehead. The Charles who never did actual evil, and who will have paid with his life for his squeamishness.      \"That is all. Charles will have escaped, and a year from now you can put up his stone. Do not question me tomorrow. And believe that the honour of your ancient family remains untainted now, as it has been at all times in the past.      \"With profoundest sympathy, and exhortations to fortitude, calmness, and resignation, I am everSincerely your friend,      Marinus B. Willett\"      So on the morning of Friday, April 13, 1928, Marinus Bicknell Willett visited the room of Charles Dexter Ward at Dr. Waites private hospital on Conanicut Island. The youth, though making no attempt to evade his caller, was in a sullen mood; and seemed disinclined to open the conversation which Willett obviously desired. The doctors discovery of the crypt and his monstrous experience therein had of course created a new source of embarrassment, so that both hesitated perceptibly after the interchange of a few strained formalities. Then a new element of constraint crept in, as Ward seemed to read behind the doctors mask-like face a terrible purpose which had never been there before. The patient quailed, conscious that since the last visit there had been a change whereby the solicitous family physician had given place to the ruthless and implacable avenger.      Ward actually turned pale, and the doctor was the first to speak. \"More,\" he said, \"has been found out, and I must warn you fairly that a reckoning is due.\"      \"Digging again, and coming upon more poor starving pets?\" was the ironic reply. It was evident that the youth meant to shew bravado to the last.      \"No,\" Willett slowly rejoined, \"this time I did not have to dig. We have had men looking up Dr. Allen, and they found the false beard and spectacles in the bungalow.\"      \"Excellent,\" commented the disquieted host in an effort to be wittily insulting, \"and I trust they proved more becoming than the beard and glasses you now have on!\"      \"They would become you very well,\" came the even and studied response, \"as indeed they seem to have done.\"      As Willett said this, it almost seemed as though a cloud passed over the sun; though there was no change in the shadows on the floor. Then Ward ventured:      \"And is this what asks so hotly for a reckoning? Suppose a man does find it now and then useful to be twofold?\"      \"No,\" said Willett gravely, \"again you are wrong. It is no business of mine if any man seeks duality; provided he has any right to exist at all, and provided he does not destroy what called him out of space.\"      Ward now started violently. \"Well, Sir, what have ye found, and what dye want with me?\"      The doctor let a little time elapse before replying, as if choosing his words for an effective answer.      \"I have found,\" he finally intoned, \"something in a cupboard behind an ancient overmantel where a picture once was, and I have burned it and buried the ashes where the grave of Charles Dexter Ward ought to be.\"      The madman choked and sprang from the chair in which he had been sitting:      \"Damn ye, who did ye tell - and wholl believe it was he after these full two months, with me alive? What dye mean to do?\"      Willett, though a small man, actually took on a kind of judicial majesty as he calmed the patient with a gesture.      \"I have told no one. This is no common case - it is a madness out of time and a horror from beyond the spheres which no police or lawyers or courts or alienists could ever fathom or grapple with. Thank God some chance has left inside me the spark of imagination, that I might not go astray in thinking out this thing. You cannot deceive me, Joseph Curwen, for I know that your accursed magic is true!      \"I know how you wove the spell that brooded outside the years and fastened on your double and descendant; I know how you drew him into the past and got him to raise you up from your detestable grave; I know how he kept you hidden in his laboratory while you studied modern things and roved abroad as a vampire by night, and how you later shewed yourself in beard and glasses that no one might wonder at your godless likeness to him; I know what you resolved to do when he balked at your monstrous rifling of the worlds tombs, and at what you planned afterward, and I know how you did it.      \"You left off your beard and glasses and fooled the guards around the house. They thought it was he who went in, and they thought it was he who came out when you had strangled and hidden him. But you hadnt reckoned on the different contents of two minds. You were a fool, Curwen, to fancy that a mere visual identity would be enough. Why didnt you think of the speech and the voice and the handwriting? It hasnt worked, you see, after all. You know better than I who or what wrote that message in minuscules, but I will warn you it was not written in vain. There are abominations and blasphemies which must be stamped out, and I believe that the writer of those words will attend to Orne and Hutchinson. One of those creatures wrote you once, do not call up any that you can not put down. You were undone once before, perhaps in that very way, and it may be that your own evil magic will undo you all again. Curwen, a man cant tamper with Nature beyond certain limits, and every horror you have woven will rise up to wipe you out.\"      But here the doctor was cut short by a convulsive cry from the creature before him. Hopelessly at bay, weaponless, and knowing that any show of physical violence would bring a score of attendants to the doctors rescue, Joseph Curwen had recourse to his one ancient ally, and began a series of cabbalistic motions with his forefingers as his deep, hollow voice, now unconcealed by feigned hoarseness, bellowed out the opening words of a terrible formula.      \"PER ADONAI ELOIM, ADONAI JEHOVA, ADONAI SABAOTH, METRATON. . . .\"      But Willett was too quick for him. Even as the dogs in the yard outside began to howl, and even as a chill wind sprang suddenly up from the bay, the doctor commenced the solemn and measured intonation of that which he had meant all along to recite. An eye for an eye - magic for magic - let the outcome shew how well the lesson of the abyss had been learned! So in a clear voice Marinus Bicknell Willett began the second of that pair of formulae whose first had raised the writer of those minuscules - the cryptic invocation whose heading was the Dragons Tail, sign of the descending node - \"OGTHROD AIFGEBL - EEHYOG-SOTHOTHNGAHNG AIYZHRO!\"      At the very first word from Willetts mouth the previously commenced formula of the patient stopped short. Unable to speak, the monster made wild motions with his arms until they too were arrested. When the awful name of Yog-Sothoth was uttered, the hideous change began. It was not merely a dissolution, but rather a transformation or recapitulation; and Willett shut his eyes lest he faint before the rest of the incantation could be pronounced.      But he did not faint, and that man of unholy centuries and forbidden secrets never troubled the world again. The madness out of time had subsided, and the case of Charles Dexter Ward was closed. Opening his eyes before staggering out of that room of horror, Dr. Willett saw that what he had kept in memory had not been kept amiss. There had, as he had predicted, been no need for acids. For like his accursed picture a year before, Joseph Curwen now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust.", "IV.For a decade the annals of the Whateleys sink indistinguishably into the general life of a morbid community used to their queer ways and hardened to their May-Eve and All-Hallows orgies. Twice a year they would light fires on the top of Sentinel Hill, at which times the mountain rumblings would recur with greater and greater violence; while at all seasons there were strange and portentous doings at the lonely farmhouse. In the course of time callers professed to hear sounds in the sealed upper story even when all the family were downstairs, and they wondered how swiftly or how lingeringly a cow or bullock was usually sacrificed. There was talk of a complaint to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; but nothing ever came of it, since Dunwich folk are never anxious to call the outside world’s attention to themselves.      About 1923, when Wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind, voice, stature, and bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity, a second great siege of carpentry went on at the old house. It was all inside the sealed upper part, and from bits of discarded lumber people concluded that the youth and his grandfather had knocked out all the partitions and even removed the attic floor, leaving only one vast open void between the ground story and the peaked roof. They had torn down the great central chimney, too, and fitted the rusty range with a flimsy outside tin stovepipe.      In the spring after this event Old Whateley noticed the growing number of whippoorwills that would come out of Cold Spring Glen to chirp under his window at night. He seemed to regard the circumstance as one of great significance, and told the loungers at Osborn’s that he thought his time had almost come.      “They whistle jest in tune with my breathin’ naow,” he said, “an’ I guess they’re gittin’ ready to ketch my soul. They know it’s a-goin’ aout, an’ dun’t calc’late to miss it. Yew’ll know, boys, arter I’m gone, whether they git me er not. Ef they dew, they’ll keep up a-singin’ an’ laffin’ till break o’ day. Ef they dun’t they’ll kinder quiet daown like. I expeck them an’ the souls they hunts fer hev some pretty tough tussles sometimes.”      On Lammas Night, 1924, Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury was hastily summoned by Wilbur Whateley, who had lashed his one remaining horse through the darkness and telephoned from Osborn’s in the village. He found Old Whateley in a very grave state, with a cardiac action and stertorous breathing that told of an end not far off. The shapeless albino daughter and oddly bearded grandson stood by the bedside, whilst from the vacant abyss overhead there came a disquieting suggestion of rhythmical surging or lapping, as of the waves on some level beach. The doctor, though, was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds outside; a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their endless message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps of the dying man. It was uncanny and unnatural—too much, thought Dr. Houghton, like the whole of the region he had entered so reluctantly in response to the urgent call.      Toward one o’clock Old Whateley gained consciousness, and interrupted his wheezing to choke out a few words to his grandson.      “More space, Willy, more space soon. Yew grows—an’ that grows faster. It’ll be ready to sarve ye soon, boy. Open up the gates to Yog-Sothoth with the long chant that ye’ll find on page 751 of the complete edition, an’ then put a match to the prison. Fire from airth can’t burn it nohaow.”      He was obviously quite mad. After a pause, during which the flock of whippoorwills outside adjusted their cries to the altered tempo while some indications of the strange hill noises came from afar off, he added another sentence or two.      “Feed it reg’lar, Willy, an’ mind the quantity; but dun’t let it grow too fast fer the place, fer ef it busts quarters or gits aout afore ye opens to Yog-Sothoth, it’s all over an’ no use. Only them from beyont kin make it multiply an’ work. . . . Only them, the old uns as wants to come back. . . .”      But speech gave place to gasps again, and Lavinia screamed at the way the whippoorwills followed the change. It was the same for more than an hour, when the final throaty rattle came. Dr. Houghton drew shrunken lids over the glazing grey eyes as the tumult of birds faded imperceptibly to silence. Lavinia sobbed, but Wilbur only chuckled whilst the hill noises rumbled faintly.      “They didn’t git him,” he muttered in his heavy bass voice.      Wilbur was by this time a scholar of really tremendous erudition in his one-sided way, and was quietly known by correspondence to many librarians in distant places where rare and forbidden books of old days are kept. He was more and more hated and dreaded around Dunwich because of certain youthful disappearances which suspicion laid vaguely at his door; but was always able to silence inquiry through fear or through use of that fund of old-time gold which still, as in his grandfather’s time, went forth regularly and increasingly for cattle-buying. He was now tremendously mature of aspect, and his height, having reached the normal adult limit, seemed inclined to wax beyond that figure. In 1925, when a scholarly correspondent from Miskatonic University called upon him one day and departed pale and puzzled, he was fully six and three-quarters feet tall.      Through all the years Wilbur had treated his half-deformed albino mother with a growing contempt, finally forbidding her to go to the hills with him on May-Eve and Hallowmass; and in 1926 the poor creature complained to Mamie Bishop of being afraid of him.      “They’s more abaout him as I knows than I kin tell ye, Mamie,” she said, “an’ naowadays they’s more nor what I know myself. I vaow afur Gawd, I dun’t know what he wants nor what he’s a-tryin’ to dew.”      That Hallowe’en the hill noises sounded louder than ever, and fire burned on Sentinel Hill as usual; but people paid more attention to the rhythmical screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally belated whippoorwills which seemed to be assembled near the unlighted Whateley farmhouse. After midnight their shrill notes burst into a kind of pandaemoniac cachinnation which filled all the countryside, and not until dawn did they finally quiet down. Then they vanished, hurrying southward where they were fully a month overdue. What this meant, no one could quite be certain till later. None of the country folk seemed to have died—but poor Lavinia Whateley, the twisted albino, was never seen again.      In the summer of 1927 Wilbur repaired two sheds in the farmyard and began moving his books and effects out to them. Soon afterward Earl Sawyer told the loungers at Osborn’s that more carpentry was going on in the Whateley farmhouse. Wilbur was closing all the doors and windows on the ground floor, and seemed to be taking out partitions as he and his grandfather had done upstairs four years before. He was living in one of the sheds, and Sawyer thought he seemed unusually worried and tremulous. People generally suspected him of knowing something about his mother’s disappearance, and very few ever approached his neighbourhood now. His height had increased to more than seven feet, and shewed no signs of ceasing its development."]}
{"id": "EN054", "pair": ["That is the end of the story, dear readers. Believe me or not, I dont care. I ran far away from the university that evening and, to this day, I have never returned. I had to have my arm amputated after that and my burned and mangled body remains as testament to the evil I have encountered. I told the authorities it was a college fire. What else could I say?I cannot sleep well anymore. Every night I lie awake, shaking in fear in the knowledge of what exists beyond the limited scope of what we call \"reality\". What is reality? I dont know. All I do know is that this world contains more evil than can ever be imagined.The evil of the Cult of Cthulhu is still out there and I know that my days are numbered. I have seen too much. One day they will come for me and, when they do, I will let them take me. I have tried to end my life a number of times and now reside in an asylum as a result. Death will come as a relief for me.It has taken me a great deal of effort to write this, since every fibre of my being has tried to block out the memories of what happened at that university. But I need you to know. I need you to be prepared. The Cult of Cthulhu is alive and well and, one day, Cthulhu will rise and destroy this planet. It is only a matter of time.Darkness.I didnt know who I was or where I was. All I could tell was that I was falling lower and lower into a deep oblivion of blackness.Though I was unafraid.Was I dead?It didnt matter.In that place, nothing mattered.I was at peace.And then I was jerked roughly back into reality, though reality had become so distorted in my mind that I could scarcely tell the difference between what was real and what was fantasy. The first thing that I became aware of was a searing pain across my abdomen. I tried to scream, but my throat was sore as though I had been screaming for hours already. I attempted to move my arms but they were locked in place and I realised to my horror that the pain was from ropes that had been tied around me so tightly that they were literally cutting into my flesh. I spluttered for a moment as the sights and sounds of the world started to come back to me. I was tied upside down to the obelisk in the centre of the ritual space I had seen the previous night and my worst fears were realised.I was covered in blood, though whether it was my own or that of another unfortunate victim I couldnt tell. A fire surrounded me and on the other side of the flames, people in black robes were dancing wildly making noises that sounded neither human nor beastly. I began to wonder why I was still alive and why I had not been dismembered like Jonathan.Then one of the participants stepped through the flames, emerging unharmed beside me. He brandished a long silver knife and screamed \"Cthulhu Fhtagn!\" at the heavens. The figure turned down to look at me. It was Jacob, though it wasnt Jacobs eyes that looked at me, rather an empty, soulless shell of a human being. He raised the knife and I began to pray silently, expecting the end. Though it wasnt me he plunged the knife into, it was himself. He rammed the blade up to the hilt into his stomach and violently jerked it upwards, sending gory sprays of arterial blood all over my face and into my mouth and nose. Jacob then reached into his chest and began to pull out his internal organs, laughing maniacally as he did so. It was then that I found my voice and screamed louder than I had ever done, though my cries were drowned out by the diabolical beat of the drums and the bestial chants of the other cultists.Jacob did not fall to the ground as anyone else would have done. Instead, he cracked open his ribcage, revealing his empty chest cavity. An unseen force then ripped his head back, nearly severing it, his spine bent backwards and cracked and then his limbs began bending into odd angles as well. All the while, he continued in his demonic laughter, the chants of the cultists and the beat of the drums growing and growing. He contorted spasmodically, and shadowy tendrils sprung out of his body, twisting as they reached up to the sky. Suddenly, Jacobs body exploded in a shower of blood and offal although his ghoulish laugh seemed to continue somehow, and out of nowhere appeared many small winged creatures. They were less than three feet in height and completely black. No detail of their bodies was visible save for a pair of glowing green eyes. They swooped around the obelisk to which I was tied, uttering a shrieking sound unlike anything I had ever heard. As they shrieked, the dancing, chanting and beating of the drums got louder and wilder until, at its climax, the ground itself started rumbling. Cracks started to appear in the ground and water started gushing out causing the obelisk to crumble, but the fire burned ever brighter.Due to the destruction of the obelisk, the bonds that were around my middle loosened slightly. But as I tried to rise, I was violently pushed down into the water by one of the cultists who cried,\"Mighty Cthulhu! Accept our sacrifice of blood and rise again!\" With that he drew a knife of his own, but before he was able to end my existence, one of the shadowy winged creatures flew into his chest, disappearing in an instant. Suddenly, the cultists eyes literally burst into flames and he began reciting the chant I had heard so many times: \"Cthulhu Fhtagn! Cthulhu Fhtagn!\" His mouth then opened wide and I could hear his jaw bone break. Long teeth extended from the gums and before I could react, he lurched forward sinking them into my forearm.This new pain was just what I needed. I screamed in agony and ripped free. Quickly loosening the bonds around me, I leapt through the fire. Its searing heat scorched me and I felt as though a thousand knives were simultaneously being plunged into my skin. I looked desperately around for an opening to escape and noticed that all the cultists now had flaming eyes and were running at me screaming even as their heads burned in the flames from their eyes. I turned and fled, not caring about the pain in my arm or the fire that was rapidly consuming me. Not caring about the thorns and branches that eviscerated me as I ran past them. I knew I just needed to get as far away as possible.Although the screams of the ritual participants had begun to fade, I did not slow down. I just kept going and did not look back.", "Rodrigo [possessed] - \"The flies are their own lords, and ours as well.\"Benevento Chieti Bordighera - Massa di Requiem per ShuggayColonel Reginald Barnes wiped his sweating brow and cursed the infernal swamp. He double cursed the countless insects that seemed to make up the entire population of this sodden hell. He turned and motioned his men to halt. They were a hearty group, but the hardships of the swamp were bearing down on them. All were tired, their muscles aching, and most had open sores which the wretched little vermin were viciously exploiting.Private Sands was buried a few miles back, victim of some malignant strain of malaria that ignored quinine and killed within hours. The colonel wondered for a moment about the natives warnings. The natives had cautioned them to avoid this swamp, and the blacks feared this place so much that their normally loyal bearers had fled like rabbits rather than enter the lair of the insect god. As far as Barnes pidgin could make out, the natives believed that a giant insect lived within the swamp, ruling all its lesser kin. To add even greater spice to the tale, it was something of a Typhoid Mary, a many-legged Horseman of Pestilence. Rubbish, to be sure, but this swamp was undeniably unhealthy, as poor Private Sands had learned.Still, this was part of The Kings realm, and as such it was to be charted and explored. Any natives, (and he personally doubted even the hardiest of the Africans could survive in this God-forsaken place), introduced to the Enlightenment that came with British colonization.They were suffering for God, King and Country.That didnt make it any less painful.Humans were entering his domain. Not the natives, they knew of Him. They had the wisdom to avoid Him. Not so with these creatures. They were explorers and soldiers, enforcing the will of their mortal King in behalf of their flickering shadow of an empire. They were determined to come. To claim this land for their empire of dust.But this was His empire. His land. He had been driven from His world, from Shaggai. The Harbinger and The Worm That Gnaws In The Night had driven Him from His home. He had searched for centuries to find sanctuary. He would not give up His new home in the face of humanity.Baoht Zuqqa-Mogg stirred sluggishly, pulling His vast bulk from the slime and mire. He shook the muck from His six wings. Many-faceted eyes surveyed the area. The humans had wandered far too close to his lair. He bore no malice toward men, but He could not allow His realm to be infested by the violent ape-things.Such was His power that little could live in His presence. One had already perished, the swarms had infected them all. In the unlikely event any of them lived long enough to reach other humans they would set off a plague. Such weak creatures, these humans.It was an act of mercy, really.The swarms were intense, mosquitoes, tsetse flies and insects even the most knowledgeable of the men could not identify vied for a taste of their blood. One could barely see his hands in front of his face for the blood-thirsty little horrors. Still they pressed on, through baking heat and boiling humidity. Barnes could almost believe that some great insect god ruled this dark, dismal boil on the face of the earth. He sincerely hoped that the His Majesty would let the Germans have this sweltering hellhole.\"Sir,\" Private Carter pointed out, \"The swarms. Theres nothin else, sir. I mean, no animals. No birds. Just insects.\"\"Theyre just hiding, private. Ive seen a few snakes and lizards about. Animals have a natural fear of man. Nothing to bother about.\" In truth, Barnes himself wondered about the lack of wildlife. It was true that animals, even large ones, would hide from a company of men, but the absence of birds of any kind was disturbing. Even in the Sahara, hed seen birds. A swamp in the heart of Africa should be positively teeming with them. His hands went over his Rigby. Hed taken down a charging bull elephant in Malaya with that gun.He slid in a cartridge.He wondered for a moment if he were ill, thinking of using a Rigby on a swarm of infernal insects.A horrible smell filled the thick air, an overpowering reek of swamp stench and death. The men turned as one as something thundered through the thick trees and muck toward them.What came crashing through the brush was no earthly insect. Over six metres of horror reared up before them. It was a titanic perversion of a scorpion. The head was vaguely suggestive of a walnut, albeit covered with gleaming yellow eyes and twitching antennae. Yellow bile dripped from sharp mandibles, hissing as it hit the soggy ground. Its greenish-black body was thick and armored, dripping ichor, wet mud and maggots. Three sets of tattered, membranous wings and ten spindly, clawed legs sprouted from its thorax. It had the massive pincers and thick, segmented tail of a scorpion. More of the yellow venom dripped from the creatures metre long stinger. Disgusting vermin crawled across its foul body, surrounded it in thick clouds and seemed to pour from the segments between its exoskeleton.\"Its Beelzebub himself!\" Someone shouted. From the look of the thing, Barnes was inclined to agree.He raised his rifle, The Lord of The Flies, eh? Lets see how he holds up against the might of The British Empire!No order was needed. Barnes let loose with his Rigby as the men began to fire. The .450 Nitro Express struck the beast square in the head, eliciting little more than an angry hiss. A shot meant for taking down rhinoceros and elephants barely seemed to sting the abomination. The swarm was upon them before he could reload. The Rigby fell from his hands as Barnes fell to his knees, then collapsed into the mud. The screams of his men were almost drowned out by the insidious buzzing and overwhelming sensation of weakness that swept through his form. Wormwood. . . He thought as the world grew dark about him.A thin trickle of yellow ichor flowed from the injured eye. It hurt, but the wound was already healing. Baoht Zuqqa-Mogg picked up the weapon in His right claw, examined it. It was a crude device, but it had drawn blood. The humans were growing stronger. Smarter, in their own primitive way. And bolder. The day might come when He would have to fight them in numbers to protect His land. He snapped the weapon in two with His claw and cast it into the mud. He looked over the dying men, prying from their feeble, fevered brains the identity of this Beelzebub they took Him for. It was an unfair comparison in His eyes, but understandable given their limited intellects. He quickly slew them all, sparing them the agony of slow death by infection.The wound was completely healed as The Bringer of Pestilence nestled once more into the comfortable muck and mire of the swamp. His home was secure, for now."]}
{"id": "EN064", "pair": ["The Inn stands at the end of our largest thoroughfare, which is a few blocks long, but seems a thousand miles. With my heavy valise, Im fortunate that I only have to walk half that far from the restaurant at which Ive just dined. Once every month, I scrounge up enough money to have dinner at the Golden Goose. Despite my reputation in this village, I eventually come to long for the clamor of a crowd. The four walls of my fathers house are my sanctuary and prison otherwise. Only Theodora, our cook and housekeeper that weve had since before I was born, keeps me company there. I would take her with me on my monthly outings to Leights sole restaurant, but she stubbornly says she prefers her own meals all the same.Thats only part of the reason why she wont go, however. Ive told her that even at the Golden Goose, the diners there glare at me out of the corners of their eyes and lower them to their plates if I look their way. Theodora is an even more self-contained soul than I am, and loathes being stared at \"by all and sundry\".The evening sun is sinking low on the horizon, and the villagers around me are concealed in shadows. I dont want anyone coming up and asking me about my three-night errand - not that they would. When I prove the rumors about my forefathers establishment wrong, Ill make them all look like fools anyway!Those unfamiliar with Leight will notice three ever-present things as they travel down its main street: stalwart people, churches, and Cemetery Hill looming in the distance. Ever since I was a child, I sensed an eerie connection among these features of our humble village. Just what that is, I cannot say. They are ordinary enough on the surface, and yet I cant help feeling that theres something sinister about them.My neighbors are proud, hard-working souls. Most of them live on farms on the outskirts of town. Even so, they trudge nearly every day to its center in order to seek supplies. The men of Leight are burly, with long arms and sunburnt faces, trusting in their toil and suspicious of learnt folk. Its just as well that theyre illiterate. They wouldnt have much use for books even if they had the coin to buy them. Their wives, far from being what some people would call ladies, are just as industrious and sturdy as their husbands. I see them more often in town, as buying sundries is womens work, but that doesnt mean theyre any more inclined to talk to me. They keep to themselves, as I do, but it seems their hearts are under lock and key.I suspect that a large part of this has to do with the fact that they fear God as much as my familys past. Out of every ten buildings in Leight, at least four are churches. The Baptists, Catholics, Episcopalians, Evangelicals, Lutherans, Methodists, and even more denominations are continually at war. They each claim to believe in the Scriptures, and in the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. However, they also claim that all the others are false, to a greater or lesser degree. As for me? I attend no house of worship, and that is no great loss to me. My father, Lemuel Dawson, said that his own chapel - the one on Cemetery Hill - had been abruptly shuttered one Halloween night. His fellow congregants then fled to other nearby towns.\"My dear Millie,\" he had told me, \"the one true church on this Earth has been lost, and a year too early.\" Thats another thing Ive failed to understand, even though it haunts me as much as the Inn itself does.Hurrying to get there, I pass the people and churches without much concern. Only the visage of the former Gallows Hill, now containing graves instead of a gibbet, catches my eye. Buried there are not only the fifty-three souls who were hanged during the Purge (or so we called our witchcraft panic), but criminals and paupers. Ive often wondered why having no money is considered as great a crime as sorcery or theft, but in this village, if youre poor, then you are cursed. \"God helps those who help themselves\": so say we. I cannot help myself as I find my feet sprinting rather than walking toward the façade of the Dreamers Inn.The sky, now a cool blue-violet twilight, is growing dark. Ill soon leave light (and Leight?) behind. Even though Ive been inside the Dreamers Inn countless times, Ive always been a bit scared of the place. Why is it that, even though its supposed to be a haven for travelers, it seems like a mausoleum instead? I know that once I venture beyond its door, beneath the rickety sign that has announced its presence since the days of Abner Dawes, Ill be in a world unto itself. As such, I pause on the threshold and gaze up at its intimidating turret. Should I turn back and forget about spending a single night there, let alone three?Then I remember my reasons, both monetary and otherwise, and step inside.", "\"Great Cthulhu looks favorably upon your sacrifices.\" Torren-Wraeth swept his arms expansively before the congregation, \"And your faith pleases him greatly.\" He had been summoned, he hated being summoned, but it was his duty. \"What is your desire?\" A fire blazed on the stone alter behind him, and dark-robed humans knelt before the child of their god as a tentacular, vaguely toad-like being known colloquially as a \"Servitor of the Outer Gods\", (His personal name was Grix), piped away on a bone flute. The High Priest, distinguished by his rich green robes, stood, \"We seeketh only a small boon from thy sire.\" Torren-Wraeth rolled his eyes mentally, why did humans always use that annoying Archaic English in religious rights. Cthulhu didnt speak English, let alone Ye Olde English. \"What is it?\" The priest then began a short list of needs, more game to hunt, more rain for the crops, as if Cthulhu could magically make them appear. Well, he could make rain, at least, but not animals... Animal life had flourished since The Great Arising, with so few humans left to hunt them, these people had probably been careless, overtaxing their resources...\"Rain will not be a problem,\" Torren-Wraeth said confidently, then, \"But animals and good crops are more in the domain of Shub-Niggurath.\" Grix stopped piping and eyed Torren-Wraeth in surprise. The priest looked confused, the congregation certainly was. \"Canst thou not aid us?\" Torren-Wraeth considered for a moment, Cthulhu could drive animals toward this village, but could he make crops grow? \"He can send rain and more game animals for you to hunt, but as for the growing of crops, you will likely have to either trust your luck or make sacrifices to Cernunos.\" That avatar of Shub-Niggurath was closely associated with agriculture, and Cthulhu didnt mind sharing his worshipers. Torren-Wraeth knew of one god he didnt want the people to follow, however. \"And by The Key and The Gate dont start worshiping He-Who-Walks-Between-the-Rows!\" Lightning struck near the entrance of the church, fusing sand to glass, \"If you sacrifice to him, Ill kill you all myself!\" The congregation recoiled in terror. A steady rain began to fall outside the church. The congregation, forgetting their confusing, terrifying angel, and went wild. \"PRAISE CTHULHU!\" \"IA! IA! CTHULHU NAFLFHTAGN!\"Great Cthulhu held court from his green-black graven throne in the Temple of The Key and The Gate. Though many worshiped him as a god or feared him as a devil, the Lord of RLyeh was in truth a high priest of Yog-Sothoth. Not that he discouraged his own worship, even as his own clerics, Father Dagon and Mother Hydra, gladly accepted the worshipful adulation of the lesser races. There were plenty of eager and fearful acolytes for everyone.Later, after the humans had all driven or drunken themselves into noisy slumber, Grix rolled over to Torren-Wraeth, who sat cross-legged and disgusted on the cold stone floor. \"Your father may not be pleased that you shattered his image of omnipotence.\" \"Should I give these people lies?\" Torren-Wraeth spoke freely, no one there but the two of them understood Grix tongue. Grix laughed, a peculiar gurgling sound, \"Isnt it all a lie, in the end? You made it rain, not your father. I could have, too, if I had wanted.\" Torren-Wraeth sighed, not knowing how to respond, then took the pipe from Grix slimy tentacles and began to play.Torren-Wraeth had some friends and allies, human or otherwise. Tektaktequataquarl, a True-Blood Hastur-Spawn. An unlikely friend, certainly, as Hastur and Cthulhu were grave enemies, and Hasturs Spawn were no more given to emotion in any human standard than those of his nemesis. Tek was an exception, wild, emotional, maybe even a little bit crazy, even by the standards of The King in Tatters. He took human form, male, beautiful, gold skin and gleaming wings, though in truth he was a hermaphroditic golden mass of flesh, tendrils, eyes and mouths. As Hastur-Spawn, he was unwelcome in Cthulhus court, but he ignored the threats with the casual indifference of an immortal, perhaps he even found a perverse pleasure in visiting enemy territory. Besides, his mate, the Bloated Woman, also known as the Goddess of the Black Fan, lived in the mountains of China. Seven feet tall, six hundred pounds of blubber and writhing tendrils topped with five vicious mouths and a pair of exquisitely beautiful eyes. When holding the Black Fan under her eyes, she was slim and beautiful, a mask for luring men to a gruesome death. Ironically, Tek found the true form more appealing, a form so similar to his own... Regardless, Cthulhu would never dare move against her, for The Bloated Woman was an avatar of the only being Cthulhu truly feared, Nyarlathotep. To anger Nyarlathotep meant horrors even Great Cthulhu dare not imagine. Torren-Wraeth did not care much for the cruel Goddess, but, in some strange way, Tek loved her. Torren-Wraeth had no way of knowing if the feeling was reciprocated, one never knew with The Crawling Chaos...Then there were the Insects from Shaggai, who had dwelt in Englands Severn valley for centuries, repairing their temple-ship. They brought with them their experiences, their dreams and nightmares of far-off wonders; The cities of long-dead Shaggai, the titanic natives of Thuggon, of Lghhx, Xiclotl and Tond. They had finally escaped earth shortly before The Great Arising. They had been cruel and twisted beings, but living their mortal memories made Torren-Wraeth long to visit these worlds, where eyeless giants strode teeming marshes and suns blazed black in amber skies. He sometimes used his skills at bending space and reality to take brief jaunts to these worlds. But he always came back. He could not seem to break earths hold on him, the ties of birth and blood were too strong.In his house at RLyeh Torren-Wraeth slept poorly. His home, small by Cthuli standards, was the size of a cathedral, one large room with a stone bed covered by warm blankets and a square, shallow pool of flowing seawater that served as a bath. A low stone shelf held an image of Goro, preserved forever beneath unbreakable, transparent alien stone. Several books, scrolls and tablets lay scattered about, and the room, from floor to ceiling, was covered with elaborate carvings of alien worlds and incredible creatures. A grim looking Moai sat in a corner, looking out over the green-black structure. A small chest of amber-colored stone, strongly contrasting the general color scheme, held Torren-Wraeths clothing.He rose from his bed and walked across the cool floor to the open portal, staring out at the fickle stars that flickered in the night sky. Isnt it all a lie in the end? He sighed, then turned to the chest and began to dress.Ho Fong stood at the gates of the Monastery of The Bloated Woman, catching the first rays of sunlight. He was old, centuries had passed since he became high priest of The Order of The Bloated Woman, yet time held no power over him. He appeared to be in his early fifties, without even a gray hair. Someone, an American, no doubt, had once insultingly compared him to the fictional Chinese villain Fu Manchu. In truth, he did resemble a significantly heavier version of the Devil Doctor, complete with the signature moustache. Hed killed the man, of course. The Goddess required sacrifices, after all. As the golden light began to bath the magnificent mountains of China in divine splendor, he thought about The Other. He did not worship lord Tektaktequataquarl, as he didnt seem to desire worship, but was obliged to give him all due respect as the Goddess consort. Tek was coming, of course. The only constant in that being of chaos life was his love for the Goddess, a love Ho Fong envied, though he could never bring himself to admit it. He straightened his yellow and black silk robes, the official garb of the Order, and prepared to greet the Hastur-Spawn.The monastery was fairly new, The Order had once had centers in Shanghai and on Gray Dragon Island, but these had been lost in 1926. Enemies of The Order had overwhelmed and destroyed them. Much had been lost, and Ho Fong himself had nearly been killed. These had been powerful setbacks, but, in the end, they had been immaterial, as both Shanghai and Gray Dragon Island now lay lost beneath the waves. Ho Fongs enemies, The Goddess enemies, were all long dead. He walked back into the monastery, passing lesser monks and acolytes who bowed dutifully toward him, and approached the great bronze doors behind which the Goddess rested. Two burly monks opened the doors and Ho Fong respectfully approached the screens of yellow and black silk that lay beyond the carven jade sacrificial alter.The Bloated Woman sat upon a pile of silken cushions, smoking essence of Black Lotus from an ornate hookah, its pipe in her third mouth. The Black Fan and six sacred golden sickles, used to dispatch human sacrifices, hung from a black silk sash wrapped around her prodigious belly. The priest bowed deeply to his beloved Goddess. \"He will not be here for some time yet.\" The Goddess voice was smooth and sultry. \"Receive him warmly.\" She blew fragrantly scented smoke from her fourth mouth, whilst speaking through her second and first.Tektaktequataquarl flapped his gleaming wings in the bright morning sun. He felt Torren-Wraeths approach long before he could see him. He was a good kid, level-headed and thoughtful, the total opposite of Tek himself. Perhaps that was why he liked him, a balance of chaos and order. Yin and Yang, so to speak. Ever since his human confidant had died, the Half-Blood had become more sullen and withdrawn. He needed more excitement in his life. Perhaps Tek himself needed less, courting an avatar of Nyarlathotep. Even Hastur had expressed concern about that union, but love is blind. She was evil, in human terms, but, then again, by human terms she was hideous. He found her beautiful and dangerous. He wondered what their coming offspring would be like...He suddenly realized something had changed. Torren-Wraeth was in trouble, his life was in danger. He turned back and sped toward the Half-Blood..."]}
{"id": "EN004", "pair": ["Birth RightMantineus-Im more Mr. Briggs, than the I this time.Disclaimer-I own nothing!I\"Im gonna burn.\"Thats when I knew it got really bad. He was always a little nuts, but that. Saying it with an innocent smile and certainty. It sent chills up my spine and I experienced a fear I have not faced in my entire life.It was at this point that I realized that he really was beyond saving.How he got like this, god only knows. Before he was admitted to my sanitarium I checked his background. It was clean. His mother and father were decently sane, as were his grandparents and siblings. I checked hospital files and came up with nothing out of the ordinary. Colds, flu, and a few scrapes. Normal for any boy.Upon his arrival I waited in my office, glancing at the anniversary clock that adorned my desk religiously. Despite its bad memory, I couldnt stand to throw it away, so in my office it has stayed. Poor Lucinda.With annoyance, I watched as an orderly struggled to seat him in a chair. He was antsy and, from what I gathered, he felt he needed to be somewhere else.\"Hello,\" I said gently, hoping to direct his attention on me so that the orderly could strap him in the chair.For my protection as well as his. On the ride here he was without a straitjacket and chipped his nails and teeth trying to escape and then from trying to fatally tear his wrists open with the aforementioned parts. God only knew what he would try to do to me if I stepped out of his line.Finally, we were alone. He thrashed about for a minute before I began.\"Hello,\" I began. \"Im your new doctor.\"From there he stared at me with eyes of steel. It unnerved me; it was like he was looking through me and saw my soul. He kept staring and my psychologists nerve was faltering. Mentally I was panicking and I wondered if, due to his stoic stare, if he was looking deeper than my outer appearance of fear.My childhood flashed before my eyes.\"So doc,\" He began, his voice was gravely and deep. \"Whats your first question?\"This took me by surprise that I had to clear my throat, tap my papers back into place, and start again.\"Yes, well. You see, Ive checked your records, Mr.-\"\"Dont say it!\" He screamed, face twisting into pure, unimaginable fear. \"They might not know Im here!\"\"Whos they?\"His snapped. As if the fearful shell broke and revealed this manic, demented smile. It seemed sadistic and menacing, yet what he said was pure jibber-jabber.\"Them, doc!\" He said. His face changed again; he was stumped. \"You mean you dont know, doc? Surely youve encountered others like me.\"\"No,\" I agreed. \"Im afraid I havent.\"He began to laugh. It was long and insane. Yet, as abruptly as it began, it ended and he could have passed for a sane person within that silent second.\"Then give up this case, doc.\" He said, a chuckle escaping his throat. \"Give it to someone who knows!\"If only I listened.IIAs the sessions progressed, I admit to feeling a slight disheartenment. He would reveal nothing of his condition other than ramblings like before. Though, one day he did something of note.He was rocking back and forth in a big, exaggerated way. He would swing forward, mumble something then swing back and shout a made up word.For example, on his first forward rock he would mumble something akin to a sneeze then shout \"Fhtagn!\" Yog-soth \"Fhtagn!\" Oz-soth \"Fhtagn!\"He then began to say another strange word, of which I surmised were names, when he stopped. He got so far as \"Nya\" when he began to giggle like a lunatic and rock his torso rapidly while repeating that strange made up word.\"Fhtagn! Fhtagn! Fhtagn!\"\"Mr.-\"He began to scream as if in agony. From previous sessions, I knew it was most likely from my trying to utter his name. But, unlike previous times where he would instantly stop, he began to sob. His face flushed crimson, his eyes became slits from whence tears began to flow.\"The Necronomicon!\" He screamed, his sobs becoming more intense. \"De…Destroy….Destroy it!\"\"What?\"\"Destroy the Necronomicon!\" He shouted, he looked a mixture of agony and rage. \"Destroy it! Destroy that damn book!\"Five minutes after that outburst he stopped. Despite the still flushed face and teary eyes, he looked as if it never happened. And with that deep, gravelly voice he spoke.\"Destroy it doc.\" The intense glare he gave me sent me flashes of hellfire and promises of pain and horror the likes of which Ill never comprehend.\"Destroy it. Dont look at it, dont read it, and-whatever you do-Dont look at the back page!\"Two sessions after that he seemed to follow back into our usual routine. That is, until our third. It was then that he said what I knew was the truth. He was gone to the sane world. And despite our other methods, they would not be enough to bring him back.\"Im gonna burn.\" He said, then, with an exaggerated nod he began. \"Yep. Im gonna burn that damn book.\"\"And why would you burn it?\" I asked.He clammed up.Miskatonic University. I have been there, of course, as a student of psychology. Hoping to better myself in understanding the people around me; a curse of a recluse, Im afraid. Though I have never heard of such a book, my curiosity had gotten the better of me and I sent a letter to the Miskatonic Library.A few days later a package arrived for me with a note. The Librarian was slightly against me looking at it, but considering my profession, she allowed it. But I was to return it within a timely manner. I did not flip through it. I cannot explain why, but I felt a sense of doom upon glancing at the ancient tome.But, at least, I had something to talk about in our next session.III\"I have the book.\" I started.His eyes picked up. He smiled like a child at Christmas morning before unwrapping his gifts. He started to shake the chair he was chained to. Rapidly he asked questions like \"You didnt read it did you?\" and \"Did you burn it? If you did, can I see the ashes?\"\"No, I didnt read it.\" I confessed. \"Nor,\" I placed the book on my desk. \"Have I burned it; as you can see.\"\"Burn it!\" He shouted. \"Burn it!\"His eyes grew wide in fear.\"Theyll be coming! They sense its presence! Its an unholy beacon! Burn it! Burn it and destroy their only chance for this world!\"\"Not yet.\" I said. \"Not until you tell me why such a normal man would succumb to madness without any reason.\"His emotions changed from frantic to anger in a flash. He started to growl and shake the chair more violently. Either it is due to the cases similar to a grandmother gaining superhuman strength when their grandchild is in danger, or perhaps they did not switch the chains and after dealing with his constant mood swings, they gave. Either way, he was free.Free and wild, like a bull, he charged towards me. I dont know what compelled me to throw the book, but I did. I threw it before he was upon it. And I know, right there, I made a mistake.For when it landed, it landed on the last page where an artists rendition of the writer was present. I stared upon it, mouth agape.\"No!\" He shouted. \"Its all over now.\" He began to sob. \"I didnt want to do this!\" He then sparked up, looking hopeful. \"Wait! Its not too late! You can still reject it! Reject the responsibility and let humanity thrive!\"\"What are you talking about?\" I managed to say.My mind was beginning to form an explanation as to why the famous \"Mad Arab\" looked like me.\"Yes, traitor, what are you talking about?\"\"Nyar…\"He cracked up. \"Nyar…\" He chuckled like a mad man.The new comer was dressed in Ancient Egyptian robes and crown. He was magnificent and regal in appearance. But another sense took over and I wanted to run away from him as quickly as possible. But something caught my eye. Without the help of hand or wind, the pages began to flip back until it reached its goal. The page prior had a picture of him as he was seen now. To the right were the bold words:Nyarlathotep: The Crawling ChaosHe turned towards me. Within those cold black eyes I could see a swirling mass, similar to a galaxy, only different. And, if I strained my ears, I swore I heard the mad playing of deranged flautists.\"Do forgive me, Abdul.\" He said. \"But…\"\"Thats not my name.\" I began. \"My name is…\"\"Not important.\" He said, cutting me off. \"What is, is who you were and who you are meant to be. Abdul Hazred, the Mad Arab and priest to both Cthulhu and Yog-Sothoth.\"Flashes of desert expanses flew by within my mind. A lone man walked alone the desert, walking through an old, abandoned city that once belonged to a reptilian race of humanoids. How he dedicated his remaining years(which was not many) to write the book of which they wanted and whos information he gained through dreams and through physical means.He died and his soul became one with Yog-Sothoth until thirty-four years ago. I was plagued with nightmares and horrible sights that now no longer fill me with dread. Though what my parents did still leaves a mark. But then again, it happened to Abdul, too.(1)\"What is needed of me, Oh mighty Nyarlathotep?\"\"No!\" He shouted, but Nyarlathotep shot him an angry glare.\"I will deal with you later.\" He turned and faced me once more. \"But for now, Abdul must be briefed on what is expected of him.\"You have written The Necronomicon rather well. But, They now wish for you to write one more piece to it. This one will explain what will happen once They are awakened and how to stop the stars from changing again. Youll receive these in dreams once more. But this time, youll receive help in the form of Mr. Briggs, there.\"He cowered in fear of his own surname.\"That is, if you need help.\"\"No,\" I said. \"I shall write this myself. Besides, you called him a traitor. He is not fit to help write such a glorious book.\"\"No!\" He shouted. He had a letter opener in his hands. He was digging through my desk while we were talking. \"He will not write the missing chapter!\"He lunged at me, but was stopped by a loud buzzing sound.\"Id run if I were you.\" Nyarlathotep said.Mr. Briggs did not heed his warning, and lunged at me once more. A Mi-go crashed through the window and grabbed him with his crab-like claws and whisked him out of my office and the sanitarium all together, being prepared for his trip to Yuggoth.\"Do not disappoint me.\" He said and vanished.------ ------1) I know, according to historians, that Abdul Hazred was actually Lovecraft. But, since hes a made up character, why not give him a made up childhood? I am not implying that he was beaten as a child!", "The Judas Mark\"Cthulhu ftaghn,\" He said with a laugh, swaying his tilted head to the right in a drunken manner. \"Cthulhu ftaghn.\"He broke out into a laughing fit. Then as quickly as it started it stopped; like the lightning bolt outside his window. Arkham was his place of work. And as a patient, his work was hard to complete. Not like he wanted to do it, either.The rain stopped.\"I hear youuuuuuu.\" He chuckled. \"I hear you flapping those blasted wings outside my windah.\" He giggled, then sobered up. \"Damn Migo. YA CANT HAVE MY BRAIN!\"There came a drum of plastic on metal as his attention was drawn to the orderly with a plastic flashlight. Aforementioned light shining into his padded room.\"Keep it down in there!\" The orderly snapped before leaving him alone once again.\"Power outage, eh?\" He chuckled. \"Wonder whyyyy.\"He rolled his head back to his right; towards his window. His eyes registered the sound of unearthly wings twitching like insects contemplating flight. Oh how he hated those damn things. Far worse than those Shoggoths he faced a while back. At least the Shoggoths ate you; thus ending your torment. But a Migo…He shuttered. He did not want to think about it.\"Nyarlahotep…You son of a bitch.\" He said, looking grumpy, then broke out in hysterics, then going back as if it never happened. \"If it werent for you…Id be…Id be…\"Where would he be? In his mind, he saw himself in Miami, laying on the beach with Lucinda, their two kids playing in the sand as the waves crashed soothingly onto the shore. But then his logic would kick that to the curb. Lucinda was showing signs…She would have dumped him if it werent for that Deep One, that is, dragging her-kicking and screaming-to the bottom of the sea.He would be away from his insane parents. That insane town of Dunwich. Even if Lucinda did not accompany him, he would, at least, be free from here. But then he met him.\"Jesus…\"\"Yes?\" Came a sweet, velvety voice. A voice one would hear from royalty.\"Not you.\" He snapped.\"But I am him.\" A hand placed itself on his shoulder as the entire figure appeared, sitting beside him like they were best friends.\"No...Youre the fucking antichrist.\"\"Is there really a difference in that either?\" Jesus asked, a smirk gracing his regal, black lips. \"Both promise paradise. From there, its on a persons opinion on what that is.\" He chuckled. \"And do not tell me that you forgot your title, Ivan…Or should I say Judas?\"\"THEN WHY PLACE ME HERE?\" Ivan shouted.\"Hey!\" The orderly shouted, banging his flashlight on the bars again. \"What did I just say?\"The orderlys face began to bubble. His flesh boiled, broken screams erupted from his face. He collapsed and scratched at his face, letting more and more blood poor onto the floor.\"I hate interruptions.\" Jesus said. \"And as for your answer…Because. If Jesus was as all powerful as he claimed, why did he allow Judas to stay in the fold? Why did he allow the lowly wretches hope? Why did I command Tython to drag Lucinda down to the depths to suffer being rendered by hungry maws before she could drown?\"He smirked evilly as he described Lucindas gruesome demise. Ivan panted heavily, his rage rising faster than Rlyeh ever would to the surface. Ivan struck thin air as his body moved too slow for the deity; whom was already standing, laughing at the mortal.\"Because theres more to it, Judas.\" Jesus said. \"Judas of old was an important player in the world. The wretches were a growing populace, if they loved him, they would worship him.\"\"Bullshit!\" He spat.\"Is it?\"\"We want you to betray us, Judas.\" Jesus said after his question was ignored.\"Why?\"\"Sorry, but us Christs keep some secrets from their disciples.\"\"What makes you Jesus?\"\"Our roles.\" He stated simply. \"You see…He was supposed to preach about us. But, sadly, his mind couldnt take it. So Cthulhu became a god. Not like it matters, religion changes all the time.\"He smirked, all knowing. \"And no, he wasnt the son of Cthulhu. That was my little trick.\"\"Pray Judas,\" He said from behind Ivan-not allowing him to speak-his black, decaying lips mere inches from his ear. \"He likes that. It makes him feel powerful.\"\"No,\" Ivan said. \"I shall not ya damned bastard! And I wont bring about their reawakening! These crazies will remain sedated!\"Jesus laughed.\"Thats my cue.\"Jesus grabbed Ivan by the neck and slammed his body against the wall. Buzzing from outside the window grew from a silent drone into a frenzy. Jesus smirked evilly, drawing his face closer to his Judas.\"In blood the mark is drawn.\"Nyarlahotep drew the blade he was hiding and slashed Ivans wrist, splattering drops of blood on the wall. He watched in delight as the drops spread, several linking up and continuing their intricate design.It consisted of a crude circle with intertwining tentacles and a pair of piercing eyes.\"There,\" He said. \"Done.\"He tossed Ivan. He landed next to the window and as he peered out of it he clearly saw the glowing heads and beating wings of the Migo, their forms slightly covered by the rain that began to fall again.\"Enjoy your trip, Judas.\" Nyarlahotep said. \"For though I am done with you, you still serve a purpose.\"The Migo swarmed, the window shattering like paper. Ivan barely had time to scream as they worked on his skull, amputating his brain and placing it inside their jar.\"Cthulhu ftagn, indeed.\""]}
{"id": "EN084", "pair": ["The world we live in is not as it seems. I, James White, write this document so that others may be made aware of what I have experienced and know of the dangers that lurk beneath our limited perception of \"reality\". Whether you believe me or not, dear reader, is up to you. I only ask that you read what I write with an open mind since I write, not for my own gain, but to warn you of what I can only describe as \"pure evil\".I had never heard of the \"Cult of Cthulhu\" before I began university in the late summer of 2012. I was only eighteen years old, an atheist, and dogmatically pursued scientific understanding and knowledge. At that time, I was not in the least bit interested in weird cults and other religious movements, which I simply dismissed as primitive superstition. Had I but known what I would encounter, I would have burnt the science textbook, prayed to God for the strength not to crumble into insanity and got as far away from that university as I could!The strange happenings started less than two months into my first term. I had been put into student accommodation and shared a corridor with four other boys and two girls. I had got to know my flatmates very well until all of a sudden, one of the boys by the name of Jonathan Mears disappeared. This wasnt looked upon as weird at first since Jonathan was the quiet type anyway and often spent long hours alone in his room. The suspicions arose however, when he hadnt shown his face for three days. His absence was brought up one evening as we sat in a communal area.\"Hes probably just been very busy lately,\" my best friend, Jacob Shields, said. \"You know Jonathan. When he sets his mind on something, he doesnt stop until hes achieved whatever hes trying to do.\"\"Isnt it a bit strange though?\" Annie Roberts, a lovely blonde girl from the room directly across the corridor asked. \"I mean, hes in our corridor and we havent seen him for ages. Not even in the kitchen or lecture halls.\"\"It isnt like him to miss a lecture,\" I agreed. Jacob merely waved these concerns away.\"If we havent seen him by tomorrow evening, well go to the reception and see whats happening,\" he said cheerfully.But Jonathan didnt show up the following day and, as planned, my entire corridor went to the reception desk to ask if anything had happened to him. The receptionist, an elderly lady, checked through the files on a computer before looking up at us.\"Im afraid he has left the university,\" she informed us. \"He dropped out four days ago.\"\"Well there you go!\" Jacob exclaimed. \"Nothing to worry about!\"But there was something to worry about. Even though I now had every reason to think that Jonathan was fine, I couldnt shake that feeling of foreboding. He had seemed happy in university and was consistently getting high marks so I resolved to check things out for myself.I waited until 3:00 the following morning, and in the darkness, I tiptoed along the corridor to Jonathans room. Using a paperclip, I carefully picked the lock on his door and let myself in. I closed the door behind me and switched on the light. The sight that greeted me came as a huge shock. Clothes still lay on the floor, the bed was made, books were still on the shelves and a laptop was still humming gently on the cluttered desk. In short, it looked as though Jonathan was simply out of the room. If he had gone home, why did he leave all his things behind? And if he hadnt, where was he and why did the university records state that he had? Deeply concerned, I left the room and returned to my own. I lay awake in the darkness pondering the thoughts in my head and finally decided that I needed to find out what had happened and that I would do so alone...", "Spoonbill Village, Northernmost Quang Bin Province, SRVJune 29, 2011As the two young adults stared at each other, nothing but shock registered in either of their brains. Not the stares of the villagers nor of Josephs classmates affected them in their surprise. For Joseph, the shock was mixed with relief at finding his girlfriend safe, concern about his own impending fate as the main course and a strange confusion about what the heck was going on. For Marie, it was the sheer shock of actually seeing her boyfriend here and her puzzlement at the reason why that added to her numb bewilderment, not to mention the fear for his life at what might happen next.As the shock broke, she knew that she had to act. And since the village chief was here...\"You cannot sacrifice this man! His family are allies are of my parents, his parents are involved in our business. If anything happens to him, calamity will come upon us all!\" Demanding such things of the chieftain might have been rude, presumptuous and even insulting, but everything she said was the truth. If Joseph died, things would go down the toilet very quickly.Before the men could answer back, the crashing of a great bronze gong echoed over the crowd and all heads turned towards the source of the cacophony, the temple. Coming down the steps was a red lacquered palanquin with red curtains. Four men in deeply-hooded red robes supported the wooden structure, its bracing poles upon their shoulders. As they reached the courtyard proper, one of the warriors who had exited the large house went up to the palanquin, distinguished from the others by leather shoes on his feet, a broad circlet of gold around his black head-wrap and a single pheasant tail feather standing erect at the forefront of this headdress. Joseph could distinguish some sort of conversation happening, the words too quiet to make out. For several tense seconds he, Marie, his classmates and his professor waited for what would happen.What happened was that from this man, the villages hereditary chief, the order was given for them to be spared... for now. Another order was given to separate them and hold them in isolation until a final decision could be made.As Joseph was carried away into a side street, he could almost glimpse Marie following the palanquin into the Temple, including his Professor, still sitting in his basket.Several Hours LaterJoseph could never fully recall all of the things that he had pondered in those hours, sitting with his hands and feet bound, alone in that dark storehouse, smelling of rice and preserved vegetables. He had found Marie and as he had suspected for a number of years, she apparently belonged to a semi-unique culture of Vietic speakers in her purported homeland of the Annamite Range. What came as a surprise was that they apparently, if the few bits of coherent speech he had heard were any indication, practiced some sort of ritualized homicide and may well be inclined toward the consumption of \"long pork\"... and at the moment, that could include him.Eventually the door opened and soft, yellow light flooded the room, illuminating bags of rice and strings of hanging vegetables. In the doorway was Marie, carrying a paper covered lantern in one hand, a bronze bowl in the other and now hat-less. As he had briefly noticed earlier, the muscles on her limbs now had a definition to them that hadnt existed back in Glaston, her frame slightly more lean than the apprentice cook that he remembered. She was dressed just as she had been before, was still tattooed everywhere he could see and, as she she came over to where he was sitting, the light in the lantern seemed more like... fireflies than any kind of flame.\"So... nice place you have here.\" He hoped that starting slow could take some of the edge off the dangerous situation in which he now faced himself.\"Yeah... it is nice, I guess.\" Marie put the bowl (now seen to be carrying water) and the lantern on the ground beside him and knelt to untie his bonds. \"Im sorry that you got dragged into this. When I borrowed that record... I had no idea that...\" She closed her eyes and sighed in a way that, to Joseph, made the tattoos on her face dance almost... alluringly. \"Theres a lot that I just couldnt tell you when we were younger. My people are used to hiding... maybe tooused to it by now. I want to tell you so much, but I... I dont know where to begin.\"\"Then start from the beginning. That always seems to be how its done in the movies.\" Rubbing his wrists and ankles to get the circulation back, Joseph wondered just what he was going to hear.What he heard was everythingabout her people, the stories she had enraptured Cora with plus a whole lot of other stuff, fantastic and gruesome in equal measure. The human sacrifice, the ritual cannibalism, the intermittent persecution by Chinese, Champa, Viet and French over the last two thousand years... nothing was left out. As he sipped water from the bowl, she described how her peoples ancestors had been Au Lac refugees from the Red River Valley, driven south into the mountains by the invading Qin Chinese. On the edge of total starvation, they had been saved when a spirit animal, a black water buffalo cow with a seemingly endless number of calves trailing behind, had emerged from the highland jungle at the chanting of animist shamans travelling with the group.Behind those spectral buffalo had emerged their wonder and salvation: men in red robes with the legs of goats, monks from a far, high land called Leng. These strange people, who called themselves Shugoran, had taught this diverse group of farmers, mountain peoples, priests, urbanites and servants many useful magics: how to grow up to twelve crops of rice per year, how to draw water and metal from the earth, how to commune with the forces of the universe and not annoy them too severely, how to pass perfect memories from father to son, how to ensure the fertility of people, livestock and game and how to armor a persons skin so as to stop any blade or spear or arrow or sling stone.It was this last spell, combined with the requirement in orthodox Shugoran magic for Human (or similar) sacrifice and cannibalism that brought on the next mess. When the Qin Dynasty collapsed under the weight of the first emperors paranoia and his successors incompetence, suicide and the resultant power struggle, the men of the new \"Leng Viet\" decided to press their advantage. They launched a guerrilla campaign in an attempt to drive the Trieu Dynasty, with its mixed nobility of native southerners and Han Chinese, out of the Red River valley and establish a new native state.Over the next hundred years, men raided trade routes and army barracks in the guise of screaming, bare-chested, tattooed (associated with bandits and convicts by the Chinese) savages, dragging captives off into the night or the forest in order to sacrifice them for either civilian or military magic. When they eventually lost their \"War of the Bandits\" (from the threefold causes of not getting any local nobility on their side, of terrifying the pants off their Viet kinsmen with their ferocity and the rumours of their religion and by the sheer weight of the eventual re-invasion by the armies of the Han Dynasty) they fled deep into the mountains of the West and South, being chided by the last of the original, goat-legged sorcerers for their foolish, ill-planned ambitions. From then, they had remained hidden and relatively peaceful, though remembered in whispered folk-tales as vicious, man-eating monsters.After Marie had finished. Joseph sat in silence for a few minutes, digesting what he had just heard. The whole thing about magic was a bit.. hard to swallow. However, his own eyes had seen things that most would say were impossible. \"You dont... you dont hate me now, do you?\" Marie suddenly asked, her face awash in a worried panic, perhaps the culmination of every bout of anxiety she had ever experienced when Joseph had began edging onto the subject of her peoples true nature. So much worry, so much fear and one wrong move now could break her heart.For once, just once, he initiated the kiss this time.\"Does that answer your question?\" As they pulled apart, he could see that most of her anxieties had melted away. \"And... I hesitate to mention this, but about your parents restaurant...\" He stopped when he saw her face, now an annoyed, knowing grimace that indicated that the next words out of his mouth should be chosen very carefully. \"Uh... about the chicken, beef and pork they used. Was any of it... officiallysacrificed?\"Maries grimace let up. \"You need a priest to do anything official, and my parents are from farming families. Dont worry, we never served anyone up as the main course.\" She actually began to smile as she stood upright.\"Alright... but speaking of the main course, what about...\" Joseph gulped nervously. \"Me? Am I still going to be barbecue or did you actually convince anyone otherwise?\"The next news out of Maries mouth was welcome indeed. \"I didnt, but your professor won your life and those of the others after he talked with our Chief Priest. If Im right, he and the rest of your team should be at the house of my paternal grandparents. Who arethey, anyway?\"\"My classmates. The Anthropology department at Miskatonic organized this trip with Professor Andover and a couple of us volunteered. \" Still holding the bowl, Joseph began standing, his limbs still stiff and numb from hours of sitting. Despite this discomfort and the twitching shocks that came when blood began flowing free again, he followed her out the door, though not before taking and slinging a bag of rice over his shoulder at her asking, along with a braid of garlic bulbs and a small box of dried pork on a cord.During his captivity, Joseph had been held in one of the storehouses by the river, a short way north of the village. Now, in the waning light of dusk, he and Marie made their way back on the path that wove through vegetable gardens and pig-pens until they reached the outlying houses. Through narrow alleys between house stilts and below the sounds of evening meals being eaten, past dogs and pigs drowsing in the under-crofts and along the great outer wall of the temple they traveled before moving into the main square and down the main thoroughfare.\"It should be just after this next left, right across from the bronze-smith.\" As they walked along, they came to an intersection. On their right was a large house facing the street, belonging to the village bronze-smith and acting as a shop, a workplace and his family home. Across the main street from that house was a side street, lined by mostly smaller houses but each of them with soft lights in their windows. A few houses in, Marie led Joseph up the stairs of one house where familiar voices were laughing and making merry, including one brash female voice in particular that Joseph had come to know well.As Marie lay down the lantern on the porch and opened the door, the voices became louder and clearer. When they entered, everyone was already seated (or at least kneeling). Albert and Malone were trading stories of their brief imprisonment and what they had seen, while Tracy was working her way through a bowl of green tea, apparently trying to cajole her way into the rice whiskey. Professor Andover was making small conversation with an old village man sitting at the head of the table who was wearing the brown jacket and skirt combo that was so common. Also at the table was a younger man and his wife, maybe a little older than Maries parents, along with two teenage sons who had not yet received their tattooing. Some ways from the table, an elderly woman worked at a hearth lined with stone and brick, stoking a carefully controlled charcoal fire.Everyone looked up at the new arrivals. The first to speak was the old man who had been talking to the professor, telling Marie to bring the rice and other ingredients over to the charcoal hearth so the evening meal could begin and then for them to sit down. After that was done, Joseph noticed that people were looking at him.Apparently, it was time to make introductions.\"Joseph, Id like you to meet my family on my fathers side.\" After explaining that few of them could understand any English at all, Marie started introducing them. First came the old man, now identified as her paternal grandfather. Her grandmother, his wife, was the woman starting tending the fire at the hearth, her gray hair in an elaborate bun at the back of the head held together with a set of jade hairpins and wearing a long, black dress, similar to the garment that Marie had worn at the performance. Maries uncle Huy and his wife An sat across from the Miskatonic students and beside them sat Cuong and Thao, their two sons...Only two?\"Damn, the Kids!\" Marie had been so busy with her boyfriend that the absence her younger cousins had escaped her until now. She got back up and went to the door, opened it and called down the street for them to get in the house now and try not to spill the water they were carrying. As she returned to where she had been kneeling, many hurried footsteps were heard coming up the outside stairs and the door opened again as five children entered as a crowd. The oldest, a girl who was perhaps eleven years old, was carrying two bronze pails of water in her hands while the second oldest, a boy of maybe ten, was carrying two more.In fact, all the kids, which included two more boys and another girl, seemed to each be about a year apart down to a little boy of about seven years old. \"Big families the norm around here?\" Joseph asked his girlfriend as the water was transferred to cooking vessels and the ingredients collected.Marie shrugged. \"More or less: most farming families have at least three kids nowadays but the norm used to be around five around a century ago. This family is weird both ways: My uncle and aunt for having so many and my parents for just having me.\" Of course, sooner or later this casual reminiscing had to end. \"So, Professor...\" Tracy began, consciously deciding to get back on topic from the revery the two had been involved in. \"You Said that you had something to tell us, about the ultimate purpose of this expedition?\"Neville Andover smiled the way that someone delivering a great and terrible revelation does. \"As a matter of fact, I did.\" He motioned towards Malone, who was now extremely attentive. \"This is Malone Roberts; for the last year he has been playing the part of my student, but he is far more than that. He is my assistant, my cohort... my protege in the context of the agency I work for. Tell me...\" He seemed to direct this as every member of the audience (save Malone) who could speak English. \"Have any of you heard of Delta Green?\"\"Whats that? Something in the Marine Corps?\" It had soundedlike an innocent question from Ms. Williams, but Joseph had shared a class, study groups and cram sessions with her for many months, and could recognize the first signs of building stress and panic when he saw them. They were amazingly similar to the signs that Marie herself had shown, with the difference of gripping objects such as a table edge with white-knuckle intensity now apparent.\"Its surprising that you havent heard of it, considering the contacts in your community and the agencies reputation for... extreme measuresbefore 1960.\" Now Andover turned to Albert Noyes. \"Perhaps you have some notion of it... or its partner agency, Majestic 12. It is quite amazing work theyre doing on the Yuggoth Project, especially on fungi.\" This seemed like it was crammed with potential clues, but honestly, Joseph couldnt make heads or tails of it.Noyes, on the other hand, apparently could. He began smiling in surprise and recognition and began laughing at the revelation. \"You mean... you know about the Migo?\" Now Joseph was confused beyond all reckoning, and apparently so were Marie and Tracy.\"Know aboutthem, know some of them, occasionally work alongside them. And if I may say, for half-fungus, half-arthropod, telepathic pains in the rear, they are remarkably easy to work with.\" What followed was Albert explaining the situation: the weirdest kinds of aliens you could imagine had contacted some humans in the 1800s and hired them to assist in mining certain valuable minerals in the hills of Vermont and Maine. Over the years, the men and women in their employ had received advice from these aliens as to potential marriage partners, first in terms genetic compatibility and superior traits for their offspring, then based on attractiveness as their understanding of human reproductive psychology increased. Finally, as they realized the subtle psychological and social rules of courtship, the began acting as human elites once did, organizing parties for unattached men and women and subtly directing candidates certain ways as they piloted artificial human body-shells around the dance floor. It sounded weird... but reassuring, even humorous. Even Tracy seemed to lighten up... as far as a hunted rabbit couldlighten up.\"Mr. Clayton here is what you may call normal. However, he was privy to manifestations not usual of this Earth.\" Joseph then told the assembled of what he had witnessed, with Professor Andover hypothesizing that the phonograph may have projected images and smells by some means of eldritch energies. Marie also retold the story of her people and of the deal that she had agreed to to gain access to the phonograph: one year back in the village and receiving her tattoos of adulthood. Nothing more and nothing less had been asked of her.\"And finally, we have Ms. Williams, whose tale has much to do with the founding of the organization and its present form.\" Here, Andover seemed to realize what kind of anxiety the girl was going through, and thus went slowly. \"In the winter of 1928, the Miskatonic faculty was contacted by the United States Army to help investigate a series of strange attacks and abductions in Paige County, Virginia. As the base was in a primarily Quaker area, Miskatonic sent its lone member of faculty who was a Friend, one Hiriam Willows of Boston. While he remained among the Quaker farmfolk who knew the habits of the attacks, the army waged war against what was first believed to be a \"degenerate\" tribe of Iroquois but were later found to be white members of a strange fertility cult which engaged in human sacrifice.\"The academic glanced towards Tracy, who had lowered her head, closed her eyes and grimaced at what was surely to come. He turned back to his eager listeners. \"Before Willows left, he discovered strange objects in a secret room at the Longhouse Meeting Hall... objects which resembled those found on the slain cultists. He also, inadvertently, stumbled upon his hosts engaged in a ritual of apparent mourning, dressed as the Southern Iroquois would have been three hundred years ago, sacrificing pigs upon an altar at an isolated circle of standing stones, wailing and keening in grief.\" He looked back at Tracy. \"This was the experience which convinced him that not all who worship the base forces of the universe are driven to evil nor insanity. It was also the experience that not all things should be released to the world, both for the worlds safety and that of the subjects.\"After a moments silence, Tracy spoke. \"Excuse me.\" She got up walked out the door, somewhat to the surprise of her classmates, Marie and Maries family. Marie then got up and went to follow, an act which inevitably drew Joseph after her.They found Tracy sitting at the bottom of the steps, her chin on one balled fist, her other arm across her lap, her eyes staring into some unfathomable distance. Marie went forward first, sitting beside the girl as Joseph hung back. \"I dont think weve been introduced. My names Marie.\" When Tracy didnt answer. \"You know, you dont have to feel bad about what other people did. Those guys the Army killed werent your people, no matter how similar your rituals may have been.\"\"But they weremy people.\" The answer came suddenly and surprised both listeners.\"Pardon?\" Asked Joseph from the middle of the stairway.\"Those dangerous cultists that the professor told you about; they were English, Quakers even... or had been at one time.\" She sighed, not quite sure of herself on how to explain to outsiders the issue which had plagued her fears since the age of 10. \"They were my peoples kin, descendants of those of us who answered the Union armies call for guerrillas during the Civil War. Before that, wed adopted some sacrificial ritual from the Iroquois during the 1720s after some very hard winters. Where before theyd killed dogs, black deer and captured warriors... as well as captured women and children if it got reallybad... to get good crops and health, we imposed strict limits and rules. There was to be no more human sacrifice, we killed our own livestock and above all, we accept the rituals as a gift from on high... even if the whole Christ thing was supposed to render sacrifice obsolete.\"\"Id consider it a divine door prize. But about the Civil War?\" Marie was trying to make the talk as nonthreatening as possible, considering the darkness which had settled over the village.Getting back on topic, Tracy continued. \"Well, wed already been hiding escaped slaves for years on their way up to the major escape routes in Pennsylvania, but we felt that we couldnt do any more, especially with so much Confederate presence in the Shenandoah and the internecine aggression over secession. These people though... they wanted to do something. So, when a few Union officers wanted a meeting, they snuck off north. And when they came back, they brought otherthings with them. Old medieval codices which described Druidic rituals shockingly similar to our own but twisted and brutal, rituals which needed terror to be inflicted in the victims so that the full power of their life force could be drained. Their attitudes had changed as well; they became disdainful of the rest of the community: calling them weak, cowards, savages who refused to possess the full power of the Star Daughter and the Black Stag, fools who held onto their petty delusions of morality. Well, after they went and made a mess of everything by capturing and sacrificing a Confederate squadron... the rest of the Longhouse Quakers shunned them, bidding them to go into the high mountains until they were ready to return. And so, a collection of about 50 men, women and children left the Valley and went into the high woods.\"Joseph put something together in his head. \"And I take it that the next time they returned was 60 years later, crazier than ever.\"Tracy harrumphed. \"Youve got that right. And think about this while youre at it: by the 1920s, wed been isolated for so long that it was starting to show in our features; the more inbred we became, the leaner our faces and the bonier our joints. By the time Willows got there, we just looked skinny and somewhat malnourished and with the right connections a few decades later, that began to get fixed.\" Her face got hard. \"But what if Willows had finked on us, or Miskatonic sent one of their Congregationalist mamas boys instead? Do you realize what may have happened to us, especially in the 20s or 30s? Arresting us for a start, probably followed by forced sterilization and throwing us in crazy houses, sanitariums and prisons to rot. And thats just the adults!\"She was getting visibly angry. \"Their kids, my great-grandparents, would have been shuffled off to orphanages or perhaps boarding schools if they thought we were just really pale Indians.\" She shuddered. \"Ive read about the shit that happened in Canadas residential school system and it gave me just as many nightmares as the thought of my ancestors being hunted like wolves and tortured for things they never did or for who they were.\" She turned to look at Marie and for the first time since he knew her, Joseph could put a name (that name being \"very mildly inbred\") on the features which he had labeled as rural-attractive or cute in a farmers daughter kind of way. \"I know that your people have been hiding, but at least you guys made the mistake of acting like total jerks to get your reputation! We never did anything wrong.\"With that, Tracy got up, passed her companions and just as she was about to reenter the house, she paused and rethought something. \"Well, never did anything wrong besides burning down that chicken barn, but that was an emergency! Neither my aunt nor my little cousin would be here if not for that and besides...\" She turned her head to look at Joseph and Marie. \"They wrote it off as an electrical fire.\" As Tracy went back into the house, Joseph thought that, while going against all conventional reason, his life made perfect sense for the first time in a very long while."]}
{"id": "EN099", "pair": ["IV. A Mutation and a Madness1.In the week following that memorable Good Friday Charles Ward was seen more often than usual, and was continually carrying books between his library and the attic laboratory. His actions were quiet and rational, but he had a furtive, hunted look which his mother did not like, and developed an incredibly ravenous appetite as gauged by his demands upon the cook. Dr. Willett had been told of those Friday noises and happenings, and on the following Tuesday had a long conversation with the youth in the library where the picture stared no more. The interview was, as always, inconclusive; but Willett is still ready to swear that the youth was sane and himself at the time. He held out promises of an early revelation, and spoke of the need of securing a laboratory elsewhere. At the loss of the portrait he grieved singularly little considering his first enthusiasm over it, but seemed to find something of positive humour in its sudden crumbling.      About the second week Charles began to be absent from the house for long periods, and one day when good old black Hannah came to help with the spring cleaning she mentioned his frequent visits to the old house in Olney Court, where he would come with a large valise and perform curious delvings in the cellar. He was always very liberal to her and to old Asa, but seemed more worried than he used to be; which grieved her very much, since she had watched him grow up from birth. Another report of his doings came from Pawtuxet, where some friends of the family saw him at a distance a surprising number of times. He seemed to haunt the resort and canoe-house of Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet, and subsequent inquiries by Dr. Willett at that place brought out the fact that his purpose was always to secure access to the rather hedged-in river-bank, along which he would walk toward the north, usually not reappearing for a very long while.      Late in May came a momentary revival of ritualistic sounds in the attic laboratory which brought a stern reproof from Mr. Ward and a somewhat distracted promise of amendment from Charles. It occurred one morning, and seemed to form a resumption of the imaginary conversation noted on that turbulent Good Friday. The youth was arguing or remonstrating hotly with himself, for there suddenly burst forth a perfectly distinguishable series of clashing shouts in differentiated tones like alternate demands and denials which caused Mrs. Ward to run upstairs and listen at the door. She could hear no more than a fragment whose only plain words were \"must have it red for three months\", and upon her knocking all sounds ceased at once. When Charles was later questioned by his father he said that there were certain conflicts of spheres of consciousness which only great skill could avoid, but which he would try to transfer to other realms.      About the middle of June a queer nocturnal incident occurred. In the early evening there had been some noise and thumping in the laboratory upstairs, and Mr. Ward was on the point of investigating when it suddenly quieted down. That midnight, after the family had retired, the butler was nightlocking the front door when according to his statement Charles appeared somewhat blunderingly and uncertainly at the foot of the stairs with a large suitcase and made signs that he wished egress. The youth spoke no word, but the worthy Yorkshireman caught one sight of his fevered eyes and trembled causelessly. He opened the door and young Ward went out, but in the morning he presented his resignation to Mrs. Ward. There was, he said, something unholy in the glance Charles had fixed on him. It was no way for a young gentleman to look at an honest person, and he could not possibly stay another night. Mrs. Ward allowed the man to depart, but she did not value his statement highly. To fancy Charles in a savage state that night was quite ridiculous, for as long as she had remained awake she had heard faint sounds from the laboratory above; sounds as if of sobbing and pacing, and of a sighing which told only of despairs profoundest depths. Mrs. Ward had grown used to listening for sounds in the night, for the mystery of her son was fast driving all else from her mind.      The next evening, much as on another evening nearly three months before, Charles Ward seized the newspaper very early and accidentally lost the main section. The matter was not recalled till later, when Dr. Willett began checking up loose ends and searching out missing links here and there. In the Journal office he found the section which Charles had lost, and marked two items as of possible significance. They were as follows:More Cemetery DelvingIt was this morning discovered by Robert Hart, night watchman at the North Burial Ground, that ghouls were again at work in the ancient portion of the cemetery. The grave of Ezra Weeden, who was born in 1740 and died in 1824, according to his uprooted and savagely splintered slate headstone, was found excavated and rifled, the work being evidently done with a spade stolen from an adjacent tool-shed.      Whatever the contents may have been after more than a century of burial, all was gone except a few slivers of decayed wood. There were no wheel tracks, but the police have measured a single set of footprints which they found in the vicinity, and which indicate the boots of a man of refinement.      Hart is inclined to link this incident with the digging discovered last March, when a party in a motor truck were frightened away after making a deep excavation; but Sergt. Riley of the Second Station discounts this theory and points to vital differences in the two cases. In March the digging had been in a spot where no grave was known; but this time a well-marked and cared-for grave had been rifled with every evidence of deliberate purpose, and with a conscious malignity expressed in the splintering of the slab which had been intact up to the day before.      Members of the Weeden family, notified of the happening, expressed their astonishment and regret; and were wholly unable to think of any enemy who would care to violate the grave of their ancestor. Hazard Weeden of 598 Angell Street recalls a family legend according to which Ezra Weeden was involved in some very peculiar circumstances, not dishonourable to himself, shortly before the Revolution; but of any modern feud or mystery he is frankly ignorant. Inspector Cunningham has been assigned to the case, and hopes to uncover some valuable clues in the near future.Dogs Noisy in Pawtuxet      Residents of Pawtuxet were aroused about 3 a.m. today by a phenomenal baying of dogs which seemed to centre near the river just north of Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet. The volume and quality of the howling were unusually odd, according to most who heard it; and Fred Lemdin, night watchman at Rhodes, declares it was mixed with something very like the shrieks of a man in mortal terror and agony. A sharp and very brief thunderstorm, which seemed to strike somewhere near the bank of the river, put an end to the disturbance. Strange and unpleasant odours, probably from the oil tanks along the bay, are popularly linked with this incident; and may have had their share in exciting the dogs.      The aspect of Charles now became very haggard and hunted, and all agreed in retrospect that he may have wished at this period to make some statement or confession from which sheer terror withheld him. The morbid listening of his mother in the night brought out the fact that he made frequent sallies abroad under cover of darkness, and most of the more academic alienists unite at present in charging him with the revolting cases of vampirism which the press so sensationally reported about this time, but which have not yet been definitely traced to any known perpetrator. These cases, too recent and celebrated to need detailed mention, involved victims of every age and type and seemed to cluster around two distinct localities; the residential hill and the North End, near the Ward home, and the suburban districts across the Cranston line near Pawtuxet. Both late wayfarers and sleepers with open windows were attacked, and those who lived to tell the tale spoke unanimously of a lean, lithe, leaping monster with burning eyes which fastened its teeth in the throat or upper arm and feasted ravenously.      Dr. Willett, who refuses to date the madness of Charles Ward as far back as even this, is cautious in attempting to explain these horrors. He has, he declares, certain theories of his own; and limits his positive statements to a peculiar kind of negation. \"I will not,\" he says, \"state who or what I believe perpetrated these attacks and murders, but I will declare that Charles Ward was innocent of them. I have reason to be sure he was ignorant of the taste of blood, as indeed his continued anaemic decline and increasing pallor prove better than any verbal argument. Ward meddled with terrible things, but he has paid for it, and he was never a monster or a villain. As for now - I dont like to think. A change came, and Im content to believe that the old Charles Ward died with it. His soul did, anyhow, for that mad flesh that vanished from Waites hospital had another.\"      Willett speaks with authority, for he was often at the Ward home attending Mrs. Ward, whose nerves had begun to snap under the strain. Her nocturnal listening had bred some morbid hallucinations which she confided to the doctor with hesitancy, and which he ridiculed in talking to her, although they made him ponder deeply when alone. These delusions always concerned the faint sounds which she fancied she heard in the attic laboratory and bedroom, and emphasised the occurrence of muffled sighs and sobbings at the most impossible times. Early in July Willett ordered Mrs. Ward to Atlantic City for an indefinite recuperative sojourn, and cautioned both Mr. Ward and the haggard and elusive Charles to write her only cheering letters. It is probably to this enforced and reluctant escape that she owes her life and continued sanity.2.      Not long after his mothers departure Charles Ward began negotiating for the Pawtuxet bungalow. It was a squalid little wooden edifice with a concrete garage, perched high on the sparsely settled bank of the river slightly above Rhodes, but for some odd reason the youth would have nothing else. He gave the real-estate agencies no peace till one of them secured it for him at an exorbitant price from a somewhat reluctant owner, and as soon as it was vacant he took possession under cover of darkness, transporting in a great closed van the entire contents of his attic laboratory, including the books both weird and modern which he had borrowed from his study. He had this van loaded in the black small hours, and his father recalls only a drowsy realisation of stifled oaths and stamping feet on the night the goods were taken away. After that Charles moved back to his own old quarters on the third floor, and never haunted the attic again.      To the Pawtuxet bungalow Charles transferred all the secrecy with which he had surrounded his attic realm, save that he now appeared to have two sharers of his mysteries; a villainous-looking Portuguese half-caste from the South Main St. waterfront who acted as a servant, and a thin, scholarly stranger with dark glasses and a stubbly full beard of dyed aspect whose status was evidently that of a colleague. Neighbours vainly tried to engage these odd persons in conversation. The mulatto Gomes spoke very little English, and the bearded man, who gave his name as Dr. Allen, voluntarily followed his example. Ward himself tried to be more affable, but succeeded only in provoking curiosity with his rambling accounts of chemical research. Before long queer tales began to circulate regarding the all-night burning of lights; and somewhat later, after this burning had suddenly ceased, there rose still queerer tales of disproportionate orders of meat from the butchers and of the muffled shouting, declamation, rhythmic chanting, and screaming supposed to come from some very deep cellar below the place. Most distinctly the new and strange household was bitterly disliked by the honest bourgeoisie of the vicinity, and it is not remarkable that dark hints were advanced connecting the hated establishment with the current epidemic of vampiristic attacks and murders; especially since the radius of that plague seemed now confined wholly to Pawtuxet and the adjacent streets of Edgewood.      Ward spent most of his time at the bungalow, but slept occasionally at home and was still reckoned a dweller beneath his fathers roof. Twice he was absent from the city on week-long trips, whose destinations have not yet been discovered. He grew steadily paler and more emaciated even than before, and lacked some of his former assurance when repeating to Dr. Willett his old, old story of vital research and future revelations. Willett often waylaid him at his fathers house, for the elder Ward was deeply worried and perplexed, and wished his son to get as much sound oversight as could be managed in the case of so secretive and independent an adult. The doctor still insists that the youth was sane even as late as this, and adduces many a conversation to prove his point.      About September the vampirism declined, but in the following January Ward almost became involved in serious trouble. For some time the nocturnal arrival and departure of motor trucks at the Pawtuxet bungalow had been commented upon, and at this juncture an unforeseen hitch exposed the nature of at least one item of their contents. In a lonely spot near Hope Valley had occurred one of the frequent sordid waylayings of trucks by \"hi-jackers\" in quest of liquor shipments, but this time the robbers had been destined to receive the greater shock. For the long cases they seized proved upon opening to contain some exceedingly gruesome things; so gruesome, in fact, that the matter could not be kept quiet amongst the denizens of the underworld. The thieves had hastily buried what they discovered, but when the State Police got wind of the matter a careful search was made. A recently arrested vagrant, under promise of immunity from prosecution on any additional charge, at last consented to guide a party of troopers to the spot; and there was found in that hasty cache a very hideous and shameful thing. It would not be well for the national - or even the international - sense of decorum if the public were ever to know what was uncovered by that awestruck party. There was no mistaking it, even by these far from studious officers; and telegrams to Washington ensued with feverish rapidity.      The cases were addressed to Charles Ward at his Pawtuxet bungalow, and State and Federal officials at once paid him a very forceful and serious call. They found him pallid and worried with his two odd companions, and received from him what seemed to be a valid explanation and evidence of innocence. He had needed certain anatomical specimens as part of a programme of research whose depth and genuineness anyone who had known him in the last decade could prove, and had ordered the required kind and number from agencies which he had thought as reasonably legitimate as such things can be. Of the identity of the specimens he had known absolutely nothing, and was properly shocked when the inspectors hinted at the monstrous effect on public sentiment and national dignity which a knowledge of the matter would produce. In this statement he was firmly sustained by his bearded colleague Dr. Allen, whose oddly hollow voice carried even more conviction than his own nervous tones; so that in the end the officials took no action, but carefully set down the New York name and address which Ward gave them as a basis for a search which came to nothing. It is only fair to add that the specimens were quickly and quietly restored to their proper places, and that the general public will never know of their blasphemous disturbance.      On February 9, 1928, Dr. Willett received a letter from Charles Ward which he considers of extraordinary importance, and about which he has frequently quarrelled with Dr. Lyman. Lyman believes that this note contains positive proof of a well-developed case of dementia praecox, but Willett on the other hand regards it as the last perfectly sane utterance of the hapless youth. He calls especial attention to the normal character of the penmanship; which though shewing traces of shattered nerves, is nevertheless distinctly Wards own. The text in full is as follows:\"100 Prospect St.            Providence, R.I.,      February 8, 1928.\"Dear Dr. Willett: -       \"I feel that at last the time has come for me to make the disclosures which I have so long promised you, and for which you have pressed me so often. The patience you have shewn in waiting, and the confidence you have shewn in my mind and integrity, are things I shall never cease to appreciate.      \"And now that I am ready to speak, I must own with humiliation that no triumph such as I dreamed of can ever be mine. Instead of triumph I have found terror, and my talk with you will not be a boast of victory but a plea for help and advice in saving both myself and the world from a horror beyond all human conception or calculation. You recall what those Fenner letters said of the old raiding party at Pawtuxet. That must all be done again, and quickly. Upon us depends more than can be put into words - all civilisation, all natural law, perhaps even the fate of the solar system and the universe. I have brought to light a monstrous abnormality, but I did it for the sake of knowledge. Now for the sake of all life and Nature you must help me thrust it back into the dark again.      \"I have left that Pawtuxet place forever, and we must extirpate everything existing there, alive or dead. I shall not go there again, and you must not believe it if you ever hear that I am there. I will tell you why I say this when I see you. I have come home for good, and wish you would call on me at the very first moment that you can spare five or six hours continuously to hear what I have to say. It will take that long - and believe me when I tell you that you never had a more genuine professional duty than this. My life and reason are the very least things which hang in the balance.      \"I dare not tell my father, for he could not grasp the whole thing. But I have told him of my danger, and he has four men from a detective agency watching the house. I dont know how much good they can do, for they have against them forces which even you could scarcely envisage or acknowledge. So come quickly if you wish to see me alive and hear how you may help to save the cosmos from stark hell.      \"Any time will do - I shall not be out of the house. Dont telephone ahead, for there is no telling who or what may try to intercept you. And let us pray to whatever gods there be that nothing may prevent this meeting.      \"In utmost gravity and desperation,\"Charles Dexter Ward.\"      \"P.S. Shoot Dr. Allen on sight and dissolve his body in acid. Dont burn it.\"      Dr. Willett received this note about 10:30 a.m., and immediately arranged to spare the whole late afternoon and evening for the momentous talk, letting it extend on into the night as long as might be necessary. He planned to arrive about four oclock, and through all the intervening hours was so engulfed in every sort of wild speculation that most of his tasks were very mechanically performed. Maniacal as the letter would have sounded to a stranger, Willett had seen too much of Charles Wards oddities to dismiss it as sheer raving. That something very subtle, ancient, and horrible was hovering about he felt quite sure, and the reference to Dr. Allen could almost be comprehended in view of what Pawtuxet gossip said of Wards enigmatical colleague. Willett had never seen the man, but had heard much of his aspect and bearing, and could not but wonder what sort of eyes those much-discussed dark glasses might conceal.      Promptly at four Dr. Willett presented himself at the Ward residence, but found to his annoyance that Charles had not adhered to his determination to remain indoors. The guards were there, but said that the young man seemed to have lost part of his timidity. He had that morning done much apparently frightened arguing and protesting over the telephone, one of the detectives said, replying to some unknown voice with phrases such as \"I am very tired and must rest a while\", \"I cant receive anyone for some time, youll have to excuse me\", \"Please postpone decisive action till we can arrange some sort of compromise\", or \"I am very sorry, but I must take a complete vacation from everything; Ill talk with you later\". Then, apparently gaining boldness through meditation, he had slipped out so quietly that no one had seen him depart or knew that he had gone until he returned about one oclock and entered the house without a word. He had gone upstairs, where a bit of his fear must have surged back; for he was heard to cry out in a highly terrified fashion upon entering his library, afterward trailing off into a kind of choking gasp. When, however, the butler had gone to inquire what the trouble was, he had appeared at the door with a great show of boldness, and had silently gestured the man away in a manner that terrified him unaccountably. Then he had evidently done some rearranging of his shelves, for a great clattering and thumping and creaking ensued; after which he had reappeared and left at once. Willett inquired whether or not any message had been left, but was told that there was none. The butler seemed queerly disturbed about something in Charless appearance and manner, and asked solicitously if there was much hope for a cure of his disordered nerves.      For almost two hours Dr. Willett waited vainly in Charles Wards library, watching the dusty shelves with their wide gaps where books had been removed, and smiling grimly at the panelled overmantel on the north wall, whence a year before the suave features of old Joseph Curwen had looked mildly down. After a time the shadows began to gather, and the sunset cheer gave place to a vague growing terror which flew shadow-like before the night. Mr. Ward finally arrived, and shewed much surprise and anger at his sons absence after all the pains which had been taken to guard him. He had not known of Charless appointment, and promised to notify Willett when the youth returned. In bidding the doctor goodnight he expressed his utter perplexity at his sons condition, and urged his caller to do all he could to restore the boy to normal poise. Willett was glad to escape from that library, for something frightful and unholy seemed to haunt it; as if the vanished picture had left behind a legacy of evil. He had never liked that picture; and even now, strong-nerved though he was, there lurked a quality in its vacant panel which made him feel an urgent need to get out into the pure air as soon as possible.3.      The next morning Willett received a message from the senior Ward, saying that Charles was still absent. Mr. Ward mentioned that Dr. Allen had telephoned him to say that Charles would remain at Pawtuxet for some time, and that he must not be disturbed. This was necessary because Allen himself was suddenly called away for an indefinite period, leaving the researches in need of Charless constant oversight. Charles sent his best wishes, and regretted any bother his abrupt change of plans might have caused. In listening to this message Mr. Ward heard Dr. Allens voice for the first time, and it seemed to excite some vague and elusive memory which could not be actually placed, but which was disturbing to the point of fearfulness.      Faced by these baffling and contradictory reports, Dr. Willett was frankly at a loss what to do. The frantic earnestness of Charless note was not to be denied, yet what could one think of its writers immediate violation of his own expressed policy? Young Ward had written that his delvings had become blasphemous and menacing, that they and his bearded colleague must be extirpated at any cost, and that he himself would never return to their final scene; yet according to latest advices he had forgotten all this and was back in the thick of the mystery. Common sense bade one leave the youth alone with his freakishness, yet some deeper instinct would not permit the impression of that frenzied letter to subside. Willett read it over again, and could not make its essence sound as empty and insane as both its bombastic verbiage and its lack of fulfilment would seem to imply. Its terror was too profound and real, and in conjunction with what the doctor already knew evoked too vivid hints of monstrosities from beyond time and space to permit of any cynical explanation. There were nameless horrors abroad; and no matter how little one might be able to get at them, one ought to stand prepared for any sort of action at any time.      For over a week Dr. Willett pondered on the dilemma which seemed thrust upon him, and became more and more inclined to pay Charles a call at the Pawtuxet bungalow. No friend of the youth had ever ventured to storm this forbidden retreat, and even his father knew of its interior only from such descriptions as he chose to give; but Willett felt that some direct conversation with his patient was necessary. Mr. Ward had been receiving brief and non-committal typed notes from his son, and said that Mrs. Ward in her Atlantic City retirement had had no better word. So at length the doctor resolved to act; and despite a curious sensation inspired by old legends of Joseph Curwen, and by more recent revelations and warnings from Charles Ward, set boldly out for the bungalow on the bluff above the river.      Willett had visited the spot before through sheer curiosity, though of course never entering the house or proclaiming his presence; hence knew exactly the route to take. Driving out Broad Street one early afternoon toward the end of February in his small motor, he thought oddly of the grim party which had taken that selfsame road a hundred and fifty-seven years before on a terrible errand which none might ever comprehend.      The ride through the citys decaying fringe was short, and trim Edgewood and sleepy Pawtuxet presently spread out ahead. Willett turned to the right down Lockwood Street and drove his car as far along that rural road as he could, then alighted and walked north to where the bluff towered above the lovely bends of the river and the sweep of misty downlands beyond. Houses were still few here, and there was no mistaking the isolated bungalow with its concrete garage on a high point of land at his left. Stepping briskly up the neglected gravel walk he rapped at the door with a firm hand, and spoke without a tremor to the evil Portuguese mulatto who opened it to the width of a crack.      He must, he said, see Charles Ward at once on vitally important business. No excuse would be accepted, and a repulse would mean only a full report of the matter to the elder Ward. The mulatto still hesitated, and pushed against the door when Willett attempted to open it; but the doctor merely raised his voice and renewed his demands. Then there came from the dark interior a husky whisper which somehow chilled the hearer through and through though he did not know why he feared it. \"Let him in, Tony,\" it said, \"we may as well talk now as ever.\" But disturbing as was the whisper, the greater fear was that which immediately followed. The floor creaked and the speaker hove in sight - and the owner of those strange and resonant tones was seen to be no other than Charles Dexter Ward.      The minuteness with which Dr. Willett recalled and recorded his conversation of that afternoon is due to the importance he assigns to this particular period. For at last he concedes a vital change in Charles Dexter Wards mentality, and believes that the youth now spoke from a brain hopelessly alien to the brain whose growth he had watched for six and twenty years. Controversy with Dr. Lyman has compelled him to be very specific, and he definitely dates the madness of Charles Ward from the time the typewritten notes began to reach his parents. Those notes are not in Wards normal style; not even in the style of that last frantic letter to Willett. Instead, they are strange and archaic, as if the snapping of the writers mind had released a flood of tendencies and impressions picked up unconsciously through boyhood antiquarianism. There is an obvious effort to be modern, but the spirit and occasionally the language are those of the past.      The past, too, was evident in Wards every tone and gesture as he received the doctor in that shadowy bungalow. He bowed, motioned Willett to a seat, and began to speak abruptly in that strange whisper which he sought to explain at the very outset.      \"I am grown phthisical,\" he began, \"from this cursed river air. You must excuse my speech. I suppose you are come from my father to see what ails me, and I hope you will say nothing to alarm him.\"      Willett was studying these scraping tones with extreme care, but studying even more closely the face of the speaker. Something, he felt, was wrong; and he thought of what the family had told him about the fright of that Yorkshire butler one night. He wished it were not so dark, but did not request that any blind be opened. Instead, he merely asked Ward why he had so belied the frantic note of little more than a week before.      \"I was coming to that,\" the host replied. \"You must know, I am in a very bad state of nerves, and do and say queer things I cannot account for. As I have told you often, I am on the edge of great matters; and the bigness of them has a way of making me light-headed. Any man might well be frighted of what I have found, but I am not to be put off for long. I was a dunce to have that guard and stick at home; for having gone this far, my place is here. I am not well spoke of by my prying neighbours, and perhaps I was led by weakness to believe myself what they say of me. There is no evil to any in what I do, so long as I do it rightly. Have the goodness to wait six months, and Ill shew you what will pay your patience well.      \"You may as well know I have a way of learning old matters from things surer than books, and Ill leave you to judge the importance of what I can give to history, philosophy, and the arts by reason of the doors I have access to. My ancestor had all this when those witless peeping Toms came and murdered him. I now have it again, or am coming very imperfectly to have a part of it. This time nothing must happen, and least of all through any idiot fears of my own. Pray forget all I writ you, Sir, and have no fear of this place or any in it. Dr. Allen is a man of fine parts, and I owe him an apology for anything ill I have said of him. I wish I had no need to spare him, but there were things he had to do elsewhere. His zeal is equal to mine in all those matters, and I suppose that when I feared the work I feared him too as my greatest helper in it.\"      Ward paused, and the doctor hardly knew what to say or think. He felt almost foolish in the face of this calm repudiation of the letter; and yet there clung to him the fact that while the present discourse was strange and alien and indubitably mad, the note itself had been tragic in its naturalness and likeness to the Charles Ward he knew. Willett now tried to turn the talk on early matters, and recall to the youth some past events which would restore a familiar mood; but in this process he obtained only the most grotesque results. It was the same with all the alienists later on. Important sections of Charles Wards store of mental images, mainly those touching modern times and his own personal life, had been unaccountably expunged; whilst all the massed antiquarianism of his youth had welled up from some profound subconsciousness to engulf the contemporary and the individual. The youths intimate knowledge of elder things was abnormal and unholy, and he tried his best to hide it. When Willett would mention some favourite object of his boyhood archaistic studies he often shed by pure accident such a light as no normal mortal could conceivably be expected to possess, and the doctor shuddered as the glib allusion glided by.      It was not wholesome to know so much about the way the fat sheriffs wig fell off as he leaned over at the play in Mr. Douglass Histrionick Academy in King Street on the eleventh of February, 1762, which fell on a Thursday; or about how the actors cut the text of Steeles Conscious Lovers so badly that one was almost glad the Baptist-ridden legislature closed the theatre a fortnight later. That Thomas Sabins Boston coach was \"damnd uncomfortable\" old letters may well have told; but what healthy antiquarian could recall how the creaking of Epenetus Olneys new signboard (the gaudy crown he set up after he took to calling his tavern the Crown Coffee House) was exactly like the first few notes of the new jazz piece all the radios in Pawtuxet were playing?      Ward, however, would not be quizzed long in this vein. Modern and personal topics he waved aside quite summarily, whilst regarding antique affairs he soon shewed the plainest boredom. What he wished clearly enough was only to satisfy his visitor enough to make him depart without the intention of returning. To this end he offered to shew Willett the entire house, and at once proceeded to lead the doctor through every room from cellar to attic. Willett looked sharply, but noted that the visible books were far too few and trivial ever to have filled the wide gaps on Wards shelves at home, and that the meagre so-called \"laboratory\" was the flimsiest sort of a blind. Clearly there were a library and a laboratory elsewhere; but just where, it was impossible to say. Essentially defeated in his quest for something he could not name, Willett returned to town before evening and told the senior Ward everything which had occurred. They agreed that the youth must be definitely out of his mind, but decided that nothing drastic need be done just then. Above all, Mrs. Ward must be kept in as complete an ignorance as her sons own strange typed notes would permit.      Mr. Ward now determined to call in person upon his son, making it wholly a surprise visit. Dr. Willett took him in his car one evening, guiding him to within sight of the bungalow and waiting patiently for his return. The session was a long one, and the father emerged in a very saddened and perplexed state. His reception had developed much like Willetts, save that Charles had been an excessively long time in appearing after the visitor had forced his way into the hall and sent the Portuguese away with an imperative demand; and in the bearing of the altered son there was no trace of filial affection. The lights had been dim, yet even so the youth had complained that they dazzled him outrageously. He had not spoken out loud at all, averring that his throat was in very poor condition; but in his hoarse whisper there was a quality so vaguely disturbing that Mr. Ward could not banish it from his mind.      Now definitely leagued together to do all they could toward the youths mental salvation, Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett set about collecting every scrap of data which the case might afford. Pawtuxet gossip was the first item they studied, and this was relatively easy to glean since both had friends in that region. Dr. Willett obtained the most rumours because people talked more frankly to him than to a parent of the central figure, and from all he heard he could tell that young Wards life had become indeed a strange one. Common tongues would not dissociate his household from the vampirism of the previous summer, while the nocturnal comings and goings of the motor trucks provided their share of dark speculation. Local tradesmen spoke of the queerness of the orders brought them by the evil-looking mulatto, and in particular of the inordinate amounts of meat and fresh blood secured from the two butcher shops in the immediate neighbourhood. For a household of only three, these quantities were quite absurd.      Then there was the matter of the sounds beneath the earth. Reports of these things were harder to pin down, but all the vague hints tallied in certain basic essentials. Noises of a ritual nature positively existed, and at times when the bungalow was dark. They might, of course, have come from the known cellar; but rumour insisted that there were deeper and more spreading crypts. Recalling the ancient tales of Joseph Curwens catacombs, and assuming for granted that the present bungalow had been selected because of its situation on the old Curwen site as revealed in one or another of the documents found behind the picture, Willett and Mr. Ward gave this phase of the gossip much attention; and searched many times without success for the door in the river-bank which old manuscripts mentioned. As to popular opinions of the bungalows various inhabitants, it was soon plain that the Brava Portuguese was loathed, the bearded and spectacled Dr. Allen feared, and the pallid young scholar disliked to a profound extent. During the last week or two Ward had obviously changed much, abandoning his attempts at affability and speaking only in hoarse but oddly repellent whispers on the few occasions that he ventured forth.      Such were the shreds and fragments gathered here and there; and over these Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett held many long and serious conferences. They strove to exercise deduction, induction, and constructive imagination to their utmost extent; and to correlate every known fact of Charless later life, including the frantic letter which the doctor now shewed the father, with the meagre documentary evidence available concerning old Joseph Curwen. They would have given much for a glimpse of the papers Charles had found, for very clearly the key to the youths madness lay in what he had learned of the ancient wizard and his doings.4.      And yet, after all, it was from no step of Mr. Wards or Dr. Willetts that the next move in this singular case proceeded. The father and the physician, rebuffed and confused by a shadow too shapeless and intangible to combat, had rested uneasily on their oars while the typed notes of young Ward to his parents grew fewer and fewer. Then came the first of the month with its customary financial adjustments, and the clerks at certain banks began a peculiar shaking of heads and telephoning from one to the other. Officials who knew Charles Ward by sight went down to the bungalow to ask why every cheque of his appearing at this juncture was a clumsy forgery, and were reassurred less than they ought to have been when the youth hoarsely explained that his hand had lately been so much affected by a nervous shock as to make normal writing impossible. He could, he said, form no written characters at all except with great difficulty; and could prove it by the fact that he had been forced to type all his recent letters, even those to his father and mother, who would bear out the assertion.      What made the investigators pause in confusion was not this circumstance alone, for that was nothing unprecedented or fundamentally suspicious; nor even the Pawtuxet gossip, of which one or two of them had caught echoes. It was the muddled discourse of the young man which nonplussed them, implying as it did a virtually total loss of memory concerning important monetary matters which he had had at his fingertips only a month or two before. Something was wrong; for despite the apparent coherence and rationality of his speech, there could be no normal reason for this ill-concealed blankness on vital points. Moreover, although none of these men knew Ward well, they could not help observing the change in his language and manner. They had heard he was an antiquarian, but even the most hopeless antiquarians do not make daily use of obsolete phraseology and gestures. Altogether, this combination of hoarseness, palsied hands, bad memory, and altered speech and bearing must represent some disturbance or malady of genuine gravity, which no doubt formed the basis of the prevailing odd rumours; and after their departure the party of officials decided that a talk with the senior Ward was imperative.      So on the sixth of March, 1928, there was a long and serious conference in Mr. Wards office, after which the utterly bewildered father summoned Dr. Willett in a kind of helpless resignation. Willett looked over the strained and awkward signatures of the cheques, and compared them in his mind with the penmanship of that last frantic note. Certainly, the change was radical and profound, and yet there was something damnably familiar about the new writing. It had crabbed and archaic tendencies of a very curious sort, and seemed to result from a type of stroke utterly different from that which the youth had always used. It was strange - but where had he seen it before? On the whole, it was obvious that Charles was insane. Of that there could be no doubt. And since it appeared unlikely that he could handle his property or continue to deal with the outside world much longer, something must quickly be done toward his oversight and possible cure. It was then that the alienists were called in, Drs. Peck and Waite of Providence and Dr. Lyman of Boston, to whom Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett gave the most exhaustive possible history of the case, and who conferred at length in the now unused library of their young patient, examining what books and papers of his were left in order to gain some further notion of his habitual mental cast. After scanning this material and examining the ominous note to Willett they all agreed that Charles Wards studies had been enough to unseat or at least to warp any ordinary intellect, and wished most heartily that they could see his more intimate volumes and documents; but this latter they knew they could do, if at all, only after a scene at the bungalow itself. Willett now reviewed the whole case with febrile energy; it being at this time that he obtained the statements of the workmen who had seen Charles find the Curwen documents, and that he collated the incidents of the destroyed newspaper items, looking up the latter at the Journal office.      On Thursday, the eighth of March, Drs. Willett, Peck, Lyman, and Waite, accompanied by Mr. Ward, paid the youth their momentous call; making no concealment of their object and questioning the now acknowledged patient with extreme minuteness. Charles, though he was inordinately long in answering the summons and was still redolent of strange and noxious laboratory odours when he did finally make his agitated appearance, proved a far from recalcitrant subject; and admitted freely that his memory and balance had suffered somewhat from close application to abstruse studies. He offered no resistance when his removal to other quarters was insisted upon; and seemed, indeed, to display a high degree of intelligence as apart from mere memory. His conduct would have sent his interviewers away in bafflement had not the persistently archaic trend of his speech and unmistakable replacement of modern by ancient ideas in his consciousness marked him out as one definitely removed from the normal. Of his work he would say no more to the group of doctors than he had formerly said to his family and to Dr. Willett, and his frantic note of the previous month he dismissed as mere nerves and hysteria. He insisted that this shadowy bungalow possessed no library or laboratory beyond the visible ones, and waxed abstruse in explaining the absence from the house of such odours as now saturated all his clothing. Neighbourhood gossip he attributed to nothing more than the cheap inventiveness of baffled curiosity. Of the whereabouts of Dr. Allen he said he did not feel at liberty to speak definitely, but assured his inquisitors that the bearded and spectacled man would return when needed. In paying off the stolid Brava who resisted all questioning by the visitors, and in closing the bungalow which still seemed to hold such nighted secrets, Ward shewed no sign of nervousness save a barely noticed tendency to pause as though listening for something very faint. He was apparently animated by a calmly philosophic resignation, as if his removal were the merest transient incident which would cause the least trouble if facilitated and disposed of once and for all. It was clear that he trusted to his obviously unimpaired keenness of absolute mentality to overcome all the embarrassments into which his twisted memory, his lost voice and handwriting, and his secretive and eccentric behaviour had led him. His mother, it was agreed, was not to be told of the change; his father supplying typed notes in his name. Ward was taken to the restfully and picturesquely situated private hospital maintained by Dr. Waite on Conanicut Island in the bay, and subjected to the closest scrutiny and questioning by all the physicians connected with the case. It was then that the physical oddities were noticed; the slackened metabolism, the altered skin, and the disproportionate neural reactions. Dr. Willett was the most perturbed of the various examiners, for he had attended Ward all his life and could appreciate with terrible keenness the extent of his physical disorganisation. Even the familiar olive mark on his hip was gone, while on his chest was a great black mole or cicatrice which had never been there before, and which made Willett wonder whether the youth had ever submitted to any of the \"witch markings\" reputed to be inflicted at certain unwholesome nocturnal meetings in wild and lonely places. The doctor could not keep his mind off a certain transcribed witch-trial record from Salem which Charles had shewn him in the old non-secretive days, and which read: \"Mr. G. B. on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B.\" Wards face, too, troubled him horribly, till at length he suddenly discovered why he was horrified. For above the young mans right eye was something which he had never previously noticed - a small scar or pit precisely like that in the crumbled painting of old Joseph Curwen, and perhaps attesting some hideous ritualistic inoculation to which both had submitted at a certain stage of their occult careers.      While Ward himself was puzzling all the doctors at the hospital a very strict watch was kept on all mail addressed either to him or to Dr. Allen, which Mr. Ward had ordered delivered at the family home. Willett had predicted that very little would be found, since any communications of a vital nature would probably have been exchanged by messenger; but in the latter part of March there did come a letter from Prague for Dr. Allen which gave both the doctor and the father deep thought. It was in a very crabbed and archaic hand; and though clearly not the effort of a foreigner, shewed almost as singular a departure from modern English as the speech of young Ward himself. It read:Kleinstrasse 11,            Altstadt, Prague,      11th Feby. 1928.Brother in Almousin-Metraton: -       I this day receivd yr mention of what came up from the Salts I sent you. It was wrong, and meanes clearly that ye Headstones had been changd when Barnabas gott me the Specimen. It is often so, as you must be sensible of from the Thing you gott from ye Kings Chapell ground in 1769 and what H. gott from Olde Buryg Point in 1690, that was like to ende him. I gott such a Thing in Aegypt 75 yeares gone, from the which came that Scar ye Boy saw on me here in 1924. As I told you longe ago, do not calle up That which you can not put downe; either from dead Saltes or out of ye Spheres beyond. Have ye Wordes for laying at all times readie, and stopp not to be sure when there is any Doubte of Whom you have. Stones are all changd now in Nine groundes out of 10. You are never sure till you question. I this day heard from H., who has had Trouble with the Soldiers. He is like to be sorry Transylvania is passd from Hungary to Roumania, and woud change his Seat if the Castel werent so fulle of What we Knowe. But of this he hath doubtless writ you. In my next Sendg there will be Somewhat from a Hill tomb from ye East that will delight you greatly. Meanwhile forget not I am desirous of B. F. if you can possibly get him for me. You know G. in Philada. better than I. Have him up firste if you will, but doe not use him soe hard he will be Difficult, for I must speake to him in ye End.Yogg-Sothoth Neblod ZinSimon O.To Mr. J. C. inProvidence.      Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett paused in utter chaos before this apparent bit of unrelieved insanity. Only by degrees did they absorb what it seemed to imply. So the absent Dr. Allen, and not Charles Ward, had come to be the leading spirit at Pawtuxet? That must explain the wild reference and denunciation in the youths last frantic letter. And what of this addressing of the bearded and spectacled stranger as \"Mr. J. C.\"? There was no escaping the inference, but there are limits to possible monstrosity. Who was \"Simon O.\"; the old man Ward had visited in Prague four years previously? Perhaps, but in the centuries behind there had been another Simon O. - Simon Orne, alias Jedediah, of Salem, who vanished in 1771, and whose peculiar handwriting Dr. Willett now unmistakably recognised from the photostatic copies of the Orne formulae which Charles had once shewn him. What horrors and mysteries, what contradictions and contraventions of Nature, had come back after a century and a half to harass Old Providence with her clustered spires and domes?      The father and the old physician, virtually at a loss what to do or think, went to see Charles at the hospital and questioned him as delicately as they could about Dr. Allen, about the Prague visit, and about what he had learned of Simon or Jedediah Orne of Salem. To all these inquiries the youth was politely non-committal, merely barking in his hoarse whisper that he had found Dr. Allen to have a remarkable spiritual rapport with certain souls from the past, and that any correspondent the bearded man might have in Prague would probably be similarly gifted. When they left, Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett realised to their chagrin that they had really been the ones under catechism; and that without imparting anything vital himself, the confined youth had adroitly pumped them of everything the Prague letter had contained.      Drs. Peck, Waite, and Lyman were not inclined to attach much importance to the strange correspondence of young Wards companion; for they knew the tendency of kindred eccentrics and monomaniacs to band together, and believed that Charles or Allen had merely unearthed an expatriated counterpart - perhaps one who had seen Ornes handwriting and copied it in an attempt to pose as the bygone characters reincarnation. Allen himself was perhaps a similar case, and may have persuaded the youth into accepting him as an avatar of the long-dead Curwen. Such things had been known before, and on the same basis the hard-headed doctors disposed of Willetts growing disquiet about Charles Wards present handwriting, as studied from unpremeditated specimens obtained by various ruses. Willett thought he had placed its odd familiarity at last, and that what it vaguely resembled was the bygone penmanship of old Joseph Curwen himself; but this the other physicians regarded as a phase of imitativeness only to be expected in a mania of this sort, and refused to grant it any importance either favourable or unfavourable. Recognising this prosaic attitude in his colleagues, Willett advised Mr. Ward to keep to himself the letter which arrived for Dr. Allen on the second of April from Rakus, Transylvania, in a handwriting so intensely and fundamentally like that of the Hutchinson cipher that both father and physician paused in awe before breaking the seal. This read as follows:Castle Ferenczy      7 March 1928.Dear C.: - Hadd a Squad of 20 Militia up to talk about what the Country Folk say. Must digg deeper and have less Hearde.

But if Willett and Mr. Ward refrained from shewing this letter to the alienists, they did not refrain from acting upon it themselves. No amount of learned sophistry could controvert the fact that the strangely bearded and spectacled Dr. Allen, of whom Charless frantic letter had spoken as such a monstrous menace, was in close and sinister correspondence with two inexplicable creatures whom Ward had visited in his travels and who plainly claimed to be survivals or avatars of Curwens old Salem colleagues; that he was regarding himself as the reincarnation of Joseph Curwen, and that he entertained - or was at least advised to entertain - murderous designs against a \"boy\" who could scarcely be other than Charles Ward. There was organised horror afoot; and no matter who had started it, the missing Allen was by this time at the bottom of it. Therefore, thanking heaven that Charles was now safe in the hospital, Mr. Ward lost no time in engaging detectives to learn all they could of the cryptic bearded doctor; finding whence he had come and what Pawtuxet knew of him, and if possible discovering his current whereabouts. Supplying the men with one of the bungalow keys which Charles yielded up, he urged them to explore Allens vacant room which had been identified when the patients belongings had been packed; obtaining what clues they could from any effects he might have left about. Mr. Ward talked with the detectives in his sons old library, and they felt a marked relief when they left it at last; for there seemed to hover about the place a vague aura of evil. Perhaps it was what they had heard of the infamous old wizard whose picture had once stared from the panelled overmantel, and perhaps it was something different and irrelevant; but in any case they all half sensed an intangible miasma which centred in that carven vestige of an older dwelling and which at times almost rose to the intensity of a material emanation.", "VIII.In the meantime a quieter yet even more spiritually poignant phase of the horror had been blackly unwinding itself behind the closed door of a shelf-lined room in Arkham. The curious manuscript record or diary of Wilbur Whateley, delivered to Miskatonic University for translation, had caused much worry and bafflement among the experts in languages both ancient and modern; its very alphabet, notwithstanding a general resemblance to the heavily shaded Arabic used in Mesopotamia, being absolutely unknown to any available authority. The final conclusion of the linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet, giving the effect of a cipher; though none of the usual methods of cryptographic solution seemed to furnish any clue, even when applied on the basis of every tongue the writer might conceivably have used. The ancient books taken from Whateley’s quarters, while absorbingly interesting and in several cases promising to open up new and terrible lines of research among philosophers and men of science, were of no assistance whatever in this matter. One of them, a heavy tome with an iron clasp, was in another unknown alphabet—this one of a very different cast, and resembling Sanscrit more than anything else. The old ledger was at length given wholly into the charge of Dr. Armitage, both because of his peculiar interest in the Whateley matter, and because of his wide linguistic learning and skill in the mystical formulae of antiquity and the Middle Ages.      Armitage had an idea that the alphabet might be something esoterically used by certain forbidden cults which have come down from old times, and which have inherited many forms and traditions from the wizards of the Saracenic world. That question, however, he did not deem vital; since it would be unnecessary to know the origin of the symbols if, as he suspected, they were used as a cipher in a modern language. It was his belief that, considering the great amount of text involved, the writer would scarcely have wished the trouble of using another speech than his own, save perhaps in certain special formulae and incantations. Accordingly he attacked the manuscript with the preliminary assumption that the bulk of it was in English.      Dr. Armitage knew, from the repeated failures of his colleagues, that the riddle was a deep and complex one; and that no simple mode of solution could merit even a trial. All through late August he fortified himself with the massed lore of cryptography; drawing upon the fullest resources of his own library, and wading night after night amidst the arcana of Trithemius’ Poligraphia, Giambattista Porta’s De Furtivis Literarum Notis, De Vigenère’s Traité des Chiffres, Falconer’s Cryptomenysis Patefacta, Davys’ and Thicknesse’s eighteenth-century treatises, and such fairly modern authorities as Blair, von Marten, and Klüber’s Kryptographik. He interspersed his study of the books with attacks on the manuscript itself, and in time became convinced that he had to deal with one of those subtlest and most ingenious of cryptograms, in which many separate lists of corresponding letters are arranged like the multiplication table, and the message built up with arbitrary key-words known only to the initiated. The older authorities seemed rather more helpful than the newer ones, and Armitage concluded that the code of the manuscript was one of great antiquity, no doubt handed down through a long line of mystical experimenters. Several times he seemed near daylight, only to be set back by some unforeseen obstacle. Then, as September approached, the clouds began to clear. Certain letters, as used in certain parts of the manuscript, emerged definitely and unmistakably; and it became obvious that the text was indeed in English.      On the evening of September 2nd the last major barrier gave way, and Dr. Armitage read for the first time a continuous passage of Wilbur Whateley’s annals. It was in truth a diary, as all had thought; and it was couched in a style clearly shewing the mixed occult erudition and general illiteracy of the strange being who wrote it. Almost the first long passage that Armitage deciphered, an entry dated November 26, 1916, proved highly startling and disquieting. It was written, he remembered, by a child of three and a half who looked like a lad of twelve or thirteen.      “Today learned the Aklo for the Sabaoth,” it ran, “which did not like, it being answerable from the hill and not from the air. That upstairs more ahead of me than I had thought it would be, and is not like to have much earth brain. Shot Elam Hutchins’ collie Jack when he went to bite me, and Elam says he would kill me if he dast. I guess he won’t. Grandfather kept me saying the Dho formula last night, and I think I saw the inner city at the 2 magnetic poles. I shall go to those poles when the earth is cleared off, if I can’t break through with the Dho-Hna formula when I commit it. They from the air told me at Sabbat that it will be years before I can clear off the earth, and I guess grandfather will be dead then, so I shall have to learn all the angles of the planes and all the formulas between the Yr and the Nhhngr. They from outside will help, but they cannot take body without human blood. That upstairs looks it will have the right cast. I can see it a little when I make the Voorish sign or blow the powder of Ibn Ghazi at it, and it is near like them at May-Eve on the Hill. The other face may wear off some. I wonder how I shall look when the earth is cleared and there are no earth beings on it. He that came with the Aklo Sabaoth said I may be transfigured, there being much of outside to work on.”      Morning found Dr. Armitage in a cold sweat of terror and a frenzy of wakeful concentration. He had not left the manuscript all night, but sat at his table under the electric light turning page after page with shaking hands as fast as he could decipher the cryptic text. He had nervously telephoned his wife he would not be home, and when she brought him a breakfast from the house he could scarcely dispose of a mouthful. All that day he read on, now and then halted maddeningly as a reapplication of the complex key became necessary. Lunch and dinner were brought him, but he ate only the smallest fraction of either. Toward the middle of the next night he drowsed off in his chair, but soon woke out of a tangle of nightmares almost as hideous as the truths and menaces to man’s existence that he had uncovered.      On the morning of September 4th Professor Rice and Dr. Morgan insisted on seeing him for a while, and departed trembling and ashen-grey. That evening he went to bed, but slept only fitfully. Wednesday—the next day—he was back at the manuscript, and began to take copious notes both from the current sections and from those he had already deciphered. In the small hours of that night he slept a little in an easy-chair in his office, but was at the manuscript again before dawn. Some time before noon his physician, Dr. Hartwell, called to see him and insisted that he cease work. He refused; intimating that it was of the most vital importance for him to complete the reading of the diary, and promising an explanation in due course of time.      That evening, just as twilight fell, he finished his terrible perusal and sank back exhausted. His wife, bringing his dinner, found him in a half-comatose state; but he was conscious enough to warn her off with a sharp cry when he saw her eyes wander toward the notes he had taken. Weakly rising, he gathered up the scribbled papers and sealed them all in a great envelope, which he immediately placed in his inside coat pocket. He had sufficient strength to get home, but was so clearly in need of medical aid that Dr. Hartwell was summoned at once. As the doctor put him to bed he could only mutter over and over again, “But what, in God’s name, can we do?”      Dr. Armitage slept, but was partly delirious the next day. He made no explanations to Hartwell, but in his calmer moments spoke of the imperative need of a long conference with Rice and Morgan. His wilder wanderings were very startling indeed, including frantic appeals that something in a boarded-up farmhouse be destroyed, and fantastic references to some plan for the extirpation of the entire human race and all animal and vegetable life from the earth by some terrible elder race of beings from another dimension. He would shout that the world was in danger, since the Elder Things wished to strip it and drag it away from the solar system and cosmos of matter into some other plane or phase of entity from which it had once fallen, vigintillions of aeons ago. At other times he would call for the dreaded Necronomicon and the Daemonolatreia of Remigius, in which he seemed hopeful of finding some formula to check the peril he conjured up.      “Stop them, stop them!” he would shout. “Those Whateleys meant to let them in, and the worst of all is left! Tell Rice and Morgan we must do something—it’s a blind business, but I know how to make the powder. . . . It hasn’t been fed since the second of August, when Wilbur came here to his death, and at that rate. . . .”      But Armitage had a sound physique despite his seventy-three years, and slept off his disorder that night without developing any real fever. He woke late Friday, clear of head, though sober with a gnawing fear and tremendous sense of responsibility. Saturday afternoon he felt able to go over to the library and summon Rice and Morgan for a conference, and the rest of that day and evening the three men tortured their brains in the wildest speculation and the most desperate debate. Strange and terrible books were drawn voluminously from the stack shelves and from secure places of storage; and diagrams and formulae were copied with feverish haste and in bewildering abundance. Of scepticism there was none. All three had seen the body of Wilbur Whateley as it lay on the floor in a room of that very building, and after that not one of them could feel even slightly inclined to treat the diary as a madman’s raving.      Opinions were divided as to notifying the Massachusetts State Police, and the negative finally won. There were things involved which simply could not be believed by those who had not seen a sample, as indeed was made clear during certain subsequent investigations. Late at night the conference disbanded without having developed a definite plan, but all day Sunday Armitage was busy comparing formulae and mixing chemicals obtained from the college laboratory. The more he reflected on the hellish diary, the more he was inclined to doubt the efficacy of any material agent in stamping out the entity which Wilbur Whateley had left behind him—the earth-threatening entity which, unknown to him, was to burst forth in a few hours and become the memorable Dunwich horror.      Monday was a repetition of Sunday with Dr. Armitage, for the task in hand required an infinity of research and experiment. Further consultations of the monstrous diary brought about various changes of plan, and he knew that even in the end a large amount of uncertainty must remain. By Tuesday he had a definite line of action mapped out, and believed he would try a trip to Dunwich within a week. Then, on Wednesday, the great shock came. Tucked obscurely away in a corner of the Arkham Advertiser was a facetious little item from the Associated Press, telling what a record-breaking monster the bootleg whiskey of Dunwich had raised up. Armitage, half stunned, could only telephone for Rice and Morgan. Far into the night they discussed, and the next day was a whirlwind of preparation on the part of them all. Armitage knew he would be meddling with terrible powers, yet saw that there was no other way to annul the deeper and more malign meddling which others had done before him."]}
{"id": "EN038", "pair": ["III. A Search and an Evocation1.Charles Ward, as we have seen, first learned in 1918 of his descent from Joseph Curwen. That he at once took an intense interest in everything pertaining to the bygone mystery is not to be wondered at; for every vague rumour that he had heard of Curwen now became something vital to himself, in whom flowed Curwens blood. No spirited and imaginative genealogist could have done otherwise than begin forthwith an avid and systematic collection of Curwen data.      In his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at secrecy; so that even Dr. Lyman hesitates to date the youths madness from any period before the close of 1919. He talked freely with his family - though his mother was not particularly pleased to own an ancestor like Curwen - and with the officials of the various museums and libraries he visited. In applying to private families for records thought to be in their possession he made no concealment of his object, and shared the somewhat amused scepticism with which the accounts of the old diarists and letter-writers were regarded. He often expressed a keen wonder as to what really had taken place a century and a half before at that Pawtuxet farmhouse whose site he vainly tried to find, and what Joseph Curwen really had been.      When he came across the Smith diary and archives and encountered the letter from Jedediah Orne he decided to visit Salem and look up Curwens early activities and connexions there, which he did during the Easter vacation of 1919. At the Essex Institute, which was well known to him from former sojourns in the glamorous old town of crumbling Puritan gables and clustered gambrel roofs, he was very kindly received, and unearthed there a considerable amount of Curwen data. He found that his ancestor was born in Salem-Village, now Danvers, seven miles from town, on the eighteenth of February (O.S.) 1662-3; and that he had run away to sea at the age of fifteen, not appearing again for nine years, when he returned with the speech, dress, and manners of a native Englishman and settled in Salem proper. At that time he had little to do with his family, but spent most of his hours with the curious books he had brought from Europe, and the strange chemicals which came for him on ships from England, France, and Holland. Certain trips of his into the country were the objects of much local inquisitiveness, and were whisperingly associated with vague rumours of fires on the hills at night.      Curwens only close friends had been one Edward Hutchinson of Salem-Village and one Simon Orne of Salem. With these men he was often seen in conference about the Common, and visits among them were by no means infrequent. Hutchinson had a house well out toward the woods, and it was not altogether liked by sensitive people because of the sounds heard there at night. He was said to entertain strange visitors, and the lights seen from his windows were not always of the same colour. The knowledge he displayed concerning long-dead persons and long-forgotten events was considered distinctly unwholesome, and he disappeared about the time the witchcraft panic began, never to be heard from again. At that time Joseph Curwen also departed, but his settlement in Providence was soon learned of. Simon Orne lived in Salem until 1720, when his failure to grow visibly old began to excite attention. He thereafter disappeared, though thirty years later his precise counterpart and self-styled son turned up to claim his property. The claim was allowed on the strength of documents in Simon Ornes known hand, and Jedediah Orne continued to dwell in Salem till 1771, when certain letters from Providence citizens to the Rev. Thomas Barnard and others brought about his quiet removal to parts unknown.      Certain documents by and about all of these strange characters were available at the Essex Institute, the Court House, and the Registry of Deeds, and included both harmless commonplaces such as land titles and bills of sale, and furtive fragments of a more provocative nature. There were four or five unmistakable allusions to them on the witchcraft trial records; as when one Hepzibah Lawson swore on July 10, 1692, at the Court of Oyer and Terminer under Judge Hathorne, that fortie Witches and the Blacke Man were wont to meete in the Woodes behind Mr. Hutchinsons house, and one Amity How declared at a session of August 8th before Judge Gedney that Mr. G. B. (Rev. George Burroughs) on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B. Then there was a catalogue of Hutchinsons uncanny library as found after his disappearance, and an unfinished manuscript in his handwriting, couched in a cipher none could read. Ward had a photostatic copy of this manuscript made, and began to work casually on the cipher as soon as it was delivered to him. After the following August his labours on the cipher became intense and feverish, and there is reason to believe from his speech and conduct that he hit upon the key before October or November. He never stated, though, whether or not he had succeeded.      But of the greatest immediate interest was the Orne material. It took Ward only a short time to prove from identity of penmanship a thing he had already considered established from the text of the letter to Curwen; namely, that Simon Orne and his supposed son were one and the same person. As Orne had said to his correspondent, it was hardly safe to live too long in Salem, hence he resorted to a thirty-year sojourn abroad, and did not return to claim his lands except as a representative of a new generation. Orne had apparently been careful to destroy most of his correspondence, but the citizens who took action in 1771 found and preserved a few letters and papers which excited their wonder. There were cryptic formulae and diagrams in his and other hands which Ward now either copied with care or had photographed, and one extremely mysterious letter in a chirography that the searcher recognised from items in the Registry of Deeds as positively Joseph Curwens.      This Curwen letter, though undated as to the year, was evidently not the one in answer to which Orne had written the confiscated missive; and from internal evidence Ward placed it not much later than 1750. It may not be amiss to give the text in full, as a sample of the style of one whose history was so dark and terrible. The recipient is addressed as \"Simon\", but a line (whether drawn by Curwen or Orne Ward could not tell) is run through the word.Prouidence, I.

This letter, oddly enough, was what first gave Ward the exact location of Curwens Providence home; for none of the records encountered up to that time had been at all specific. The discovery was doubly striking because it indicated as the newer Curwen house built in 1761 on the site of the old, a dilapidated building still standing in Olney Court and well known to Ward in his antiquarian rambles over Stampers Hill. The place was indeed only a few squares from his own home on the great hills higher ground, and was now the abode of a negro family much esteemed for occasional washing, housecleaning, and furnace-tending services. To find, in distant Salem, such sudden proof of the significance of this familiar rookery in his own family history, was a highly impressive thing to Ward; and he resolved to explore the place immediately upon his return. The more mystical phases of the letter, which he took to be some extravagant kind of symbolism, frankly baffled him; though he noted with a thrill of curiosity that the Biblical passage referred to - Job 14, 14 - was the familiar verse, \"If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.\"2.      Young Ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement, and spent the following Saturday in a long and exhaustive study of the house in Olney Court. The place, now crumbling with age, had never been a mansion; but was a modest two-and-a-half story wooden town house of the familiar Providence colonial type, with plain peaked roof, large central chimney, and artistically carved doorway with rayed fanlight, triangular pediment, and trim Doric pilasters. It had suffered but little alteration externally, and Ward felt he was gazing on something very close to the sinister matters of his quest.      The present negro inhabitants were known to him, and he was very courteously shewn about the interior by old Asa and his stout wife Hannah. Here there was more change than the outside indicated, and Ward saw with regret that fully half of the fine scroll-and-urn overmantels and shell-carved cupboard linings were gone, whilst much of the fine wainscotting and bolection moulding was marked, hacked, and gouged, or covered up altogether with cheap wall-paper. In general, the survey did not yield as much as Ward had somehow expected; but it was at least exciting to stand within the ancestral walls which had housed such a man of horror as Joseph Curwen. He saw with a thrill that a monogram had been very carefully effaced from the ancient brass knocker.      From then until after the close of school Ward spent his time on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local Curwen data. The former still proved unyielding; but of the latter he obtained so much, and so many clues to similar data elsewhere, that he was ready by July to make a trip to New London and New York to consult old letters whose presence in those places was indicated. This trip was very fruitful, for it brought him the Fenner letters with their terrible description of the Pawtuxet farmhouse raid, and the Nightingale-Talbot letters in which he learned of the portrait painted on a panel of the Curwen library. This matter of the portrait interested him particularly, since he would have given much to know just what Joseph Curwen looked like; and he decided to make a second search of the house in Olney Court to see if there might not be some trace of the ancient features beneath peeling coats of later paint or layers of mouldy wall-paper.      Early in August that search took place, and Ward went carefully over the walls of every room sizeable enough to have been by any possibility the library of the evil builder. He paid especial attention to the large panels of such overmantels as still remained; and was keenly excited after about an hour, when on a broad area above the fireplace in a spacious ground-floor room he became certain that the surface brought out by the peeling of several coats of paint was sensibly darker than any ordinary interior paint or the wood beneath it was likely to have been. A few more careful tests with a thin knife, and he knew that he had come upon an oil portrait of great extent. With truly scholarly restraint the youth did not risk the damage which an immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture with the knife might have done, but just retired from the scene of his discovery to enlist expert help. In three days he returned with an artist of long experience, Mr. Walter C. Dwight, whose studio is near the foot of College Hill; and that accomplished restorer of paintings set to work at once with proper methods and chemical substances. Old Asa and his wife were duly excited over their strange visitors, and were properly reimbursed for this invasion of their domestic hearth.      As day by day the work of restoration progressed, Charles Ward looked on with growing interest at the lines and shades gradually unveiled after their long oblivion. Dwight had begun at the bottom; hence since the picture was a three-quarter-length one, the face did not come out for some time. It was meanwhile seen that the subject was a spare, well-shaped man with dark-blue coat, embroidered waistcoat, black satin small-clothes, and white silk stockings, seated in a carved chair against the background of a window with wharves and ships beyond. When the head came out it was observed to bear a neat Albemarle wig, and to possess a thin, calm, undistinguished face which seemed somehow familiar to both Ward and the artist. Only at the very last, though, did the restorer and his client begin to gasp with astonishment at the details of that lean, pallid visage, and to recognise with a touch of awe the dramatic trick which heredity had played. For it took the final bath of oil and the final stroke of the delicate scraper to bring out fully the expression which centuries had hidden; and to confront the bewildered Charles Dexter Ward, dweller in the past, with his own living features in the countenance of his horrible great-great-great-grandfather.      Ward brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered, and his father at once determined to purchase the picture despite its execution on stationary panelling. The resemblance to the boy, despite an appearance of rather greater age, was marvellous; and it could be seen that through some trick of atavism the physical contours of Joseph Curwen had found precise duplication after a century and a half. Mrs. Wards resemblance to her ancestor was not at all marked, though she could recall relatives who had some of the facial characteristics shared by her son and by the bygone Curwen. She did not relish the discovery, and told her husband that he had better burn the picture instead of bringing it home. There was, she averred, something unwholesome about it; not only intrinsically, but in its very resemblance to Charles. Mr. Ward, however, was a practical man of power and affairs - a cotton manufacturer with extensive mills at Riverpoint in the Pawtuxet Valley - and not one to listen to feminine scruples. The picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to his son, and he believed the boy deserved it as a present. In this opinion, it is needless to say, Charles most heartily concurred; and a few days later Mr. Ward located the owner of the house - a small rodent-featured person with a guttural accent - and obtained the whole mantel and overmantel bearing the picture at a curtly fixed priced which cut short the impending torrent of unctuous haggling.      It now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the Ward home, where provisions were made for its thorough restoration and installation with an electric mock-fireplace in Charless third-floor study or library. To Charles was left the task of superintending this removal, and on the twenty-eighth of August he accompanied two expert workmen from the Crooker decorating firm to the house in Olney Court, where the mantel and portrait-bearing overmantel were detached with great care and precision for transportation in the companys motor truck. There was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the chimneys course, and in this young Ward observed a cubical recess about a foot square, which must have lain directly behind the head of the portrait. Curious as to what such a space might mean or contain, the youth approached and looked within; finding beneath the deep coatings of dust and soot some loose yellowed papers, a crude, thick copybook, and a few mouldering textile shreds which may have formed the ribbon binding the rest together. Blowing away the bulk of the dirt and cinders, he took up the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover. It was in a hand which he had learned to recognise at the Essex Institute, and proclaimed the volume as the \"Journall and Notes of Jos: Curwen, Gent., of Providence-Plantations, Late of Salem.\"      Excited beyond measure by his discovery, Ward shewed the book to the two curious workmen beside him. Their testimony is absolute as to the nature and genuineness of the finding, and Dr. Willett relies on them to help establish his theory that the youth was not mad when he began his major eccentricities. All the other papers were likewise in Curwens handwriting, and one of them seemed especially portentous because of its inscription: \"To Him Who Shal Come After, & How He May Gett Beyonde Time & ye Spheres.\" Another was in a cipher; the same, Ward hoped, as the Hutchinson cipher which had hitherto baffled him. A third, and here the searcher rejoiced, seemed to be a key to the cipher; whilst the fourth and fifth were addressed respectively to \"Edw: Hutchinson, Armiger\" and \"Jedediah Orne, Esq.\", or Their Heir or Heirs, or Those Representg Them. The sixth and last was inscribed: \"Joseph Curwen his Life and Travells Betn ye yeares 1678 and 1687: Of Whither He Voyagd, Where He Stayd, Whom He Sawe, and What He Learnt.\"3.      We have now reached the point from which the more academic school of alienists date Charles Wards madness. Upon his discovery the youth had looked immediately at a few of the inner pages of the book and manuscripts, and had evidently seen something which impressed him tremendously. Indeed, in shewing the titles to the workmen he appeared to guard the text itself with peculiar care, and to labour under a perturbation for which even the antiquarian and genealogical significance of the find could hardly account. Upon returning home he broke the news with an almost embarrassed air, as if he wished to convey an idea of its supreme importance without having to exhibit the evidence itself. He did not even shew the titles to his parents, but simply told them that he had found some documents in Joseph Curwens handwriting, \"mostly in cipher\", which would have to be studied very carefully before yielding up their true meaning. It is unlikely that he would have shewn what he did to the workmen, had it not been for their unconcealed curiosity. As it was he doubtless wished to avoid any display of peculiar reticence which would increase their discussion of the matter.      That night Charles Ward sat up in his room reading the new-found book and papers, and when day came he did not desist. His meals, on his urgent request when his mother called to see what was amiss, were sent up to him; and in the afternoon he appeared only briefly when the men came to install the Curwen picture and mantelpiece in his study. The next night he slept in snatches in his clothes, meanwhile wrestling feverishly with the unravelling of the cipher manuscript. In the morning his mother saw that he was at work on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher, which he had frequently shewn her before; but in response to her query he said that the Curwen key could not be applied to it. That afternoon he abandoned his work and watched the men fascinatedly as they finished their installation of the picture with its woodwork above a cleverly realistic electric log, setting the mock-fireplace and overmantel a little out from the north wall as if a chimney existed, and boxing in the sides with panelling to match the rooms. The front panel holding the picture was sawn and hinged to allow cupboard space behind it. After the workmen went he moved his work into the study and sat down before it with his eyes half on the cipher and half on the portrait which stared back at him like a year-adding and century-recalling mirror.      His parents, subsequently recalling his conduct at this period, give interesting details anent the policy of concealment which he practiced. Before servants he seldom hid any paper which he might be studying, since he rightly assumed that Curwens intricate and archaic chirography would be too much for them. With his parents, however, he was more circumspect; and unless the manuscript in question were a cipher, or a mere mass of cryptic symbols and unknown ideographs (as that entitled \"To Him Who Shal Come After etc.\" seemed to be), he would cover it with some convenient paper until his caller had departed. At night he kept the papers under lock and key in an antique cabinet of his, where he also placed them whenever he left the room. He soon resumed fairly regular hours and habits, except that his long walks and other outside interests seemed to cease. The opening of school, where he now began his senior year, seemed a great bore to him; and he frequently asserted his determination never to bother with college. He had, he said, important special investigations to make, which would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and the humanities than any university which the world could boast.      Naturally, only one who had always been more or less studious, eccentric, and solitary could have pursued this course for many days without attracting notice. Ward, however, was constitutionally a scholar and a hermit; hence his parents were less surprised than regretful at the close confinement and secrecy he adopted. At the same time, both his father and mother thought it odd that he would shew them no scrap of his treasure-trove, nor give any connected account of such data as he had deciphered. This reticence he explained away as due to a wish to wait until he might announce some connected revelation, but as the weeks passed without further disclosures there began to grow up between the youth and his family a kind of constraint; intensified in his mothers case by her manifest disapproval of all Curwen delvings.      During October Ward began visiting the libraries again, but no longer for the antiquarian matter of his former days. Witchcraft and magic, occultism and daemonology, were what he sought now; and when Providence sources proved unfruitful he would take the train for Boston and tap the wealth of the great library in Copley Square, the Widener Library at Harvard, or the Zion Research Library in Brookline, where certain rare works on Biblical subjects are available. He bought extensively, and fitted up a whole additional set of shelves in his study for newly acquired works on uncanny subjects; while during the Christmas holidays he made a round of out-of-town trips including one to Salem to consult certain records at the Essex Institute.      About the middle of January, 1920, there entered Wards bearing an element of triumph which he did not explain, and he was no more found at work upon the Hutchinson cipher. Instead, he inaugurated a dual policy of chemical research and record-scanning; fitting up for the one a laboratory in the unused attic of the house, and for the latter haunting all the sources of vital statistics in Providence. Local dealers in drugs and scientific supplies, later questioned, gave astonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and instruments he purchased; but clerks at the State House, the City Hall, and the various libraries agree as to the definite object of his second interest. He was searching intensely and feverishly for the grave of Joseph Curwen, from whose slate slab an older generation had so wisely blotted the name.      Little by little there grew upon the Ward family the conviction that something was wrong. Charles had had freaks and changes of minor interests before, but this growing secrecy and absorption in strange pursuits was unlike even him. His school work was the merest pretence; and although he failed in no test, it could be seen that the old application had all vanished. He had other concernments now; and when not in his new laboratory with a score of obsolete alchemical books, could be found either poring over old burial records down town or glued to his volumes of occult lore in his study, where the startlingly - one almost fancied increasingly - similar features of Joseph Curwen stared blandly at him from the great overmantel on the north wall.      Late in March Ward added to his archive-searching a ghoulish series of rambles about the various ancient cemeteries of the city. The cause appeared later, when it was learned from City Hall clerks that he had probably found an important clue. His quest had suddenly shifted from the grave of Joseph Curwen to that of one Naphthali Field; and this shift was explained when, upon going over the files that he had been over, the investigators actually found a fragmentary record of Curwens burial which had escaped the general obliteration, and which stated that the curious leaden coffin had been interred \"10 ft. S. and 5 ft. W. of Naphthali Fields grave in ye - \". The lack of a specified burying-ground in the surviving entry greatly complicated the search, and Naphthali Fields grave seemed as elusive as that of Curwen; but here no systematic effacement had existed, and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on the stone itself even if its record had perished. Hence the rambles - from which St. Johns (the former Kings) Churchyard and the ancient Congregational burying-ground in the midst of Swan Point Cemetery were excluded, since other statistics had shewn that the only Naphthali Field (obiit 1729) whose grave could have been meant had been a Baptist.4.      It was toward May when Dr. Willett, at the request of the senior Ward, and fortified with all the Curwen data which the family had gleaned from Charles in his non-secretive days, talked with the young man. The interview was of little value or conclusiveness, for Willett felt at every moment that Charles was thoroughly master of himself and in touch with matters of real importance; but it at least forced the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanour. Of a pallid, impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment, Ward seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits, though not to reveal their object. He stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early scientific knowledge, for the most part in cipher, of an apparent scope comparable only to the discoveries of Friar Bacon and perhaps surpassing even those. They were, however, meaningless except when correlated with a body of learning now wholly obsolete; so that their immediate presentation to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all impressiveness and dramatic significance. To take their vivid place in the history of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of which they evolved, and to this task of correlation Ward was now devoting himself. He was seeking to acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of the Curwen data must possess, and hoped in time to make a full announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to the world of thought. Not even Einstein, he declared, could more profoundly revolutionise the current conception of things.      As to his graveyard search, whose object he freely admitted, but the details of whose progress he did not relate, he said he had reason to think that Joseph Curwens mutilated headstone bore certain mystic symbols - carved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by those who had effaced the name - which were absolutely essential to the final solution of his cryptic system. Curwen, he believed, had wished to guard his secret with care; and had consequently distributed the data in an exceedingly curious fashion. When Dr. Willett asked to see the mystic documents, Ward displayed much reluctance and tried to put him off with such things as photostatic copies of the Hutchinson cipher and Orne formulae and diagrams; but finally shewed him the exteriors of some of the real Curwen finds - the \"Journall and Notes\", the cipher (title in cipher also), and the formula-filled message \"To Him Who Shal Come After\" - and let him glance inside such as were in obscure characters.      He also opened the diary at a page carefully selected for its innocuousness and gave Willett a glimpse of Curwens connected handwriting in English. The doctor noted very closely the crabbed and complicated letters, and the general aura of the seventeenth century which clung round both penmanship and style despite the writers survival into the eighteenth century, and became quickly certain that the document was genuine. The text itself was relatively trivial, and Willett recalled only a fragment:\"Wedn. 16 Octr. 1754. My Sloope the Wakeful this Day putt in from London with XX newe Men pickd up in ye Indies, Spaniards from Martineco and 2 Dutch Men from Surinam.

Simon hath not Writ these V. Weekes, but I expecte soon hearg from him.\"      When upon reaching this point Dr. Willett turned the leaf he was quickly checked by Ward, who almost snatched the book from his grasp. All that the doctor had a chance to see on the newly opened page was a brief pair of sentences; but these, strangely enough, lingered tenaciously in his memory. They ran: \"Ye Verse from Liber-Damnatus beg spoke V Roodmasses and IV Hallows-Eves, I am Hopeful ye Thing is breedg Outside ye Spheres. It will drawe One who is to Come, if I can make sure he shal bee, and he shall think on Past thinges and look back thro all ye yeares, against ye which I must have ready ye Saltes or That to make em with.\"      Willett saw no more, but somehow this small glimpse gave a new and vague terror to the painted features of Joseph Curwen which stared blandly down from the overmantel. Ever after that he entertained the odd fancy - which his medical skill of course assured him was only a fancy - that the eyes of the portrait had a sort of wish, if not an actual tendency, to follow young Charles Ward as he moved about the room. He stopped before leaving to study the picture closely, marvelling at its resemblance to Charles and memorising every minute detail of the cryptical, colourless face, even down to a slight scar or pit in the smooth brow above the right eye. Cosmo Alexander, he decided, was a painter worthy of the Scotland that produced Raeburn, and a teacher worthy of his illustrious pupil Gilbert Stuart.      Assured by the doctor that Charless mental health was in no danger, but that on the other hand he was engaged in researches which might prove of real importance, the Wards were more lenient than they might otherwise have been when during the following June the youth made positive his refusal to attend college. He had, he declared, studies of much more vital importance to pursue; and intimated a wish to go abroad the following year in order to avail himself of certain sources of data not existing in America. The senior Ward, while denying this latter wish as absurd for a boy of only eighteen, acquiesced regarding the university; so that after a none too brilliant graduation from the Moses Brown School there ensued for Charles a three-year period of intensive occult study and graveyard searching. He became recognised as an eccentric, and dropped even more completely from the sight of his familys friends than he had been before; keeping close to his work and only occasionally making trips to other cities to consult obscure records. Once he went south to talk with a strange old mulatto who dwelt in a swamp and about whom a newspaper had printed a curious article. Again he sought a small village in the Adirondacks whence reports of certain odd ceremonial practices had come. But still his parents forbade him the trip to the Old World which he desired.      Coming of age in April, 1923, and having previously inherited a small competence from his maternal grandfather, Ward determined at last to take the European trip hitherto denied him. Of his proposed itinerary he would say nothing save that the needs of his studies would carry him to many places, but he promised to write his parents fully and faithfully. When they saw he could not be dissuaded, they ceased all opposition and helped as best they could; so that in June the young man sailed for Liverpool with the farewell blessings of his father and mother, who accompanied him to Boston and waved him out of sight from the White Star pier in Charlestown. Letters soon told of his safe arrival, and of his securing good quarters in Great Russell Street, London; where he proposed to stay, shunning all family friends, till he had exhausted the resources of the British Museum in a certain direction. Of his daily life he wrote but little, for there was little to write. Study and experiment consumed all his time, and he mentioned a laboratory which he had established in one of his rooms. That he said nothing of antiquarian rambles in the glamorous old city with its luring skyline of ancient domes and steeples and its tangles of roads and alleys whose mystic convolutions and sudden vistas alternately beckon and surprise, was taken by his parents as a good index of the degree to which his new interests had engrossed his mind.      In June, 1924, a brief note told of his departure for Paris, to which he had before made one or two flying trips for material in the Bibliothque Nationale. For three months thereafter he sent only postal cards, giving an address in the Rue St. Jacques and referring to a special search among rare manuscripts in the library of an unnamed private collector. He avoided acquaintances, and no tourists brought back reports of having seen him. Then came a silence, and in October the Wards received a picture card from Prague, Czecho-Slovakia, stating that Charles was in that ancient town for the purpose of conferring with a certain very aged man supposed to be the last living possessor of some very curious mediaeval information. He gave an address in the Neustadt, and announced no move till the following January; when he dropped several cards from Vienna telling of his passage through that city on the way toward a more easterly region whither one of his correspondents and fellow-delvers into the occult had invited him.      The next card was from Klausenburg in Transylvania, and told of Wards progress toward his destination. He was going to visit a Baron Ferenczy, whose estate lay in the mountains east of Rakus; and was to be addressed at Rakus in the care of that nobleman. Another card from Rakus a week later, saying that his hosts carriage had met him and that he was leaving the village for the mountains, was his last message for a considerable time; indeed, he did not reply to his parents frequent letters until May, when he wrote to discourage the plan of his mother for a meeting in London, Paris, or Rome during the summer, when the elder Wards were planning to travel in Europe. His researches, he said, were such that he could not leave his present quarters; while the situation of Baron Ferenczys castle did not favour visits. It was on a crag in the dark wooded mountains, and the region was so shunned by the country folk that normal people could not help feeling ill at ease. Moreover, the Baron was not a person likely to appeal to correct and conservative New England gentlefolk. His aspect and manners had idiosyncrasies, and his age was so great as to be disquieting. It would be better, Charles said, if his parents would wait for his return to Providence; which could scarcely be far distant.      That return did not, however, take place until May, 1926, when after a few heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into New York on the Homeric and traversed the long miles to Providence by motor-coach, eagerly drinking in the green rolling hills, the fragrant, blossoming orchards, and the white steepled towns of vernal Connecticut; his first taste of ancient New England in nearly four years. When the coach crossed the Pawcatuck and entered Rhode Island amidst the faery goldenness of a late spring afternoon his heart beat with quickened force, and the entry to Providence along Reservoir and Elmwood avenues was a breathless and wonderful thing despite the depths of forbidden lore to which he had delved. At the high square where Broad, Weybosset, and Empire Streets join, he saw before and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant, remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town; and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down the terminal behind the Biltmore, bringing into view the great dome and soft, roof-pierced greenery of the ancient hill across the river, and the tall colonial spire of the First Baptist Church limned pink in the magic evening light against the fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous background.      Old Providence! It was this place and the mysterious forces of its long, continuous history which had brought him into being, and which had drawn him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no prophet might fix. Here lay the arcana, wondrous or dreadful as the case might be, for which all his years of travel and application had been preparing him. A taxicab whirled him through Post Office Square with its glimpse of the river, the old Market House, and the head of the bay, and up the steep curved slope of Waterman Street to Prospect, where the vast gleaming dome and sunset-flushed Ionic columns of the Christian Science Church beckoned northward. Then eight squares past the fine old estates his childish eyes had known, and the quaint brick sidewalks so often trodden by his youthful feet. And at last the little white overtaken farmhouse on the right, on the left the classic Adam porch and stately bayed facade of the great brick house where he was born. It was twilight, and Charles Dexter Ward had come home.5.      A school of alienists slightly less academic than Dr. Lymans assign to Wards European trip the beginning of his true madness. Admitting that he was sane when he started, they believe that his conduct upon returning implies a disastrous change. But even to this claim Dr. Willett refuses to accede. There was, he insists, something later; and the queernesses of the youth at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroad - odd enough things, to be sure, but by no means implying mental aberration on the part of their celebrant. Ward himself, though visibly aged and hardened, was still normal in his general reactions; and in several talks with Willett displayed a balance which no madman - even an incipient one - could feign continuously for long. What elicited the notion of insanity at this period were the sounds heard at all hours from Wards attic laboratory, in which he kept himself most of the time. There were chantings and repetitions, and thunderous declamations in uncanny rhythms; and although these sounds were always in Wards own voice, there was something in the quality of that voice, and in the accents of the formulae it pronounced, which could not but chill the blood of every hearer. It was noticed that Nig, the venerable and beloved black cat of the household, bristled and arched his back perceptibly when certain of the tones were heard.      The odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise exceedingly strange. Sometimes they were very noxious, but more often they were aromatic, with a haunting, elusive quality which seemed to have the power of inducing fantastic images. People who smelled them had a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas, with strange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite distance. Ward did not resume his old-time rambles, but applied himself diligently to the strange books he had brought home, and to equally strange delvings within his quarters; explaining that European sources had greatly enlarged the possibilities of his work, and promising great revelations in the years to come. His older aspect increased to a startling degree his resemblance to the Curwen portrait in his library; and Dr. Willett would often pause by the latter after a call, marvelling at the virtual identity, and reflecting that only the small pit above the pictures right eye now remained to differentiate the long-dead wizard from the living youth. These calls of Willetts, undertaken at the request of the senior Wards, were curious affairs. Ward at no time repulsed the doctor, but the latter saw that he could never reach the young mans inner psychology. Frequently he noted peculiar things about; little wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables, and the half-erased remnants of circles, triangles, and pentagrams in chalk or charcoal on the cleared central space of the large room. And always in the night those rhythms and incantations thundered, till it became very difficult to keep servants or suppress furtive talk of Charless madness.      In January, 1927, a peculiar incident occurred. One night about midnight, as Charles was chanting a ritual whose weird cadence echoed unpleasantly through the house below, there came a sudden gust of chill wind from the bay, and a faint, obscure trembling of the earth which everyone in the neighbourhood noted. At the same time the cat exhibited phenomenal traces of fright, while dogs bayed for as much as a mile around. This was the prelude to a sharp thunderstorm, anomalous for the season, which brought with it such a crash that Mr. and Mrs. Ward believed the house had been struck. They rushed upstairs to see what damage had been done, but Charles met them at the door to the attic; pale, resolute, and portentous, with an almost fearsome combination of triumph and seriousness on his face. He assured them that the house had not really been struck, and that the storm would soon be over. They paused, and looking through a window saw that he was indeed right; for the lightning flashed farther and farther off, whilst the trees ceased to bend in the strange frigid gust from the water. The thunder sank to a sort of dull mumbling chuckle and finally died away. Stars came out, and the stamp of triumph on Charles Wards face crystallised into a very singular expression.      For two months or more after this incident Ward was less confined than usual to his laboratory. He exhibited a curious interest in the weather, and made odd inquiries about the date of the spring thawing of the ground. One night late in March he left the house after midnight, and did not return till almost morning; when his mother, being wakeful, heard a rumbling motor draw up to the carriage entrance. Muffled oaths could be distinguished, and Mrs. Ward, rising and going to the window, saw four dark figures removing a long, heavy box from a truck at Charless direction and carrying it within by the side door. She heard laboured breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs, and finally a dull thumping in the attic; after which the footfalls descended again, and the four men reappeared outside and drove off in their truck.      The next day Charles resumed his strict attic seclusion, drawing down the dark shades of his laboratory windows and appearing to be working on some metal substance. He would open the door to no one, and steadfastly refused all proffered food. About noon a wrenching sound followed by a terrible cry and a fall were heard, but when Mrs. Ward rapped at the door her son at length answered faintly, and told her that nothing had gone amiss. The hideous and indescribable stench now welling out was absolutely harmless and unfortunately necessary. Solitude was the one prime essential, and he would appear later for dinner. That afternoon, after the conclusion of some odd hissing sounds which came from behind the locked portal, he did finally appear; wearing an extremely haggard aspect and forbidding anyone to enter the laboratory upon any pretext. This, indeed, proved the beginning of a new policy of secrecy; for never afterward was any other person permitted to visit either the mysterious garret workroom or the adjacent storeroom which he cleaned out, furnished roughly, and added to his inviolably private domain as a sleeping apartment. Here he lived, with books brought up from his library beneath, till the time he purchased the Pawtuxet bungalow and moved to it all his scientific effects.      In the evening Charles secured the paper before the rest of the family and damaged part of it through an apparent accident. Later on Dr. Willett, having fixed the date from statements by various members of the household, looked up an intact copy at the Journal office and found that in the destroyed section the following small item had occurred:Nocturnal Diggers Surprised inNorth Burial GroundRobert Hart, night watchman at the North Burial Ground, this morning discovered a party of several men with a motor truck in the oldest part of the cemetery, but apparently frightened them off before they had accomplished whatever their object may have been.      The discovery took place at about four oclock, when Harts attention was attracted by the sound of a motor outside his shelter. Investigating, he saw a large truck on the main drive several rods away; but could not reach it before the sound of his feet on the gravel had revealed his approach. The men hastily placed a large box in the truck and drove away toward the street before they could be overtaken; and since no known grave was disturbed, Hart believes that this box was an object which they wished to bury.      The diggers must have been at work for a long while before detection, for Hart found an enormous hole dug at a considerable distance back from the roadway in the lot of Amasa Field, where most of the old stones have long ago disappeared. The hole, a place as large and deep as a grave, was empty; and did not coincide with any interment mentioned in the cemetery records.      Sergt. Riley of the Second Station viewed the spot and gave the opinion that the hole was dug by bootleggers rather gruesomely and ingeniously seeking a safe cache for liquor in a place not likely to be disturbed. In reply to questions Hart said he thought the escaping truck had headed up Rochambeau Avenue, though he could not be sure.      During the next few days Ward was seldom seen by his family. Having added sleeping quarters to his attic realm, he kept closely to himself there, ordering food brought to the door and not taking it in until after the servant had gone away. The droning of monotonous formulae and the chanting of bizarre rhythms recurred at intervals, while at other times occasional listeners could detect the sound of tinkling glass, hissing chemicals, running water, or roaring gas flames. Odours of the most unplaceable quality, wholly unlike any before noted, hung at times around the door; and the air of tension observable in the young recluse whenever he did venture briefly forth was such as to excite the keenest speculation. Once he made a hasty trip to the Athenaeum for a book he required, and again he hired a messenger to fetch him a highly obscure volume from Boston. Suspense was written portentously over the whole situation, and both the family and Dr. Willett confessed themselves wholly at a loss what to do or think about it.6.      Then on the fifteenth of April a strange development occurred. While nothing appeared to grow different in kind, there was certainly a very terrible difference in degree; and Dr. Willett somehow attaches great significance to the change. The day was Good Friday, a circumstance of which the servants made much, but which others quite naturally dismiss as an irrelevant coincidence. Late in the afternoon young Ward began repeating a certain formula in a singularly loud voice, at the same time burning some substance so pungent that its fumes escaped over the entire house. The formula was so plainly audible in the hall outside the locked door that Mrs. Ward could not help memorising it as she waited and listened anxiously, and later on she was able to write it down at Dr. Willetts request. It ran as follows, and experts have told Dr. Willett that its very close analogue can be found in the mystic writings of \"Eliphas Levi\", that cryptic soul who crept through a crack in the forbidden door and glimpsed the frightful vistas of the void beyond:\"Per Adonai Eloim, Adonai Jehova,Adonai Sabaoth, Metraton On Agla Mathon,verbum pythonicum, mysterium salamandrae,conventus sylvorum, antra gnomorum,daemonia Coeli Gad, Almousin, Gibor, Jehosua,Evam, Zariatnatmik, veni, veni, veni.\"      This had been going on for two hours without change or intermission when over all the neighbourhood a pandaemoniac howling of dogs set in. The extent of this howling can be judged from the space it received in the papers the next day, but to those in the Ward household it was overshadowed by the odour which instantly followed it; a hideous, all-pervasive odour which none of them had ever smelt before or have ever smelt since. In the midst of this mephitic flood there came a very perceptible flash like that of lightning, which would have been blinding and impressive but for the daylight around; and then was heard the voice that no listener can ever forget because of its thunderous remoteness, its incredible depth, and its eldritch dissimilarity to Charles Wards voice. It shook the house, and was clearly heard by at least two neighbours above the howling of the dogs. Mrs. Ward, who had been listening in despair outside her sons locked laboratory, shivered as she recognised its hellish import; for Charles had told her of its evil fame in dark books, and of the manner in which it had thundered, according to the Fenner letters, above the doomed Pawtuxet farmhouse on the night of Joseph Curwens annihilation. There was no mistaking that nightmare phrase, for Charles had described it too vividly in the old days when he had talked frankly of his Curwen investigations. And yet it was only this fragment of an archaic and forgotten language: \"DIES MIES JESCHET BOENE DOESEF DOUVEMA ENITEMAUS\".      Close upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening of the daylight, though sunset was still an hour distant, and then a puff of added odour different from the first but equally unknown and intolerable. Charles was chanting again now and his mother could hear syllables that sounded like \"Yi-nash-Yog-Sothoth-he-lgeb-fi-throdog\" - ending in a \"Yah!\" whose maniacal force mounted in an ear-splitting crescendo. A second later all previous memories were effaced by the wailing scream which burst out with frantic explosiveness and gradually changed form to a paroxysm of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Mrs. Ward, with the mingled fear and blind courage of maternity, advanced and knocked affrightedly at the concealing panels, but obtained no sign of recognition. She knocked again, but paused nervelessly as a second shriek arose, this one unmistakably in the familiar voice of her son, and sounding concurrently with the still bursting cachinnations of that other voice. Presently she fainted, although she is still unable to recall the precise and immediate cause. Memory sometimes makes merciful deletions.      Mr. Ward returned from the business section at about quarter past six; and not finding his wife downstairs, was told by the frightened servants that she was probably watching at Charless door, from which the sounds had been far stranger than ever before. Mounting the stairs at once, he saw Mrs. Ward stretched at full length on the floor of the corridor outside the laboratory; and realising that she had fainted, hastened to fetch a glass of water from a set bowl in a neighbouring alcove. Dashing the cold fluid in her face, he was heartened to observe an immediate response on her part, and was watching the bewildered opening of her eyes when a chill shot through him and threatened to reduce him to the very state from which she was emerging. For the seemingly silent laboratory was not as silent as it had appeared to be, but held the murmurs of a tense, muffled conversation in tones too low for comprehension, yet of a quality profoundly disturbing to the soul.      It was not, of course, new for Charles to mutter formulae; but this muttering was definitely different. It was so palpably a dialogue, or imitation of a dialogue, with the regular alteration of inflections suggesting question and answer, statement and response. One voice was undisguisedly that of Charles, but the other had a depth and hollowness which the youths best powers of ceremonial mimicry had scarcely approached before. There was something hideous, blasphemous, and abnormal about it, and but for a cry from his recovering wife which cleared his mind by arousing his protective instincts it is not likely that Theodore Howland Ward could have maintained for nearly a year more his old boast that he had never fainted. As it was, he seized his wife in his arms and bore her quickly downstairs before she could notice the voices which had so horribly disturbed him. Even so, however, he was not quick enough to escape catching something himself which caused him to stagger dangerously with his burden. For Mrs. Wards cry had evidently been heard by others than he, and there had come from behind the locked door the first distinguishable words which that masked and terrible colloquy had yielded. They were merely an excited caution in Charless own voice, but somehow their implications held a nameless fright for the father who overheard them. The phrase was just this: \"Sshh! - write!\"      Mr. and Mrs. Ward conferred at some length after dinner, and the former resolved to have a firm and serious talk with Charles that very night. No matter how important the object, such conduct could no longer be permitted; for these latest developments transcended every limit of sanity and formed a menace to the order and nervous well-being of the entire household. The youth must indeed have taken complete leave of his senses, since only downright madness could have prompted the wild screams and imaginary conversations in assumed voices which the present day had brought forth. All this must be stopped, or Mrs. Ward would be made ill and the keeping of servants become an impossibility.      Mr. Ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for Charless laboratory. On the third floor, however, he paused at the sounds which he heard proceeding from the now disused library of his son. Books were apparently being flung about and papers wildly rustled, and upon stepping to the door Mr. Ward beheld the youth within, excitedly assembling a vast armful of literary matter of every size and shape. Charless aspect was very drawn and haggard, and he dropped his entire load with a start at the sound of his fathers voice. At the elder mans command he sat down, and for some time listened to the admonitions he had so long deserved. There was no scene. At the end of the lecture he agreed that his father was right, and that his noises, mutterings, incantations, and chemical odours were indeed inexcusable nuisances. He agreed to a policy of greater quiet, though insisting on a prolongation of his extreme privacy. Much of his future work, he said, was in any case purely book research; and he could obtain quarters elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be necessary at a later stage. For the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed the keenest contrition, and explained that the conversation later heard was part of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental atmosphere. His use of abstruse technical terms somewhat bewildered Mr. Ward, but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and poise despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity. The interview was really quite inconclusive, and as Charles picked up his armful and left the room Mr. Ward hardly knew what to make of the entire business. It was as mysterious as the death of poor old Nig, whose stiffening form had been found an hour before in the basement, with staring eyes and fear-distorted mouth.      Driven by some vague detective instinct, the bewildered parent now glanced curiously at the vacant shelves to see what his son had taken up to the attic. The youths library was plainly and rigidly classified, so that one might tell at a glance the books or at least the kind of books which had been withdrawn. On this occasion Mr. Ward was astonished to find that nothing of the occult or the antiquarian, beyond what had been previously removed, was missing. These new withdrawals were all modern items; histories, scientific treatises, geographies, manuals of literature, philosophic works, and certain contemporary newspapers and magazines. It was a very curious shift from Charles Wards recent run of reading, and the father paused in a growing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense of strangeness. The strangeness was a very poignant sensation, and almost clawed at his chest as he strove to see just what was wrong around him. Something was indeed wrong, and tangibly as well as spiritually so. Ever since he had been in this room he had known that something was amiss, and at last it dawned upon him what it was.      On the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the house in Olney Court, but to the cracked and precariously restored oils of the large Curwen portrait disaster had come. Time and unequal heating had done their work at last, and at some time since the rooms last cleaning the worst had happened. Peeling clear of the wood, curling tighter and tighter, and finally crumbling into small bits with what must have been malignly silent suddenness, the portrait of Joseph Curwen had resigned forever its staring surveillance of the youth it so strangely resembled, and now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust.", "VIII.In the meantime a quieter yet even more spiritually poignant phase of the horror had been blackly unwinding itself behind the closed door of a shelf-lined room in Arkham. The curious manuscript record or diary of Wilbur Whateley, delivered to Miskatonic University for translation, had caused much worry and bafflement among the experts in languages both ancient and modern; its very alphabet, notwithstanding a general resemblance to the heavily shaded Arabic used in Mesopotamia, being absolutely unknown to any available authority. The final conclusion of the linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet, giving the effect of a cipher; though none of the usual methods of cryptographic solution seemed to furnish any clue, even when applied on the basis of every tongue the writer might conceivably have used. The ancient books taken from Whateley’s quarters, while absorbingly interesting and in several cases promising to open up new and terrible lines of research among philosophers and men of science, were of no assistance whatever in this matter. One of them, a heavy tome with an iron clasp, was in another unknown alphabet—this one of a very different cast, and resembling Sanscrit more than anything else. The old ledger was at length given wholly into the charge of Dr. Armitage, both because of his peculiar interest in the Whateley matter, and because of his wide linguistic learning and skill in the mystical formulae of antiquity and the Middle Ages.      Armitage had an idea that the alphabet might be something esoterically used by certain forbidden cults which have come down from old times, and which have inherited many forms and traditions from the wizards of the Saracenic world. That question, however, he did not deem vital; since it would be unnecessary to know the origin of the symbols if, as he suspected, they were used as a cipher in a modern language. It was his belief that, considering the great amount of text involved, the writer would scarcely have wished the trouble of using another speech than his own, save perhaps in certain special formulae and incantations. Accordingly he attacked the manuscript with the preliminary assumption that the bulk of it was in English.      Dr. Armitage knew, from the repeated failures of his colleagues, that the riddle was a deep and complex one; and that no simple mode of solution could merit even a trial. All through late August he fortified himself with the massed lore of cryptography; drawing upon the fullest resources of his own library, and wading night after night amidst the arcana of Trithemius’ Poligraphia, Giambattista Porta’s De Furtivis Literarum Notis, De Vigenère’s Traité des Chiffres, Falconer’s Cryptomenysis Patefacta, Davys’ and Thicknesse’s eighteenth-century treatises, and such fairly modern authorities as Blair, von Marten, and Klüber’s Kryptographik. He interspersed his study of the books with attacks on the manuscript itself, and in time became convinced that he had to deal with one of those subtlest and most ingenious of cryptograms, in which many separate lists of corresponding letters are arranged like the multiplication table, and the message built up with arbitrary key-words known only to the initiated. The older authorities seemed rather more helpful than the newer ones, and Armitage concluded that the code of the manuscript was one of great antiquity, no doubt handed down through a long line of mystical experimenters. Several times he seemed near daylight, only to be set back by some unforeseen obstacle. Then, as September approached, the clouds began to clear. Certain letters, as used in certain parts of the manuscript, emerged definitely and unmistakably; and it became obvious that the text was indeed in English.      On the evening of September 2nd the last major barrier gave way, and Dr. Armitage read for the first time a continuous passage of Wilbur Whateley’s annals. It was in truth a diary, as all had thought; and it was couched in a style clearly shewing the mixed occult erudition and general illiteracy of the strange being who wrote it. Almost the first long passage that Armitage deciphered, an entry dated November 26, 1916, proved highly startling and disquieting. It was written, he remembered, by a child of three and a half who looked like a lad of twelve or thirteen.      “Today learned the Aklo for the Sabaoth,” it ran, “which did not like, it being answerable from the hill and not from the air. That upstairs more ahead of me than I had thought it would be, and is not like to have much earth brain. Shot Elam Hutchins’ collie Jack when he went to bite me, and Elam says he would kill me if he dast. I guess he won’t. Grandfather kept me saying the Dho formula last night, and I think I saw the inner city at the 2 magnetic poles. I shall go to those poles when the earth is cleared off, if I can’t break through with the Dho-Hna formula when I commit it. They from the air told me at Sabbat that it will be years before I can clear off the earth, and I guess grandfather will be dead then, so I shall have to learn all the angles of the planes and all the formulas between the Yr and the Nhhngr. They from outside will help, but they cannot take body without human blood. That upstairs looks it will have the right cast. I can see it a little when I make the Voorish sign or blow the powder of Ibn Ghazi at it, and it is near like them at May-Eve on the Hill. The other face may wear off some. I wonder how I shall look when the earth is cleared and there are no earth beings on it. He that came with the Aklo Sabaoth said I may be transfigured, there being much of outside to work on.”      Morning found Dr. Armitage in a cold sweat of terror and a frenzy of wakeful concentration. He had not left the manuscript all night, but sat at his table under the electric light turning page after page with shaking hands as fast as he could decipher the cryptic text. He had nervously telephoned his wife he would not be home, and when she brought him a breakfast from the house he could scarcely dispose of a mouthful. All that day he read on, now and then halted maddeningly as a reapplication of the complex key became necessary. Lunch and dinner were brought him, but he ate only the smallest fraction of either. Toward the middle of the next night he drowsed off in his chair, but soon woke out of a tangle of nightmares almost as hideous as the truths and menaces to man’s existence that he had uncovered.      On the morning of September 4th Professor Rice and Dr. Morgan insisted on seeing him for a while, and departed trembling and ashen-grey. That evening he went to bed, but slept only fitfully. Wednesday—the next day—he was back at the manuscript, and began to take copious notes both from the current sections and from those he had already deciphered. In the small hours of that night he slept a little in an easy-chair in his office, but was at the manuscript again before dawn. Some time before noon his physician, Dr. Hartwell, called to see him and insisted that he cease work. He refused; intimating that it was of the most vital importance for him to complete the reading of the diary, and promising an explanation in due course of time.      That evening, just as twilight fell, he finished his terrible perusal and sank back exhausted. His wife, bringing his dinner, found him in a half-comatose state; but he was conscious enough to warn her off with a sharp cry when he saw her eyes wander toward the notes he had taken. Weakly rising, he gathered up the scribbled papers and sealed them all in a great envelope, which he immediately placed in his inside coat pocket. He had sufficient strength to get home, but was so clearly in need of medical aid that Dr. Hartwell was summoned at once. As the doctor put him to bed he could only mutter over and over again, “But what, in God’s name, can we do?”      Dr. Armitage slept, but was partly delirious the next day. He made no explanations to Hartwell, but in his calmer moments spoke of the imperative need of a long conference with Rice and Morgan. His wilder wanderings were very startling indeed, including frantic appeals that something in a boarded-up farmhouse be destroyed, and fantastic references to some plan for the extirpation of the entire human race and all animal and vegetable life from the earth by some terrible elder race of beings from another dimension. He would shout that the world was in danger, since the Elder Things wished to strip it and drag it away from the solar system and cosmos of matter into some other plane or phase of entity from which it had once fallen, vigintillions of aeons ago. At other times he would call for the dreaded Necronomicon and the Daemonolatreia of Remigius, in which he seemed hopeful of finding some formula to check the peril he conjured up.      “Stop them, stop them!” he would shout. “Those Whateleys meant to let them in, and the worst of all is left! Tell Rice and Morgan we must do something—it’s a blind business, but I know how to make the powder. . . . It hasn’t been fed since the second of August, when Wilbur came here to his death, and at that rate. . . .”      But Armitage had a sound physique despite his seventy-three years, and slept off his disorder that night without developing any real fever. He woke late Friday, clear of head, though sober with a gnawing fear and tremendous sense of responsibility. Saturday afternoon he felt able to go over to the library and summon Rice and Morgan for a conference, and the rest of that day and evening the three men tortured their brains in the wildest speculation and the most desperate debate. Strange and terrible books were drawn voluminously from the stack shelves and from secure places of storage; and diagrams and formulae were copied with feverish haste and in bewildering abundance. Of scepticism there was none. All three had seen the body of Wilbur Whateley as it lay on the floor in a room of that very building, and after that not one of them could feel even slightly inclined to treat the diary as a madman’s raving.      Opinions were divided as to notifying the Massachusetts State Police, and the negative finally won. There were things involved which simply could not be believed by those who had not seen a sample, as indeed was made clear during certain subsequent investigations. Late at night the conference disbanded without having developed a definite plan, but all day Sunday Armitage was busy comparing formulae and mixing chemicals obtained from the college laboratory. The more he reflected on the hellish diary, the more he was inclined to doubt the efficacy of any material agent in stamping out the entity which Wilbur Whateley had left behind him—the earth-threatening entity which, unknown to him, was to burst forth in a few hours and become the memorable Dunwich horror.      Monday was a repetition of Sunday with Dr. Armitage, for the task in hand required an infinity of research and experiment. Further consultations of the monstrous diary brought about various changes of plan, and he knew that even in the end a large amount of uncertainty must remain. By Tuesday he had a definite line of action mapped out, and believed he would try a trip to Dunwich within a week. Then, on Wednesday, the great shock came. Tucked obscurely away in a corner of the Arkham Advertiser was a facetious little item from the Associated Press, telling what a record-breaking monster the bootleg whiskey of Dunwich had raised up. Armitage, half stunned, could only telephone for Rice and Morgan. Far into the night they discussed, and the next day was a whirlwind of preparation on the part of them all. Armitage knew he would be meddling with terrible powers, yet saw that there was no other way to annul the deeper and more malign meddling which others had done before him."]}
{"id": "EN031", "pair": ["III. A Search and an Evocation1.Charles Ward, as we have seen, first learned in 1918 of his descent from Joseph Curwen. That he at once took an intense interest in everything pertaining to the bygone mystery is not to be wondered at; for every vague rumour that he had heard of Curwen now became something vital to himself, in whom flowed Curwens blood. No spirited and imaginative genealogist could have done otherwise than begin forthwith an avid and systematic collection of Curwen data.      In his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at secrecy; so that even Dr. Lyman hesitates to date the youths madness from any period before the close of 1919. He talked freely with his family - though his mother was not particularly pleased to own an ancestor like Curwen - and with the officials of the various museums and libraries he visited. In applying to private families for records thought to be in their possession he made no concealment of his object, and shared the somewhat amused scepticism with which the accounts of the old diarists and letter-writers were regarded. He often expressed a keen wonder as to what really had taken place a century and a half before at that Pawtuxet farmhouse whose site he vainly tried to find, and what Joseph Curwen really had been.      When he came across the Smith diary and archives and encountered the letter from Jedediah Orne he decided to visit Salem and look up Curwens early activities and connexions there, which he did during the Easter vacation of 1919. At the Essex Institute, which was well known to him from former sojourns in the glamorous old town of crumbling Puritan gables and clustered gambrel roofs, he was very kindly received, and unearthed there a considerable amount of Curwen data. He found that his ancestor was born in Salem-Village, now Danvers, seven miles from town, on the eighteenth of February (O.S.) 1662-3; and that he had run away to sea at the age of fifteen, not appearing again for nine years, when he returned with the speech, dress, and manners of a native Englishman and settled in Salem proper. At that time he had little to do with his family, but spent most of his hours with the curious books he had brought from Europe, and the strange chemicals which came for him on ships from England, France, and Holland. Certain trips of his into the country were the objects of much local inquisitiveness, and were whisperingly associated with vague rumours of fires on the hills at night.      Curwens only close friends had been one Edward Hutchinson of Salem-Village and one Simon Orne of Salem. With these men he was often seen in conference about the Common, and visits among them were by no means infrequent. Hutchinson had a house well out toward the woods, and it was not altogether liked by sensitive people because of the sounds heard there at night. He was said to entertain strange visitors, and the lights seen from his windows were not always of the same colour. The knowledge he displayed concerning long-dead persons and long-forgotten events was considered distinctly unwholesome, and he disappeared about the time the witchcraft panic began, never to be heard from again. At that time Joseph Curwen also departed, but his settlement in Providence was soon learned of. Simon Orne lived in Salem until 1720, when his failure to grow visibly old began to excite attention. He thereafter disappeared, though thirty years later his precise counterpart and self-styled son turned up to claim his property. The claim was allowed on the strength of documents in Simon Ornes known hand, and Jedediah Orne continued to dwell in Salem till 1771, when certain letters from Providence citizens to the Rev. Thomas Barnard and others brought about his quiet removal to parts unknown.      Certain documents by and about all of these strange characters were available at the Essex Institute, the Court House, and the Registry of Deeds, and included both harmless commonplaces such as land titles and bills of sale, and furtive fragments of a more provocative nature. There were four or five unmistakable allusions to them on the witchcraft trial records; as when one Hepzibah Lawson swore on July 10, 1692, at the Court of Oyer and Terminer under Judge Hathorne, that fortie Witches and the Blacke Man were wont to meete in the Woodes behind Mr. Hutchinsons house, and one Amity How declared at a session of August 8th before Judge Gedney that Mr. G. B. (Rev. George Burroughs) on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B. Then there was a catalogue of Hutchinsons uncanny library as found after his disappearance, and an unfinished manuscript in his handwriting, couched in a cipher none could read. Ward had a photostatic copy of this manuscript made, and began to work casually on the cipher as soon as it was delivered to him. After the following August his labours on the cipher became intense and feverish, and there is reason to believe from his speech and conduct that he hit upon the key before October or November. He never stated, though, whether or not he had succeeded.      But of the greatest immediate interest was the Orne material. It took Ward only a short time to prove from identity of penmanship a thing he had already considered established from the text of the letter to Curwen; namely, that Simon Orne and his supposed son were one and the same person. As Orne had said to his correspondent, it was hardly safe to live too long in Salem, hence he resorted to a thirty-year sojourn abroad, and did not return to claim his lands except as a representative of a new generation. Orne had apparently been careful to destroy most of his correspondence, but the citizens who took action in 1771 found and preserved a few letters and papers which excited their wonder. There were cryptic formulae and diagrams in his and other hands which Ward now either copied with care or had photographed, and one extremely mysterious letter in a chirography that the searcher recognised from items in the Registry of Deeds as positively Joseph Curwens.      This Curwen letter, though undated as to the year, was evidently not the one in answer to which Orne had written the confiscated missive; and from internal evidence Ward placed it not much later than 1750. It may not be amiss to give the text in full, as a sample of the style of one whose history was so dark and terrible. The recipient is addressed as \"Simon\", but a line (whether drawn by Curwen or Orne Ward could not tell) is run through the word.Prouidence, I.

This letter, oddly enough, was what first gave Ward the exact location of Curwens Providence home; for none of the records encountered up to that time had been at all specific. The discovery was doubly striking because it indicated as the newer Curwen house built in 1761 on the site of the old, a dilapidated building still standing in Olney Court and well known to Ward in his antiquarian rambles over Stampers Hill. The place was indeed only a few squares from his own home on the great hills higher ground, and was now the abode of a negro family much esteemed for occasional washing, housecleaning, and furnace-tending services. To find, in distant Salem, such sudden proof of the significance of this familiar rookery in his own family history, was a highly impressive thing to Ward; and he resolved to explore the place immediately upon his return. The more mystical phases of the letter, which he took to be some extravagant kind of symbolism, frankly baffled him; though he noted with a thrill of curiosity that the Biblical passage referred to - Job 14, 14 - was the familiar verse, \"If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.\"2.      Young Ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement, and spent the following Saturday in a long and exhaustive study of the house in Olney Court. The place, now crumbling with age, had never been a mansion; but was a modest two-and-a-half story wooden town house of the familiar Providence colonial type, with plain peaked roof, large central chimney, and artistically carved doorway with rayed fanlight, triangular pediment, and trim Doric pilasters. It had suffered but little alteration externally, and Ward felt he was gazing on something very close to the sinister matters of his quest.      The present negro inhabitants were known to him, and he was very courteously shewn about the interior by old Asa and his stout wife Hannah. Here there was more change than the outside indicated, and Ward saw with regret that fully half of the fine scroll-and-urn overmantels and shell-carved cupboard linings were gone, whilst much of the fine wainscotting and bolection moulding was marked, hacked, and gouged, or covered up altogether with cheap wall-paper. In general, the survey did not yield as much as Ward had somehow expected; but it was at least exciting to stand within the ancestral walls which had housed such a man of horror as Joseph Curwen. He saw with a thrill that a monogram had been very carefully effaced from the ancient brass knocker.      From then until after the close of school Ward spent his time on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local Curwen data. The former still proved unyielding; but of the latter he obtained so much, and so many clues to similar data elsewhere, that he was ready by July to make a trip to New London and New York to consult old letters whose presence in those places was indicated. This trip was very fruitful, for it brought him the Fenner letters with their terrible description of the Pawtuxet farmhouse raid, and the Nightingale-Talbot letters in which he learned of the portrait painted on a panel of the Curwen library. This matter of the portrait interested him particularly, since he would have given much to know just what Joseph Curwen looked like; and he decided to make a second search of the house in Olney Court to see if there might not be some trace of the ancient features beneath peeling coats of later paint or layers of mouldy wall-paper.      Early in August that search took place, and Ward went carefully over the walls of every room sizeable enough to have been by any possibility the library of the evil builder. He paid especial attention to the large panels of such overmantels as still remained; and was keenly excited after about an hour, when on a broad area above the fireplace in a spacious ground-floor room he became certain that the surface brought out by the peeling of several coats of paint was sensibly darker than any ordinary interior paint or the wood beneath it was likely to have been. A few more careful tests with a thin knife, and he knew that he had come upon an oil portrait of great extent. With truly scholarly restraint the youth did not risk the damage which an immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture with the knife might have done, but just retired from the scene of his discovery to enlist expert help. In three days he returned with an artist of long experience, Mr. Walter C. Dwight, whose studio is near the foot of College Hill; and that accomplished restorer of paintings set to work at once with proper methods and chemical substances. Old Asa and his wife were duly excited over their strange visitors, and were properly reimbursed for this invasion of their domestic hearth.      As day by day the work of restoration progressed, Charles Ward looked on with growing interest at the lines and shades gradually unveiled after their long oblivion. Dwight had begun at the bottom; hence since the picture was a three-quarter-length one, the face did not come out for some time. It was meanwhile seen that the subject was a spare, well-shaped man with dark-blue coat, embroidered waistcoat, black satin small-clothes, and white silk stockings, seated in a carved chair against the background of a window with wharves and ships beyond. When the head came out it was observed to bear a neat Albemarle wig, and to possess a thin, calm, undistinguished face which seemed somehow familiar to both Ward and the artist. Only at the very last, though, did the restorer and his client begin to gasp with astonishment at the details of that lean, pallid visage, and to recognise with a touch of awe the dramatic trick which heredity had played. For it took the final bath of oil and the final stroke of the delicate scraper to bring out fully the expression which centuries had hidden; and to confront the bewildered Charles Dexter Ward, dweller in the past, with his own living features in the countenance of his horrible great-great-great-grandfather.      Ward brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered, and his father at once determined to purchase the picture despite its execution on stationary panelling. The resemblance to the boy, despite an appearance of rather greater age, was marvellous; and it could be seen that through some trick of atavism the physical contours of Joseph Curwen had found precise duplication after a century and a half. Mrs. Wards resemblance to her ancestor was not at all marked, though she could recall relatives who had some of the facial characteristics shared by her son and by the bygone Curwen. She did not relish the discovery, and told her husband that he had better burn the picture instead of bringing it home. There was, she averred, something unwholesome about it; not only intrinsically, but in its very resemblance to Charles. Mr. Ward, however, was a practical man of power and affairs - a cotton manufacturer with extensive mills at Riverpoint in the Pawtuxet Valley - and not one to listen to feminine scruples. The picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to his son, and he believed the boy deserved it as a present. In this opinion, it is needless to say, Charles most heartily concurred; and a few days later Mr. Ward located the owner of the house - a small rodent-featured person with a guttural accent - and obtained the whole mantel and overmantel bearing the picture at a curtly fixed priced which cut short the impending torrent of unctuous haggling.      It now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the Ward home, where provisions were made for its thorough restoration and installation with an electric mock-fireplace in Charless third-floor study or library. To Charles was left the task of superintending this removal, and on the twenty-eighth of August he accompanied two expert workmen from the Crooker decorating firm to the house in Olney Court, where the mantel and portrait-bearing overmantel were detached with great care and precision for transportation in the companys motor truck. There was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the chimneys course, and in this young Ward observed a cubical recess about a foot square, which must have lain directly behind the head of the portrait. Curious as to what such a space might mean or contain, the youth approached and looked within; finding beneath the deep coatings of dust and soot some loose yellowed papers, a crude, thick copybook, and a few mouldering textile shreds which may have formed the ribbon binding the rest together. Blowing away the bulk of the dirt and cinders, he took up the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover. It was in a hand which he had learned to recognise at the Essex Institute, and proclaimed the volume as the \"Journall and Notes of Jos: Curwen, Gent., of Providence-Plantations, Late of Salem.\"      Excited beyond measure by his discovery, Ward shewed the book to the two curious workmen beside him. Their testimony is absolute as to the nature and genuineness of the finding, and Dr. Willett relies on them to help establish his theory that the youth was not mad when he began his major eccentricities. All the other papers were likewise in Curwens handwriting, and one of them seemed especially portentous because of its inscription: \"To Him Who Shal Come After, & How He May Gett Beyonde Time & ye Spheres.\" Another was in a cipher; the same, Ward hoped, as the Hutchinson cipher which had hitherto baffled him. A third, and here the searcher rejoiced, seemed to be a key to the cipher; whilst the fourth and fifth were addressed respectively to \"Edw: Hutchinson, Armiger\" and \"Jedediah Orne, Esq.\", or Their Heir or Heirs, or Those Representg Them. The sixth and last was inscribed: \"Joseph Curwen his Life and Travells Betn ye yeares 1678 and 1687: Of Whither He Voyagd, Where He Stayd, Whom He Sawe, and What He Learnt.\"3.      We have now reached the point from which the more academic school of alienists date Charles Wards madness. Upon his discovery the youth had looked immediately at a few of the inner pages of the book and manuscripts, and had evidently seen something which impressed him tremendously. Indeed, in shewing the titles to the workmen he appeared to guard the text itself with peculiar care, and to labour under a perturbation for which even the antiquarian and genealogical significance of the find could hardly account. Upon returning home he broke the news with an almost embarrassed air, as if he wished to convey an idea of its supreme importance without having to exhibit the evidence itself. He did not even shew the titles to his parents, but simply told them that he had found some documents in Joseph Curwens handwriting, \"mostly in cipher\", which would have to be studied very carefully before yielding up their true meaning. It is unlikely that he would have shewn what he did to the workmen, had it not been for their unconcealed curiosity. As it was he doubtless wished to avoid any display of peculiar reticence which would increase their discussion of the matter.      That night Charles Ward sat up in his room reading the new-found book and papers, and when day came he did not desist. His meals, on his urgent request when his mother called to see what was amiss, were sent up to him; and in the afternoon he appeared only briefly when the men came to install the Curwen picture and mantelpiece in his study. The next night he slept in snatches in his clothes, meanwhile wrestling feverishly with the unravelling of the cipher manuscript. In the morning his mother saw that he was at work on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher, which he had frequently shewn her before; but in response to her query he said that the Curwen key could not be applied to it. That afternoon he abandoned his work and watched the men fascinatedly as they finished their installation of the picture with its woodwork above a cleverly realistic electric log, setting the mock-fireplace and overmantel a little out from the north wall as if a chimney existed, and boxing in the sides with panelling to match the rooms. The front panel holding the picture was sawn and hinged to allow cupboard space behind it. After the workmen went he moved his work into the study and sat down before it with his eyes half on the cipher and half on the portrait which stared back at him like a year-adding and century-recalling mirror.      His parents, subsequently recalling his conduct at this period, give interesting details anent the policy of concealment which he practiced. Before servants he seldom hid any paper which he might be studying, since he rightly assumed that Curwens intricate and archaic chirography would be too much for them. With his parents, however, he was more circumspect; and unless the manuscript in question were a cipher, or a mere mass of cryptic symbols and unknown ideographs (as that entitled \"To Him Who Shal Come After etc.\" seemed to be), he would cover it with some convenient paper until his caller had departed. At night he kept the papers under lock and key in an antique cabinet of his, where he also placed them whenever he left the room. He soon resumed fairly regular hours and habits, except that his long walks and other outside interests seemed to cease. The opening of school, where he now began his senior year, seemed a great bore to him; and he frequently asserted his determination never to bother with college. He had, he said, important special investigations to make, which would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and the humanities than any university which the world could boast.      Naturally, only one who had always been more or less studious, eccentric, and solitary could have pursued this course for many days without attracting notice. Ward, however, was constitutionally a scholar and a hermit; hence his parents were less surprised than regretful at the close confinement and secrecy he adopted. At the same time, both his father and mother thought it odd that he would shew them no scrap of his treasure-trove, nor give any connected account of such data as he had deciphered. This reticence he explained away as due to a wish to wait until he might announce some connected revelation, but as the weeks passed without further disclosures there began to grow up between the youth and his family a kind of constraint; intensified in his mothers case by her manifest disapproval of all Curwen delvings.      During October Ward began visiting the libraries again, but no longer for the antiquarian matter of his former days. Witchcraft and magic, occultism and daemonology, were what he sought now; and when Providence sources proved unfruitful he would take the train for Boston and tap the wealth of the great library in Copley Square, the Widener Library at Harvard, or the Zion Research Library in Brookline, where certain rare works on Biblical subjects are available. He bought extensively, and fitted up a whole additional set of shelves in his study for newly acquired works on uncanny subjects; while during the Christmas holidays he made a round of out-of-town trips including one to Salem to consult certain records at the Essex Institute.      About the middle of January, 1920, there entered Wards bearing an element of triumph which he did not explain, and he was no more found at work upon the Hutchinson cipher. Instead, he inaugurated a dual policy of chemical research and record-scanning; fitting up for the one a laboratory in the unused attic of the house, and for the latter haunting all the sources of vital statistics in Providence. Local dealers in drugs and scientific supplies, later questioned, gave astonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and instruments he purchased; but clerks at the State House, the City Hall, and the various libraries agree as to the definite object of his second interest. He was searching intensely and feverishly for the grave of Joseph Curwen, from whose slate slab an older generation had so wisely blotted the name.      Little by little there grew upon the Ward family the conviction that something was wrong. Charles had had freaks and changes of minor interests before, but this growing secrecy and absorption in strange pursuits was unlike even him. His school work was the merest pretence; and although he failed in no test, it could be seen that the old application had all vanished. He had other concernments now; and when not in his new laboratory with a score of obsolete alchemical books, could be found either poring over old burial records down town or glued to his volumes of occult lore in his study, where the startlingly - one almost fancied increasingly - similar features of Joseph Curwen stared blandly at him from the great overmantel on the north wall.      Late in March Ward added to his archive-searching a ghoulish series of rambles about the various ancient cemeteries of the city. The cause appeared later, when it was learned from City Hall clerks that he had probably found an important clue. His quest had suddenly shifted from the grave of Joseph Curwen to that of one Naphthali Field; and this shift was explained when, upon going over the files that he had been over, the investigators actually found a fragmentary record of Curwens burial which had escaped the general obliteration, and which stated that the curious leaden coffin had been interred \"10 ft. S. and 5 ft. W. of Naphthali Fields grave in ye - \". The lack of a specified burying-ground in the surviving entry greatly complicated the search, and Naphthali Fields grave seemed as elusive as that of Curwen; but here no systematic effacement had existed, and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on the stone itself even if its record had perished. Hence the rambles - from which St. Johns (the former Kings) Churchyard and the ancient Congregational burying-ground in the midst of Swan Point Cemetery were excluded, since other statistics had shewn that the only Naphthali Field (obiit 1729) whose grave could have been meant had been a Baptist.4.      It was toward May when Dr. Willett, at the request of the senior Ward, and fortified with all the Curwen data which the family had gleaned from Charles in his non-secretive days, talked with the young man. The interview was of little value or conclusiveness, for Willett felt at every moment that Charles was thoroughly master of himself and in touch with matters of real importance; but it at least forced the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanour. Of a pallid, impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment, Ward seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits, though not to reveal their object. He stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early scientific knowledge, for the most part in cipher, of an apparent scope comparable only to the discoveries of Friar Bacon and perhaps surpassing even those. They were, however, meaningless except when correlated with a body of learning now wholly obsolete; so that their immediate presentation to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all impressiveness and dramatic significance. To take their vivid place in the history of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of which they evolved, and to this task of correlation Ward was now devoting himself. He was seeking to acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of the Curwen data must possess, and hoped in time to make a full announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to the world of thought. Not even Einstein, he declared, could more profoundly revolutionise the current conception of things.      As to his graveyard search, whose object he freely admitted, but the details of whose progress he did not relate, he said he had reason to think that Joseph Curwens mutilated headstone bore certain mystic symbols - carved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by those who had effaced the name - which were absolutely essential to the final solution of his cryptic system. Curwen, he believed, had wished to guard his secret with care; and had consequently distributed the data in an exceedingly curious fashion. When Dr. Willett asked to see the mystic documents, Ward displayed much reluctance and tried to put him off with such things as photostatic copies of the Hutchinson cipher and Orne formulae and diagrams; but finally shewed him the exteriors of some of the real Curwen finds - the \"Journall and Notes\", the cipher (title in cipher also), and the formula-filled message \"To Him Who Shal Come After\" - and let him glance inside such as were in obscure characters.      He also opened the diary at a page carefully selected for its innocuousness and gave Willett a glimpse of Curwens connected handwriting in English. The doctor noted very closely the crabbed and complicated letters, and the general aura of the seventeenth century which clung round both penmanship and style despite the writers survival into the eighteenth century, and became quickly certain that the document was genuine. The text itself was relatively trivial, and Willett recalled only a fragment:\"Wedn. 16 Octr. 1754. My Sloope the Wakeful this Day putt in from London with XX newe Men pickd up in ye Indies, Spaniards from Martineco and 2 Dutch Men from Surinam.

Simon hath not Writ these V. Weekes, but I expecte soon hearg from him.\"      When upon reaching this point Dr. Willett turned the leaf he was quickly checked by Ward, who almost snatched the book from his grasp. All that the doctor had a chance to see on the newly opened page was a brief pair of sentences; but these, strangely enough, lingered tenaciously in his memory. They ran: \"Ye Verse from Liber-Damnatus beg spoke V Roodmasses and IV Hallows-Eves, I am Hopeful ye Thing is breedg Outside ye Spheres. It will drawe One who is to Come, if I can make sure he shal bee, and he shall think on Past thinges and look back thro all ye yeares, against ye which I must have ready ye Saltes or That to make em with.\"      Willett saw no more, but somehow this small glimpse gave a new and vague terror to the painted features of Joseph Curwen which stared blandly down from the overmantel. Ever after that he entertained the odd fancy - which his medical skill of course assured him was only a fancy - that the eyes of the portrait had a sort of wish, if not an actual tendency, to follow young Charles Ward as he moved about the room. He stopped before leaving to study the picture closely, marvelling at its resemblance to Charles and memorising every minute detail of the cryptical, colourless face, even down to a slight scar or pit in the smooth brow above the right eye. Cosmo Alexander, he decided, was a painter worthy of the Scotland that produced Raeburn, and a teacher worthy of his illustrious pupil Gilbert Stuart.      Assured by the doctor that Charless mental health was in no danger, but that on the other hand he was engaged in researches which might prove of real importance, the Wards were more lenient than they might otherwise have been when during the following June the youth made positive his refusal to attend college. He had, he declared, studies of much more vital importance to pursue; and intimated a wish to go abroad the following year in order to avail himself of certain sources of data not existing in America. The senior Ward, while denying this latter wish as absurd for a boy of only eighteen, acquiesced regarding the university; so that after a none too brilliant graduation from the Moses Brown School there ensued for Charles a three-year period of intensive occult study and graveyard searching. He became recognised as an eccentric, and dropped even more completely from the sight of his familys friends than he had been before; keeping close to his work and only occasionally making trips to other cities to consult obscure records. Once he went south to talk with a strange old mulatto who dwelt in a swamp and about whom a newspaper had printed a curious article. Again he sought a small village in the Adirondacks whence reports of certain odd ceremonial practices had come. But still his parents forbade him the trip to the Old World which he desired.      Coming of age in April, 1923, and having previously inherited a small competence from his maternal grandfather, Ward determined at last to take the European trip hitherto denied him. Of his proposed itinerary he would say nothing save that the needs of his studies would carry him to many places, but he promised to write his parents fully and faithfully. When they saw he could not be dissuaded, they ceased all opposition and helped as best they could; so that in June the young man sailed for Liverpool with the farewell blessings of his father and mother, who accompanied him to Boston and waved him out of sight from the White Star pier in Charlestown. Letters soon told of his safe arrival, and of his securing good quarters in Great Russell Street, London; where he proposed to stay, shunning all family friends, till he had exhausted the resources of the British Museum in a certain direction. Of his daily life he wrote but little, for there was little to write. Study and experiment consumed all his time, and he mentioned a laboratory which he had established in one of his rooms. That he said nothing of antiquarian rambles in the glamorous old city with its luring skyline of ancient domes and steeples and its tangles of roads and alleys whose mystic convolutions and sudden vistas alternately beckon and surprise, was taken by his parents as a good index of the degree to which his new interests had engrossed his mind.      In June, 1924, a brief note told of his departure for Paris, to which he had before made one or two flying trips for material in the Bibliothque Nationale. For three months thereafter he sent only postal cards, giving an address in the Rue St. Jacques and referring to a special search among rare manuscripts in the library of an unnamed private collector. He avoided acquaintances, and no tourists brought back reports of having seen him. Then came a silence, and in October the Wards received a picture card from Prague, Czecho-Slovakia, stating that Charles was in that ancient town for the purpose of conferring with a certain very aged man supposed to be the last living possessor of some very curious mediaeval information. He gave an address in the Neustadt, and announced no move till the following January; when he dropped several cards from Vienna telling of his passage through that city on the way toward a more easterly region whither one of his correspondents and fellow-delvers into the occult had invited him.      The next card was from Klausenburg in Transylvania, and told of Wards progress toward his destination. He was going to visit a Baron Ferenczy, whose estate lay in the mountains east of Rakus; and was to be addressed at Rakus in the care of that nobleman. Another card from Rakus a week later, saying that his hosts carriage had met him and that he was leaving the village for the mountains, was his last message for a considerable time; indeed, he did not reply to his parents frequent letters until May, when he wrote to discourage the plan of his mother for a meeting in London, Paris, or Rome during the summer, when the elder Wards were planning to travel in Europe. His researches, he said, were such that he could not leave his present quarters; while the situation of Baron Ferenczys castle did not favour visits. It was on a crag in the dark wooded mountains, and the region was so shunned by the country folk that normal people could not help feeling ill at ease. Moreover, the Baron was not a person likely to appeal to correct and conservative New England gentlefolk. His aspect and manners had idiosyncrasies, and his age was so great as to be disquieting. It would be better, Charles said, if his parents would wait for his return to Providence; which could scarcely be far distant.      That return did not, however, take place until May, 1926, when after a few heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into New York on the Homeric and traversed the long miles to Providence by motor-coach, eagerly drinking in the green rolling hills, the fragrant, blossoming orchards, and the white steepled towns of vernal Connecticut; his first taste of ancient New England in nearly four years. When the coach crossed the Pawcatuck and entered Rhode Island amidst the faery goldenness of a late spring afternoon his heart beat with quickened force, and the entry to Providence along Reservoir and Elmwood avenues was a breathless and wonderful thing despite the depths of forbidden lore to which he had delved. At the high square where Broad, Weybosset, and Empire Streets join, he saw before and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant, remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town; and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down the terminal behind the Biltmore, bringing into view the great dome and soft, roof-pierced greenery of the ancient hill across the river, and the tall colonial spire of the First Baptist Church limned pink in the magic evening light against the fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous background.      Old Providence! It was this place and the mysterious forces of its long, continuous history which had brought him into being, and which had drawn him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no prophet might fix. Here lay the arcana, wondrous or dreadful as the case might be, for which all his years of travel and application had been preparing him. A taxicab whirled him through Post Office Square with its glimpse of the river, the old Market House, and the head of the bay, and up the steep curved slope of Waterman Street to Prospect, where the vast gleaming dome and sunset-flushed Ionic columns of the Christian Science Church beckoned northward. Then eight squares past the fine old estates his childish eyes had known, and the quaint brick sidewalks so often trodden by his youthful feet. And at last the little white overtaken farmhouse on the right, on the left the classic Adam porch and stately bayed facade of the great brick house where he was born. It was twilight, and Charles Dexter Ward had come home.5.      A school of alienists slightly less academic than Dr. Lymans assign to Wards European trip the beginning of his true madness. Admitting that he was sane when he started, they believe that his conduct upon returning implies a disastrous change. But even to this claim Dr. Willett refuses to accede. There was, he insists, something later; and the queernesses of the youth at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroad - odd enough things, to be sure, but by no means implying mental aberration on the part of their celebrant. Ward himself, though visibly aged and hardened, was still normal in his general reactions; and in several talks with Willett displayed a balance which no madman - even an incipient one - could feign continuously for long. What elicited the notion of insanity at this period were the sounds heard at all hours from Wards attic laboratory, in which he kept himself most of the time. There were chantings and repetitions, and thunderous declamations in uncanny rhythms; and although these sounds were always in Wards own voice, there was something in the quality of that voice, and in the accents of the formulae it pronounced, which could not but chill the blood of every hearer. It was noticed that Nig, the venerable and beloved black cat of the household, bristled and arched his back perceptibly when certain of the tones were heard.      The odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise exceedingly strange. Sometimes they were very noxious, but more often they were aromatic, with a haunting, elusive quality which seemed to have the power of inducing fantastic images. People who smelled them had a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas, with strange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite distance. Ward did not resume his old-time rambles, but applied himself diligently to the strange books he had brought home, and to equally strange delvings within his quarters; explaining that European sources had greatly enlarged the possibilities of his work, and promising great revelations in the years to come. His older aspect increased to a startling degree his resemblance to the Curwen portrait in his library; and Dr. Willett would often pause by the latter after a call, marvelling at the virtual identity, and reflecting that only the small pit above the pictures right eye now remained to differentiate the long-dead wizard from the living youth. These calls of Willetts, undertaken at the request of the senior Wards, were curious affairs. Ward at no time repulsed the doctor, but the latter saw that he could never reach the young mans inner psychology. Frequently he noted peculiar things about; little wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables, and the half-erased remnants of circles, triangles, and pentagrams in chalk or charcoal on the cleared central space of the large room. And always in the night those rhythms and incantations thundered, till it became very difficult to keep servants or suppress furtive talk of Charless madness.      In January, 1927, a peculiar incident occurred. One night about midnight, as Charles was chanting a ritual whose weird cadence echoed unpleasantly through the house below, there came a sudden gust of chill wind from the bay, and a faint, obscure trembling of the earth which everyone in the neighbourhood noted. At the same time the cat exhibited phenomenal traces of fright, while dogs bayed for as much as a mile around. This was the prelude to a sharp thunderstorm, anomalous for the season, which brought with it such a crash that Mr. and Mrs. Ward believed the house had been struck. They rushed upstairs to see what damage had been done, but Charles met them at the door to the attic; pale, resolute, and portentous, with an almost fearsome combination of triumph and seriousness on his face. He assured them that the house had not really been struck, and that the storm would soon be over. They paused, and looking through a window saw that he was indeed right; for the lightning flashed farther and farther off, whilst the trees ceased to bend in the strange frigid gust from the water. The thunder sank to a sort of dull mumbling chuckle and finally died away. Stars came out, and the stamp of triumph on Charles Wards face crystallised into a very singular expression.      For two months or more after this incident Ward was less confined than usual to his laboratory. He exhibited a curious interest in the weather, and made odd inquiries about the date of the spring thawing of the ground. One night late in March he left the house after midnight, and did not return till almost morning; when his mother, being wakeful, heard a rumbling motor draw up to the carriage entrance. Muffled oaths could be distinguished, and Mrs. Ward, rising and going to the window, saw four dark figures removing a long, heavy box from a truck at Charless direction and carrying it within by the side door. She heard laboured breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs, and finally a dull thumping in the attic; after which the footfalls descended again, and the four men reappeared outside and drove off in their truck.      The next day Charles resumed his strict attic seclusion, drawing down the dark shades of his laboratory windows and appearing to be working on some metal substance. He would open the door to no one, and steadfastly refused all proffered food. About noon a wrenching sound followed by a terrible cry and a fall were heard, but when Mrs. Ward rapped at the door her son at length answered faintly, and told her that nothing had gone amiss. The hideous and indescribable stench now welling out was absolutely harmless and unfortunately necessary. Solitude was the one prime essential, and he would appear later for dinner. That afternoon, after the conclusion of some odd hissing sounds which came from behind the locked portal, he did finally appear; wearing an extremely haggard aspect and forbidding anyone to enter the laboratory upon any pretext. This, indeed, proved the beginning of a new policy of secrecy; for never afterward was any other person permitted to visit either the mysterious garret workroom or the adjacent storeroom which he cleaned out, furnished roughly, and added to his inviolably private domain as a sleeping apartment. Here he lived, with books brought up from his library beneath, till the time he purchased the Pawtuxet bungalow and moved to it all his scientific effects.      In the evening Charles secured the paper before the rest of the family and damaged part of it through an apparent accident. Later on Dr. Willett, having fixed the date from statements by various members of the household, looked up an intact copy at the Journal office and found that in the destroyed section the following small item had occurred:Nocturnal Diggers Surprised inNorth Burial GroundRobert Hart, night watchman at the North Burial Ground, this morning discovered a party of several men with a motor truck in the oldest part of the cemetery, but apparently frightened them off before they had accomplished whatever their object may have been.      The discovery took place at about four oclock, when Harts attention was attracted by the sound of a motor outside his shelter. Investigating, he saw a large truck on the main drive several rods away; but could not reach it before the sound of his feet on the gravel had revealed his approach. The men hastily placed a large box in the truck and drove away toward the street before they could be overtaken; and since no known grave was disturbed, Hart believes that this box was an object which they wished to bury.      The diggers must have been at work for a long while before detection, for Hart found an enormous hole dug at a considerable distance back from the roadway in the lot of Amasa Field, where most of the old stones have long ago disappeared. The hole, a place as large and deep as a grave, was empty; and did not coincide with any interment mentioned in the cemetery records.      Sergt. Riley of the Second Station viewed the spot and gave the opinion that the hole was dug by bootleggers rather gruesomely and ingeniously seeking a safe cache for liquor in a place not likely to be disturbed. In reply to questions Hart said he thought the escaping truck had headed up Rochambeau Avenue, though he could not be sure.      During the next few days Ward was seldom seen by his family. Having added sleeping quarters to his attic realm, he kept closely to himself there, ordering food brought to the door and not taking it in until after the servant had gone away. The droning of monotonous formulae and the chanting of bizarre rhythms recurred at intervals, while at other times occasional listeners could detect the sound of tinkling glass, hissing chemicals, running water, or roaring gas flames. Odours of the most unplaceable quality, wholly unlike any before noted, hung at times around the door; and the air of tension observable in the young recluse whenever he did venture briefly forth was such as to excite the keenest speculation. Once he made a hasty trip to the Athenaeum for a book he required, and again he hired a messenger to fetch him a highly obscure volume from Boston. Suspense was written portentously over the whole situation, and both the family and Dr. Willett confessed themselves wholly at a loss what to do or think about it.6.      Then on the fifteenth of April a strange development occurred. While nothing appeared to grow different in kind, there was certainly a very terrible difference in degree; and Dr. Willett somehow attaches great significance to the change. The day was Good Friday, a circumstance of which the servants made much, but which others quite naturally dismiss as an irrelevant coincidence. Late in the afternoon young Ward began repeating a certain formula in a singularly loud voice, at the same time burning some substance so pungent that its fumes escaped over the entire house. The formula was so plainly audible in the hall outside the locked door that Mrs. Ward could not help memorising it as she waited and listened anxiously, and later on she was able to write it down at Dr. Willetts request. It ran as follows, and experts have told Dr. Willett that its very close analogue can be found in the mystic writings of \"Eliphas Levi\", that cryptic soul who crept through a crack in the forbidden door and glimpsed the frightful vistas of the void beyond:\"Per Adonai Eloim, Adonai Jehova,Adonai Sabaoth, Metraton On Agla Mathon,verbum pythonicum, mysterium salamandrae,conventus sylvorum, antra gnomorum,daemonia Coeli Gad, Almousin, Gibor, Jehosua,Evam, Zariatnatmik, veni, veni, veni.\"      This had been going on for two hours without change or intermission when over all the neighbourhood a pandaemoniac howling of dogs set in. The extent of this howling can be judged from the space it received in the papers the next day, but to those in the Ward household it was overshadowed by the odour which instantly followed it; a hideous, all-pervasive odour which none of them had ever smelt before or have ever smelt since. In the midst of this mephitic flood there came a very perceptible flash like that of lightning, which would have been blinding and impressive but for the daylight around; and then was heard the voice that no listener can ever forget because of its thunderous remoteness, its incredible depth, and its eldritch dissimilarity to Charles Wards voice. It shook the house, and was clearly heard by at least two neighbours above the howling of the dogs. Mrs. Ward, who had been listening in despair outside her sons locked laboratory, shivered as she recognised its hellish import; for Charles had told her of its evil fame in dark books, and of the manner in which it had thundered, according to the Fenner letters, above the doomed Pawtuxet farmhouse on the night of Joseph Curwens annihilation. There was no mistaking that nightmare phrase, for Charles had described it too vividly in the old days when he had talked frankly of his Curwen investigations. And yet it was only this fragment of an archaic and forgotten language: \"DIES MIES JESCHET BOENE DOESEF DOUVEMA ENITEMAUS\".      Close upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening of the daylight, though sunset was still an hour distant, and then a puff of added odour different from the first but equally unknown and intolerable. Charles was chanting again now and his mother could hear syllables that sounded like \"Yi-nash-Yog-Sothoth-he-lgeb-fi-throdog\" - ending in a \"Yah!\" whose maniacal force mounted in an ear-splitting crescendo. A second later all previous memories were effaced by the wailing scream which burst out with frantic explosiveness and gradually changed form to a paroxysm of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Mrs. Ward, with the mingled fear and blind courage of maternity, advanced and knocked affrightedly at the concealing panels, but obtained no sign of recognition. She knocked again, but paused nervelessly as a second shriek arose, this one unmistakably in the familiar voice of her son, and sounding concurrently with the still bursting cachinnations of that other voice. Presently she fainted, although she is still unable to recall the precise and immediate cause. Memory sometimes makes merciful deletions.      Mr. Ward returned from the business section at about quarter past six; and not finding his wife downstairs, was told by the frightened servants that she was probably watching at Charless door, from which the sounds had been far stranger than ever before. Mounting the stairs at once, he saw Mrs. Ward stretched at full length on the floor of the corridor outside the laboratory; and realising that she had fainted, hastened to fetch a glass of water from a set bowl in a neighbouring alcove. Dashing the cold fluid in her face, he was heartened to observe an immediate response on her part, and was watching the bewildered opening of her eyes when a chill shot through him and threatened to reduce him to the very state from which she was emerging. For the seemingly silent laboratory was not as silent as it had appeared to be, but held the murmurs of a tense, muffled conversation in tones too low for comprehension, yet of a quality profoundly disturbing to the soul.      It was not, of course, new for Charles to mutter formulae; but this muttering was definitely different. It was so palpably a dialogue, or imitation of a dialogue, with the regular alteration of inflections suggesting question and answer, statement and response. One voice was undisguisedly that of Charles, but the other had a depth and hollowness which the youths best powers of ceremonial mimicry had scarcely approached before. There was something hideous, blasphemous, and abnormal about it, and but for a cry from his recovering wife which cleared his mind by arousing his protective instincts it is not likely that Theodore Howland Ward could have maintained for nearly a year more his old boast that he had never fainted. As it was, he seized his wife in his arms and bore her quickly downstairs before she could notice the voices which had so horribly disturbed him. Even so, however, he was not quick enough to escape catching something himself which caused him to stagger dangerously with his burden. For Mrs. Wards cry had evidently been heard by others than he, and there had come from behind the locked door the first distinguishable words which that masked and terrible colloquy had yielded. They were merely an excited caution in Charless own voice, but somehow their implications held a nameless fright for the father who overheard them. The phrase was just this: \"Sshh! - write!\"      Mr. and Mrs. Ward conferred at some length after dinner, and the former resolved to have a firm and serious talk with Charles that very night. No matter how important the object, such conduct could no longer be permitted; for these latest developments transcended every limit of sanity and formed a menace to the order and nervous well-being of the entire household. The youth must indeed have taken complete leave of his senses, since only downright madness could have prompted the wild screams and imaginary conversations in assumed voices which the present day had brought forth. All this must be stopped, or Mrs. Ward would be made ill and the keeping of servants become an impossibility.      Mr. Ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for Charless laboratory. On the third floor, however, he paused at the sounds which he heard proceeding from the now disused library of his son. Books were apparently being flung about and papers wildly rustled, and upon stepping to the door Mr. Ward beheld the youth within, excitedly assembling a vast armful of literary matter of every size and shape. Charless aspect was very drawn and haggard, and he dropped his entire load with a start at the sound of his fathers voice. At the elder mans command he sat down, and for some time listened to the admonitions he had so long deserved. There was no scene. At the end of the lecture he agreed that his father was right, and that his noises, mutterings, incantations, and chemical odours were indeed inexcusable nuisances. He agreed to a policy of greater quiet, though insisting on a prolongation of his extreme privacy. Much of his future work, he said, was in any case purely book research; and he could obtain quarters elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be necessary at a later stage. For the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed the keenest contrition, and explained that the conversation later heard was part of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental atmosphere. His use of abstruse technical terms somewhat bewildered Mr. Ward, but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and poise despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity. The interview was really quite inconclusive, and as Charles picked up his armful and left the room Mr. Ward hardly knew what to make of the entire business. It was as mysterious as the death of poor old Nig, whose stiffening form had been found an hour before in the basement, with staring eyes and fear-distorted mouth.      Driven by some vague detective instinct, the bewildered parent now glanced curiously at the vacant shelves to see what his son had taken up to the attic. The youths library was plainly and rigidly classified, so that one might tell at a glance the books or at least the kind of books which had been withdrawn. On this occasion Mr. Ward was astonished to find that nothing of the occult or the antiquarian, beyond what had been previously removed, was missing. These new withdrawals were all modern items; histories, scientific treatises, geographies, manuals of literature, philosophic works, and certain contemporary newspapers and magazines. It was a very curious shift from Charles Wards recent run of reading, and the father paused in a growing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense of strangeness. The strangeness was a very poignant sensation, and almost clawed at his chest as he strove to see just what was wrong around him. Something was indeed wrong, and tangibly as well as spiritually so. Ever since he had been in this room he had known that something was amiss, and at last it dawned upon him what it was.      On the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the house in Olney Court, but to the cracked and precariously restored oils of the large Curwen portrait disaster had come. Time and unequal heating had done their work at last, and at some time since the rooms last cleaning the worst had happened. Peeling clear of the wood, curling tighter and tighter, and finally crumbling into small bits with what must have been malignly silent suddenness, the portrait of Joseph Curwen had resigned forever its staring surveillance of the youth it so strangely resembled, and now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust.", "VII.Yet all this was only the prologue of the actual Dunwich horror. Formalities were gone through by bewildered officials, abnormal details were duly kept from press and public, and men were sent to Dunwich and Aylesbury to look up property and notify any who might be heirs of the late Wilbur Whateley. They found the countryside in great agitation, both because of the growing rumblings beneath the domed hills, and because of the unwonted stench and the surging, lapping sounds which came increasingly from the great empty shell formed by Whateley’s boarded-up farmhouse. Earl Sawyer, who tended the horse and cattle during Wilbur’s absence, had developed a woefully acute case of nerves. The officials devised excuses not to enter the noisome boarded place; and were glad to confine their survey of the deceased’s living quarters, the newly mended sheds, to a single visit. They filed a ponderous report at the court-house in Aylesbury, and litigations concerning heirship are said to be still in progress amongst the innumerable Whateleys, decayed and undecayed, of the upper Miskatonic valley.      An almost interminable manuscript in strange characters, written in a huge ledger and adjudged a sort of diary because of the spacing and the variations in ink and penmanship, presented a baffling puzzle to those who found it on the old bureau which served as its owner’s desk. After a week of debate it was sent to Miskatonic University, together with the deceased’s collection of strange books, for study and possible translation; but even the best linguists soon saw that it was not likely to be unriddled with ease. No trace of the ancient gold with which Wilbur and Old Whateley always paid their debts has yet been discovered.      It was in the dark of September 9th that the horror broke loose. The hill noises had been very pronounced during the evening, and dogs barked frantically all night. Early risers on the 10th noticed a peculiar stench in the air. About seven o’clock Luther Brown, the hired boy at George Corey’s, between Cold Spring Glen and the village, rushed frenziedly back from his morning trip to Ten-Acre Meadow with the cows. He was almost convulsed with fright as he stumbled into the kitchen; and in the yard outside the no less frightened herd were pawing and lowing pitifully, having followed the boy back in the panic they shared with him. Between gasps Luther tried to stammer out his tale to Mrs. Corey.      “Up thar in the rud beyont the glen, Mis’ Corey—they’s suthin’ ben thar! It smells like thunder, an’ all the bushes an’ little trees is pushed back from the rud like they’d a haouse ben moved along of it. An’ that ain’t the wust, nuther. They’s prints in the rud, Mis’ Corey—great raound prints as big as barrel-heads, all sunk daown deep like a elephant had ben along, only they’s a sight more nor four feet could make! I looked at one or two afore I run, an’ I see every one was covered with lines spreadin’ aout from one place, like as if big palm-leaf fans—twict or three times as big as any they is—hed of ben paounded daown into the rud. An’ the smell was awful, like what it is araound Wizard Whateley’s ol’ haouse. . . .”      Here he faltered, and seemed to shiver afresh with the fright that had sent him flying home. Mrs. Corey, unable to extract more information, began telephoning the neighbours; thus starting on its rounds the overture of panic that heralded the major terrors. When she got Sally Sawyer, housekeeper at Seth Bishop’s, the nearest place to Whateley’s, it became her turn to listen instead of transmit; for Sally’s boy Chauncey, who slept poorly, had been up on the hill toward Whateley’s, and had dashed back in terror after one look at the place, and at the pasturage where Mr. Bishop’s cows had been left out all night.      “Yes, Mis’ Corey,” came Sally’s tremulous voice over the party wire, “Cha’ncey he just come back a-postin’, and couldn’t haff talk fer bein’ scairt! He says Ol’ Whateley’s haouse is all blowed up, with the timbers scattered raound like they’d ben dynamite inside; only the bottom floor ain’t through, but is all covered with a kind o’ tar-like stuff that smells awful an’ drips daown offen the aidges onto the graoun’ whar the side timbers is blown away. An’ they’s awful kinder marks in the yard, tew—great raound marks bigger raound than a hogshead, an’ all sticky with stuff like is on the blowed-up haouse. Cha’ncey he says they leads off into the medders, whar a great swath wider’n a barn is matted daown, an’ all the stun walls tumbled every whichway wherever it goes.      “An’ he says, says he, Mis’ Corey, as haow he sot to look fer Seth’s caows, frighted ez he was; an’ faound ’em in the upper pasture nigh the Devil’s Hop Yard in an awful shape. Haff on ’em’s clean gone, an’ nigh haff o’ them that’s left is sucked most dry o’ blood, with sores on ’em like they’s ben on Whateley’s cattle ever senct Lavinny’s black brat was born. Seth he’s gone aout naow to look at ’em, though I’ll vaow he wun’t keer ter git very nigh Wizard Whateley’s! Cha’ncey didn’t look keerful ter see whar the big matted-daown swath led arter it leff the pasturage, but he says he thinks it p’inted towards the glen rud to the village.      “I tell ye, Mis’ Corey, they’s suthin’ abroad as hadn’t orter be abroad, an’ I for one think that black Wilbur Whateley, as come to the bad eend he desarved, is at the bottom of the breedin’ of it. He wa’n’t all human hisself, I allus says to everybody; an’ I think he an’ Ol’ Whateley must a raised suthin’ in that there nailed-up haouse as ain’t even so human as he was. They’s allus ben unseen things araound Dunwich—livin’ things—as ain’t human an’ ain’t good fer human folks.      “The graoun’ was a-talkin’ lass night, an’ towards mornin’ Cha’ncey he heerd the whippoorwills so laoud in Col’ Spring Glen he couldn’t sleep nun. Then he thought he heerd another faint-like saound over towards Wizard Whateley’s—a kinder rippin’ or tearin’ o’ wood, like some big box er crate was bein’ opened fur off. What with this an’ that, he didn’t git to sleep at all till sunup, an’ no sooner was he up this mornin’, but he’s got to go over to Whateley’s an’ see what’s the matter. He see enough, I tell ye, Mis’ Corey! This dun’t mean no good, an’ I think as all the men-folks ought to git up a party an’ do suthin’. I know suthin’ awful’s abaout, an’ feel my time is nigh, though only Gawd knows jest what it is.      “Did your Luther take accaount o’ whar them big tracks led tew? No? Wal, Mis’ Corey, ef they was on the glen rud this side o’ the glen, an’ ain’t got to your haouse yet, I calc’late they must go into the glen itself. They would do that. I allus says Col’ Spring Glen ain’t no healthy nor decent place. The whippoorwills an’ fireflies there never did act like they was creaters o’ Gawd, an’ they’s them as says ye kin hear strange things a-rushin’ an’ a-talkin’ in the air daown thar ef ye stand in the right place, atween the rock falls an’ Bear’s Den.”      By that noon fully three-quarters of the men and boys of Dunwich were trooping over the roads and meadows between the new-made Whateley ruins and Cold Spring Glen, examining in horror the vast, monstrous prints, the maimed Bishop cattle, the strange, noisome wreck of the farmhouse, and the bruised, matted vegetation of the fields and roadsides. Whatever had burst loose upon the world had assuredly gone down into the great sinister ravine; for all the trees on the banks were bent and broken, and a great avenue had been gouged in the precipice-hanging underbrush. It was as though a house, launched by an avalanche, had slid down through the tangled growths of the almost vertical slope. From below no sound came, but only a distant, undefinable foetor; and it is not to be wondered at that the men preferred to stay on the edge and argue, rather than descend and beard the unknown Cyclopean horror in its lair. Three dogs that were with the party had barked furiously at first, but seemed cowed and reluctant when near the glen. Someone telephoned the news to the Aylesbury Transcript; but the editor, accustomed to wild tales from Dunwich, did no more than concoct a humorous paragraph about it; an item soon afterward reproduced by the Associated Press.      That night everyone went home, and every house and barn was barricaded as stoutly as possible. Needless to say, no cattle were allowed to remain in open pasturage. About two in the morning a frightful stench and the savage barking of the dogs awakened the household at Elmer Frye’s, on the eastern edge of Cold Spring Glen, and all agreed that they could hear a sort of muffled swishing or lapping sound from somewhere outside. Mrs. Frye proposed telephoning the neighbours, and Elmer was about to agree when the noise of splintering wood burst in upon their deliberations. It came, apparently, from the barn; and was quickly followed by a hideous screaming and stamping amongst the cattle. The dogs slavered and crouched close to the feet of the fear-numbed family. Frye lit a lantern through force of habit, but knew it would be death to go out into that black farmyard. The children and the womenfolk whimpered, kept from screaming by some obscure, vestigial instinct of defence which told them their lives depended on silence. At last the noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful moaning, and a great snapping, crashing, and crackling ensued. The Fryes, huddled together in the sitting-room, did not dare to move until the last echoes died away far down in Cold Spring Glen. Then, amidst the dismal moans from the stable and the daemoniac piping of late whippoorwills in the glen, Selina Frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she could of the second phase of the horror.      The next day all the countryside was in a panic; and cowed, uncommunicative groups came and went where the fiendish thing had occurred. Two titan swaths of destruction stretched from the glen to the Frye farmyard, monstrous prints covered the bare patches of ground, and one side of the old red barn had completely caved in. Of the cattle, only a quarter could be found and identified. Some of these were in curious fragments, and all that survived had to be shot. Earl Sawyer suggested that help be asked from Aylesbury or Arkham, but others maintained it would be of no use. Old Zebulon Whateley, of a branch that hovered about half way between soundness and decadence, made darkly wild suggestions about rites that ought to be practiced on the hill-tops. He came of a line where tradition ran strong, and his memories of chantings in the great stone circles were not altogether connected with Wilbur and his grandfather.      Darkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organise for real defence. In a few cases closely related families would band together and watch in the gloom under one roof; but in general there was only a repetition of the barricading of the night before, and a futile, ineffective gesture of loading muskets and setting pitchforks handily about. Nothing, however, occurred except some hill noises; and when the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had gone as swiftly as it had come. There were even bold souls who proposed an offensive expedition down in the glen, though they did not venture to set an actual example to the still reluctant majority.      When night came again the barricading was repeated, though there was less huddling together of families. In the morning both the Frye and the Seth Bishop households reported excitement among the dogs and vague sounds and stenches from afar, while early explorers noted with horror a fresh set of the monstrous tracks in the road skirting Sentinel Hill. As before, the sides of the road shewed a bruising indicative of the blasphemously stupendous bulk of the horror; whilst the conformation of the tracks seemed to argue a passage in two directions, as if the moving mountain had come from Cold Spring Glen and returned to it along the same path. At the base of the hill a thirty-foot swath of crushed shrubbery saplings led steeply upward, and the seekers gasped when they saw that even the most perpendicular places did not deflect the inexorable trail. Whatever the horror was, it could scale a sheer stony cliff of almost complete verticality; and as the investigators climbed around to the hill’s summit by safer routes they saw that the trail ended—or rather, reversed—there.      It was here that the Whateleys used to build their hellish fires and chant their hellish rituals by the table-like stone on May-Eve and Hallowmass. Now that very stone formed the centre of a vast space thrashed around by the mountainous horror, whilst upon its slightly concave surface was a thick and foetid deposit of the same tarry stickiness observed on the floor of the ruined Whateley farmhouse when the horror escaped. Men looked at one another and muttered. Then they looked down the hill. Apparently the horror had descended by a route much the same as that of its ascent. To speculate was futile. Reason, logic, and normal ideas of motivation stood confounded. Only old Zebulon, who was not with the group, could have done justice to the situation or suggested a plausible explanation.      Thursday night began much like the others, but it ended less happily. The whippoorwills in the glen had screamed with such unusual persistence that many could not sleep, and about 3 A.M. all the party telephones rang tremulously. Those who took down their receivers heard a fright-mad voice shriek out, “Help, oh, my Gawd! . . .” and some thought a crashing sound followed the breaking off of the exclamation. There was nothing more. No one dared do anything, and no one knew till morning whence the call came. Then those who had heard it called everyone on the line, and found that only the Fryes did not reply. The truth appeared an hour later, when a hastily assembled group of armed men trudged out to the Frye place at the head of the glen. It was horrible, yet hardly a surprise. There were more swaths and monstrous prints, but there was no longer any house. It had caved in like an egg-shell, and amongst the ruins nothing living or dead could be discovered. Only a stench and a tarry stickiness. The Elmer Fryes had been erased from Dunwich."]}
{"id": "EN010", "pair": ["II. An Antecedent and a Horror1.Joseph Curwen, as revealed by the rambling legends embodied in what Ward heard and unearthed, was a very astonishing, enigmatic, and obscurely horrible individual. He had fled from Salem to Providence - that universal haven of the odd, the free, and the dissenting - at the beginning of the great witchcraft panic; being in fear of accusation because of his solitary ways and queer chemical or alchemical experiments. He was a colourless-looking man of about thirty, and was soon found qualified to become a freeman of Providence; thereafter buying a home lot just north of Gregory Dexters at about the foot of Olney Street. His house was built on Stampers Hill west of the Town Street, in what later became Olney Court; and in 1761 he replaced this with a larger one, on the same site, which is still standing.      Now the first odd thing about Joseph Curwen was that he did not seem to grow much older than he had been on his arrival. He engaged in shipping enterprises, purchased wharfage near Mile-End Cove, helped rebuild the Great Bridge in 1713, and in 1723 was one of the founders of the Congregational Church on the hill; but always did he retain the nondescript aspect of a man not greatly over thirty or thirty-five. As decades mounted up, this singular quality began to excite wide notice; but Curwen always explained it by saying that he came of hardy forefathers, and practiced a simplicity of living which did not wear him out. How such simplicity could be reconciled with the inexplicable comings and goings of the secretive merchant, and with the queer gleaming of his windows at all hours of night, was not very clear to the townsfolk; and they were prone to assign other reasons for his continued youth and longevity. It was held, for the most part, that Curwens incessant mixings and boilings of chemicals had much to do with his condition. Gossip spoke of the strange substances he brought from London and the Indies on his ships or purchased in Newport, Boston, and New York; and when old Dr. Jabez Bowen came from Rehoboth and opened his apothecary shop across the Great Bridge at the Sign of the Unicorn and Mortar, there was ceaseless talk of the drugs, acids, and metals that the taciturn recluse incessantly bought or ordered from him. Acting on the assumption that Curwen possessed a wondrous and secret medical skill, many sufferers of various sorts applied to him for aid; but though he appeared to encourage their belief in a non-committal way, and always gave them odd-coloured potions in response to their requests, it was observed that his ministrations to others seldom proved of benefit. At length, when over fifty years had passed since the strangers advent, and without producing more than five years apparent change in his face and physique, the people began to whisper more darkly; and to meet more than half way that desire for isolation which he had always shewn.      Private letters and diaries of the period reveal, too, a multitude of other reasons why Joseph Curwen was marvelled at, feared, and finally shunned like a plague. His passion for graveyards, in which he was glimpsed at all hours and under all conditions, was notorious; though no one had witnessed any deed on his part which could actually be termed ghoulish. On the Pawtuxet Road he had a farm, at which he generally lived during the summer, and to which he would frequently be seen riding at various odd times of the day or night. Here his only visible servants, farmers, and caretakers were a sullen pair of aged Narragansett Indians; the husband dumb and curiously scarred, and the wife of a very repulsive cast of countenance, probably due to a mixture of negro blood. In the lean-to of this house was the laboratory where most of the chemical experiments were conducted. Curious porters and teamers who delivered bottles, bags, or boxes at the small rear door would exchange accounts of the fantastic flasks, crucibles, alembics, and furnaces they saw in the low shelved room; and prophesied in whispers that the close-mouthed \"chymist\" - by which they meant alchemist - would not be long in finding the Philosophers Stone. The nearest neighbours to this farm - the Fenners, a quarter of a mile away - had still queerer things to tell of certain sounds which they insisted came from the Curwen place in the night. There were cries, they said, and sustained howlings; and they did not like the large number of livestock which thronged the pastures, for no such amount was needed to keep a lone old man and a very few servants in meat, milk, and wool. The identity of the stock seemed to change from week to week as new droves were purchased from the Kingstown farmers. Then, too, there was something very obnoxious about a certain great stone outbuilding with only high narrow slits for windows.      Great Bridge idlers likewise had much to say of Curwens town house in Olney Court; not so much the fine new one built in 1761, when the man must have been nearly a century old, but the first low gambrel-roofed one with the windowless attic and shingled sides, whose timbers he took the peculiar precaution of burning after its demolition. Here there was less mystery, it is true; but the hours at which lights were seen, the secretiveness of the two swarthy foreigners who comprised the only menservants, the hideous indistinct mumbling of the incredibly aged French housekeeper, the large amounts of food seen to enter a door within which only four persons lived, and the quality of certain voices often heard in muffled conversation at highly unseasonable times, all combined with what was known of the Pawtuxet farm to give the place a bad name.      In choicer circles, too, the Curwen home was by no means undiscussed; for as the newcomer had gradually worked into the church and trading life of the town, he had naturally made acquaintances of the better sort, whose company and conversation he was well fitted by education to enjoy. His birth was known to be good, since the Curwens or Corwins of Salem needed no introduction in New England. It developed that Joseph Curwen had travelled much in very early life, living for a time in England and making at least two voyages to the Orient; and his speech, when he deigned to use it, was that of a learned and cultivated Englishman. But for some reason or other Curwen did not care for society. Whilst never actually rebuffing a visitor, he always reared such a wall of reserve that few could think of anything to say to him which would not sound inane.      There seemed to lurk in his bearing some cryptic, sardonic arrogance, as if he had come to find all human beings dull through having moved among stranger and more potent entities. When Dr. Checkley the famous wit came from Boston in 1738 to be rector of Kings Church, he did not neglect calling on one of whom he soon heard so much; but left in a very short while because of some sinister undercurrent he detected in his hosts discourse. Charles Ward told his father, when they discussed Curwen one winter evening, that he would give much to learn what the mysterious old man had said to the sprightly cleric, but that all diarists agree concerning Dr. Checkleys reluctance to repeat anything he had heard. The good man had been hideously shocked, and could never recall Joseph Curwen without a visible loss of the gay urbanity for which he was famed.      More definite, however, was the reason why another man of taste and breeding avoided the haughty hermit. In 1746 Mr. John Merritt, an elderly English gentleman of literary and scientific leanings, came from Newport to the town which was so rapidly overtaking it in standing, and built a fine country seat on the Neck in what is now the heart of the best residence section. He lived in considerable style and comfort, keeping the first coach and liveried servants in town, and taking great pride in his telescope, his microscope, and his well-chosen library of English and Latin books. Hearing of Curwen as the owner of the best library in Providence, Mr. Merritt early paid him a call, and was more cordially received than most other callers at the house had been. His admiration for his hosts ample shelves, which besides the Greek, Latin, and English classics were equipped with a remarkable battery of philosophical, mathematical, and scientific works including Paracelsus, Agricola, Van Helmont, Sylvius, Glauber, Boyle, Boerhaave, Becher, and Stahl, led Curwen to suggest a visit to the farmhouse and laboratory whither he had never invited anyone before; and the two drove out at once in Mr. Merritts coach.      Mr. Merritt always confessed to seeing nothing really horrible at the farmhouse, but maintained that the titles of the books in the special library of thaumaturgical, alchemical, and theological subjects which Curwen kept in a front room were alone sufficient to inspire him with a lasting loathing. Perhaps, however, the facial expression of the owner in exhibiting them contributed much of the prejudice. The bizarre collection, besides a host of standard works which Mr. Merritt was not too alarmed to envy, embraced nearly all the cabbalists, daemonologists, and magicians known to man; and was a treasure-house of lore in the doubtful realms of alchemy and astrology. Hermes Trismegistus in Mesnards edition, the Turba Philosophorum, Gebers Liber Investigationis, and Artephius Key of Wisdom all were there; with the cabbalistic Zohar, Peter Jammys set of Albertus Magnus, Raymond Lullys Ars Magna et Ultima in Zetzners edition, Roger Bacons Thesaurus Chemicus, Fludds Clavis Alchimiae, and Trithemius De Lapide Philosophico crowding them close. Mediaeval Jews and Arabs were represented in profusion, and Mr. Merritt turned pale when, upon taking down a fine volume conspicuously labelled as the Qanoon-e-Islam, he found it was in truth the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred, of which he had heard such monstrous things whispered some years previously after the exposure of nameless rites at the strange little fishing village of Kingsport, in the Province of the Massachusetts-Bay.      But oddly enough, the worthy gentleman owned himself most impalpably disquieted by a mere minor detail. On the huge mahogany table there lay face downward a badly worn copy of Borellus, bearing many cryptical marginalia and interlineations in Curwens hand. The book was open at about its middle, and one paragraph displayed such thick and tremulous pen-strokes beneath the lines of mystic black-letter that the visitor could not resist scanning it through. Whether it was the nature of the passage underscored, or the feverish heaviness of the strokes which formed the underscoring, he could not tell; but something in that combination affected him very badly and very peculiarly. He recalled it to the end of his days, writing it down from memory in his diary and once trying to recite it to his close friend Dr. Checkley till he saw how greatly it disturbed the urbane rector. It read:      \"The essential Saltes of Animals may be so prepared and preserved, that an ingenious Man may have the whole Ark of Noah in his own Studie, and raise the fine Shape of an Animal out of its Ashes at his Pleasure; and by the lyke Method from the essential Saltes of humane Dust, a Philosopher may, without any criminal Necromancy, call up the Shape of any dead Ancestour from the Dust whereinto his Bodie has been incinerated.\"      It was near the docks along the southerly part of the Town Street, however, that the worst things were muttered about Joseph Curwen. Sailors are superstitious folk; and the seasoned salts who manned the infinite rum, slave, and molasses sloops, the rakish privateers, and the great brigs of the Browns, Crawfords, and Tillinghasts, all made strange furtive signs of protection when they saw the slim, deceptively young-looking figure with its yellow hair and slight stoop entering the Curwen warehouse in Doubloon Street or talking with captains and supercargoes on the long quay where the Curwen ships rode restlessly. Curwens own clerks and captains hated and feared him, and all his sailors were mongrel riff-raff from Martinique, St. Eustatius, Havana, or Port Royal. It was, in a way, the frequency with which these sailors were replaced which inspired the acutest and most tangible part of the fear in which the old man was held. A crew would be turned loose in the town on shore leave, some of its members perhaps charged with this errand or that; and when reassembled it would be almost sure to lack one or more men. That many of the errands had concerned the farm on the Pawtuxet Road, and that few of the sailors had ever been seen to return from that place, was not forgotten; so that in time it became exceedingly difficult for Curwen to keep his oddly assorted hands. Almost invariably several would desert soon after hearing the gossip of the Providence wharves, and their replacement in the West Indies became an increasingly great problem to the merchant.      In 1760 Joseph Curwen was virtually an outcast, suspected of vague horrors and daemoniac alliances which seemed all the more menacing because they could not be named, understood, or even proved to exist. The last straw may have come from the affair of the missing soldiers in 1758, for in March and April of that year two Royal regiments on their way to New France were quartered in Providence, and depleted by an inexplicable process far beyond the average rate of desertion. Rumour dwelt on the frequency with which Curwen was wont to be seen talking with the red-coated strangers; and as several of them began to be missed, people thought of the odd conditions among his own seamen. What would have happened if the regiments had not been ordered on, no one can tell.      Meanwhile the merchants worldly affairs were prospering. He had a virtual monopoly of the towns trade in saltpetre, black pepper, and cinnamon, and easily led any other one shipping establishment save the Browns in his importation of brassware, indigo, cotton, woollens, salt, rigging, iron, paper, and English goods of every kind. Such shopkeepers as James Green, at the Sign of the Elephant in Cheapside, the Russells, at the Sign of the Golden Eagle across the Bridge, or Clark and Nightingale at the Frying-Pan and Fish near the New Coffee-House, depended almost wholly upon him for their stock; and his arrangements with the local distillers, the Narragansett dairymen and horse-breeders, and the Newport candle-makers, made him one of the prime exporters of the Colony.      Ostracised though he was, he did not lack for civic spirit of a sort. When the Colony House burned down, he subscribed handsomely to the lotteries by which the new brick one - still standing at the head of its parade in the old main street - was built in 1761. In that same year, too, he helped rebuild the Great Bridge after the October gale. He replaced many of the books of the public library consumed in the Colony House fire, and bought heavily in the lottery that gave the muddy Market Parade and deep-rutted Town Street their pavement of great round stones with a brick footwalk or \"causey\" in the middle. About this time, also, he built the plain but excellent new house whose doorway is still such a triumph of carving. When the Whitefield adherents broke off from Dr. Cottons hill church in 1743 and founded Deacon Snows church across the Bridge, Curwen had gone with them; though his zeal and attendance soon abated. Now, however, he cultivated piety once more; as if to dispel the shadow which had thrown him into isolation and would soon begin to wreck his business fortunes if not sharply checked.2.      The sight of this strange, pallid man, hardly middle-aged in aspect yet certainly not less than a full century old, seeking at last to emerge from a cloud of fright and detestation too vague to pin down or analyse, was at once a pathetic, a dramatic, and a contemptible thing. Such is the power of wealth and of surface gestures, however, that there came indeed a slight abatement in the visible aversion displayed toward him; especially after the rapid disappearances of his sailors abruptly ceased. He must likewise have begun to practice an extreme care and secrecy in his graveyard expeditions, for he was never again caught at such wanderings; whilst the rumours of uncanny sounds and manoeuvres at his Pawtuxet farm diminished in proportion. His rate of food consumption and cattle replacement remained abnormally high; but not until modern times, when Charles Ward examined a set of his accounts and invoices in the Shepley Library, did it occur to any person - save one embittered youth, perhaps - to make dark comparisons between the large number of Guinea blacks he imported until 1766, and the disturbingly small number for whom he could produce bona fide bills of sale either to slave-dealers at the Great Bridge or to the planters of the Narragansett Country. Certainly, the cunning and ingenuity of this abhorred character were uncannily profound, once the necessity for their exercise had become impressed upon him.      But of course the effect of all this belated mending was necessarily slight. Curwen continued to be avoided and distrusted, as indeed the one fact of his continued air of youth at a great age would have been enough to warrant; and he could see that in the end his fortunes would be likely to suffer. His elaborate studies and experiments, whatever they may have been, apparently required a heavy income for their maintenance; and since a change of environment would deprive him of the trading advantages he had gained, it would not have profited him to begin anew in a different region just then. Judgment demanded that he patch up his relations with the townsfolk of Providence, so that his presence might no longer be a signal for hushed conversation, transparent excuses of errands elsewhere, and a general atmosphere of constraint and uneasiness. His clerks, being now reduced to the shiftless and impecunious residue whom no one else would employ, were giving him much worry; and he held to his sea-captains and mates only by shrewdness in gaining some kind of ascendancy over them - a mortgage, a promissory note, or a bit of information very pertinent to their welfare. In many cases, diarists have recorded with some awe, Curwen shewed almost the power of a wizard in unearthing family secrets for questionable use. During the final five years of his life it seemed as though only direct talks with the long-dead could possibly have furnished some of the data which he had so glibly at his tongues end.      About this time the crafty scholar hit upon a last desperate expedient to regain his footing in the community. Hitherto a complete hermit, he now determined to contract an advantageous marriage; securing as a bride some lady whose unquestioned position would make all ostracism of his home impossible. It may be that he also had deeper reasons for wishing an alliance; reasons so far outside the known cosmic sphere that only papers found a century and a half after his death caused anyone to suspect them; but of this nothing certain can ever be learned. Naturally he was aware of the horror and indignation with which any ordinary courtship of his would be received, hence he looked about for some likely candidate upon whose parents he might exert a suitable pressure. Such candidates, he found, were not at all easy to discover; since he had very particular requirements in the way of beauty, accomplishments, and social security. At length his survey narrowed down to the household of one of his best and oldest ship-captains, a widower of high birth and unblemished standing named Dutee Tillinghast, whose only daughter Eliza seemed dowered with every conceivable advantage save prospects as an heiress. Capt. Tillinghast was completely under the domination of Curwen; and consented, after a terrible interview in his cupolaed house on Powers Lane hill, to sanction the blasphemous alliance.      Eliza Tillinghast was at that time eighteen years of age, and had been reared as gently as the reduced circumstances of her father permitted. She had attended Stephen Jacksons school opposite the Court-House Parade; and had been diligently instructed by her mother, before the latters death of smallpox in 1757, in all the arts and refinements of domestic life. A sampler of hers, worked in 1753 at the age of nine, may still be found in the rooms of the Rhode Island Historical Society. After her mothers death she had kept the house, aided only by one old black woman. Her arguments with her father concerning the proposed Curwen marriage must have been painful indeed; but of these we have no record. Certain it is that her engagement to young Ezra Weeden, second mate of the Crawford packet Enterprise, was dutifully broken off, and that her union with Joseph Curwen took place on the seventh of March, 1763, in the Baptist church, in the presence of one of the most distinguished assemblages which the town could boast; the ceremony being performed by the younger Samuel Winsor. The Gazette mentioned the event very briefly, and in most surviving copies the item in question seems to be cut or torn out. Ward found a single intact copy after much search in the archives of a private collector of note, observing with amusement the meaningless urbanity of the language:      \"Monday evening last, Mr. Joseph Curwen, of this Town, Merchant, was married to Miss Eliza Tillinghast, Daughter of Capt. Dutee Tillinghast, a young Lady who has real Merit, added to a beautiful Person, to grace the connubial State and perpetuate its Felicity.\"      The collection of Durfee-Arnold letters, discovered by Charles Ward shortly before his first reputed madness in the private collection of Melville F. Peters, Esq., of George St., and covering this and a somewhat antecedent period, throws vivid light on the outrage done to public sentiment by this ill-assorted match. The social influence of the Tillinghasts, however, was not to be denied; and once more Joseph Curwen found his house frequented by persons whom he could never otherwise have induced to cross his threshold. His acceptance was by no means complete, and his bride was socially the sufferer through her forced venture; but at all events the wall of utter ostracism was somewhat worn down. In his treatment of his wife the strange bridegroom astonished both her and the community by displaying an extreme graciousness and consideration. The new house in Olney Court was now wholly free from disturbing manifestations, and although Curwen was much absent at the Pawtuxet farm which his wife never visited, he seemed more like a normal citizen than at any other time in his long years of residence. Only one person remained in open enmity with him, this being the youthful ships officer whose engagement to Eliza Tillinghast had been so abruptly broken. Ezra Weeden had frankly vowed vengeance; and though of a quiet and ordinarily mild disposition, was now gaining a hate-bred, dogged purpose which boded no good to the usurping husband.      On the seventh of May, 1765, Curwens only child Ann was born; and was christened by the Rev. John Graves of Kings Church, of which both husband and wife had become communicants shortly after their marriage, in order to compromise between their respective Congregational and Baptist affiliations. The record of this birth, as well as that of the marriage two years before, was stricken from most copies of the church and town annals where it ought to appear; and Charles Ward located both with the greatest difficulty after his discovery of the widows change of name had apprised him of his own relationship, and engendered the feverish interest which culminated in his madness. The birth entry, indeed, was found very curiously through correspondence with the heirs of the loyalist Dr. Graves, who had taken with him a duplicate set of records when he left his pastorate at the outbreak of the Revolution. Ward had tried this source because he knew that his great-great-grandmother Ann Tillinghast Potter had been an Episcopalian.      Shortly after the birth of his daughter, an event he seemed to welcome with a fervour greatly out of keeping with his usual coldness, Curwen resolved to sit for a portrait. This he had painted by a very gifted Scotsman named Cosmo Alexander, then a resident of Newport, and since famous as the early teacher of Gilbert Stuart. The likeness was said to have been executed on a wall-panel of the library of the house in Olney Court, but neither of the two old diaries mentioning it gave any hint of its ultimate disposition. At this period the erratic scholar shewed signs of unusual abstraction, and spent as much time as he possibly could at his farm on the Pawtuxet Road. He seemed, it was stated, in a condition of suppressed excitement or suspense; as if expecting some phenomenal thing or on the brink of some strange discovery. Chemistry or alchemy would appear to have played a great part, for he took from his house to the farm the greater number of his volumes on that subject.      His affectation of civic interest did not diminish, and he lost no opportunities for helping such leaders as Stephen Hopkins, Joseph Brown, and Benjamin West in their efforts to raise the cultural tone of the town, which was then much below the level of Newport in its patronage of the liberal arts. He had helped Daniel Jenckes found his bookshop in 1763, and was thereafter his best customer; extending aid likewise to the struggling Gazette that appeared each Wednesday at the Sign of Shakespears Head. In politics he ardently supported Governor Hopkins against the Ward party whose prime strength was in Newport, and his really eloquent speech at Hackers Hall in 1765 against the setting off of North Providence as a separate town with a pro-Ward vote in the General Assembly did more than any other one thing to wear down the prejudice against him. But Ezra Weeden, who watched him closely, sneered cynically at all this outward activity; and freely swore it was no more than a mask for some nameless traffick with the blackest gulfs of Tartarus. The revengeful youth began a systematic study of the man and his doings whenever he was in port; spending hours at night by the wharves with a dory in readiness when he saw lights in the Curwen warehouses, and following the small boat which would sometimes steal quietly off and down the bay. He also kept as close a watch as possible on the Pawtuxet farm, and was once severely bitten by the dogs the old Indian couple loosed upon him.3.      In 1766 came the final change in Joseph Curwen. It was very sudden, and gained wide notice amongst the curious townsfolk; for the air of suspense and expectancy dropped like an old cloak, giving instant place to an ill-concealed exaltation of perfect triumph. Curwen seemed to have difficulty in restraining himself from public harangues on what he had found or learned or made; but apparently the need of secrecy was greater than the longing to share his rejoicing, for no explanation was ever offered by him. It was after this transition, which appears to have come early in July, that the sinister scholar began to astonish people by his possession of information which only their long-dead ancestors would seem to be able to impart.      But Curwens feverish secret activities by no means ceased with this change. On the contrary, they tended rather to increase; so that more and more of his shipping business was handled by the captains whom he now bound to him by ties of fear as potent as those of bankruptcy had been. He altogether abandoned the slave trade, alleging that its profits were constantly decreasing. Every possible moment was spent at the Pawtuxet farm; though there were rumours now and then of his presence in places which, though not actually near graveyards, were yet so situated in relation to graveyards that thoughtful people wondered just how thorough the old merchants change of habits really was. Ezra Weeden, though his periods of espionage were necessarily brief and intermittent on account of his sea voyaging, had a vindictive persistence which the bulk of the practical townsfolk and farmers lacked; and subjected Curwens affairs to a scrutiny such as they had never had before.      Many of the odd manoeuvres of the strange merchants vessels had been taken for granted on account of the unrest of the times, when every colonist seemed determined to resist the provisions of the Sugar Act which hampered a prominent traffick. Smuggling and evasion were the rule in Narragansett Bay, and nocturnal landings of illicit cargoes were continuous commonplaces. But Weeden, night after night following the lighters or small sloops which he saw steal off from the Curwen warehouses at the Town Street docks, soon felt assured that it was not merely His Majestys armed ships which the sinister skulker was anxious to avoid. Prior to the change in 1766 these boats had for the most part contained chained negroes, who were carried down and across the bay and landed at an obscure point on the shore just north of Pawtuxet; being afterward driven up the bluff and across country to the Curwen farm, where they were locked in that enormous stone outbuilding which had only high narrow slits for windows. After that change, however, the whole programme was altered. Importation of slaves ceased at once, and for a time Curwen abandoned his midnight sailings. Then, about the spring of 1767, a new policy appeared. Once more the lighters grew wont to put out from the black, silent docks, and this time they would go down the bay some distance, perhaps as far as Namquit Point, where they would meet and receive cargo from strange ships of considerable size and widely varied appearance. Curwens sailors would then deposit this cargo at the usual point on the shore, and transport it overland to the farm; locking it in the same cryptical stone building which had formerly received the negroes. The cargo consisted almost wholly of boxes and cases, of which a large proportion were oblong and heavy and disturbingly suggestive of coffins.      Weeden always watched the farm with unremitting assiduity; visiting it each night for long periods, and seldom letting a week go by without a sight except when the ground bore a footprint-revealing snow. Even then he would often walk as close as possible in the travelled road or on the ice of the neighbouring river to see what tracks others might have left. Finding his own vigils interrupted by nautical duties, he hired a tavern companion named Eleazar Smith to continue the survey during his absences; and between them the two could have set in motion some extraordinary rumours. That they did not do so was only because they knew the effect of publicity would be to warn their quarry and make further progress impossible. Instead, they wished to learn something definite before taking any action. What they did learn must have been startling indeed, and Charles Ward spoke many times to his parents of his regret at Weedens later burning of his notebooks. All that can be told of their discoveries is what Eleazar Smith jotted down in a none too coherent diary, and what other diarists and letter-writers have timidly repeated from the statements which they finally made - and according to which the farm was only the outer shell of some vast and revolting menace, of a scope and depth too profound and intangible for more than shadowy comprehension.      It is gathered that Weeden and Smith became early convinced that a great series of tunnels and catacombs, inhabited by a very sizeable staff of persons besides the old Indian and his wife, underlay the farm. The house was an old peaked relic of the middle seventeenth century with enormous stack chimney and diamond-paned lattice windows, the laboratory being in a lean-to toward the north, where the roof came nearly to the ground. This building stood clear of any other; yet judging by the different voices heard at odd times within, it must have been accessible through secret passages beneath. These voices, before 1766, were mere mumblings and negro whisperings and frenzied screams, coupled with curious chants or invocations. After that date, however, they assumed a very singular and terrible cast as they ran the gamut betwixt dronings of dull acquiescence and explosions of frantic pain or fury, rumblings of conversation and whines of entreaty, pantings of eagerness and shouts of protest. They appeared to be in different languages, all known to Curwen, whose rasping accents were frequently distinguishable in reply, reproof, or threatening. Sometimes it seemed that several persons must be in the house; Curwen, certain captives, and the guards of those captives. There were voices of a sort that neither Weeden nor Smith had ever heard before despite their wide knowledge of foreign parts, and many that they did seem to place as belonging to this or that nationality. The nature of the conversations seemed always a kind of catechism, as if Curwen were extorting some sort of information from terrified or rebellious prisoners.      Weeden had many verbatim reports of overheard scraps in his notebook, for English, French, and Spanish, which he knew, were frequently used; but of these nothing has survived. He did, however, say that besides a few ghoulish dialogues in which the past affairs of Providence families were concerned, most of the questions and answers he could understand were historical or scientific; occasionally pertaining to very remote places and ages. Once, for example, an alternately raging and sullen figure was questioned in French about the Black Princes massacre at Limoges in 1370, as if there were some hidden reason which he ought to know. Curwen asked the prisoner - if prisoner it were - whether the order to slay was given because of the Sign of the Goat found on the altar in the ancient Roman crypt beneath the Cathedral, or whether the Dark Man of the Haute Vienne Coven had spoken the Three Words. Failing to obtain replies, the inquisitor had seemingly resorted to extreme means; for there was a terrific shriek followed by silence and muttering and a bumping sound.      None of these colloquies were ever ocularly witnessed, since the windows were always heavily draped. Once, though, during a discourse in an unknown tongue, a shadow was seen on the curtain which startled Weeden exceedingly; reminding him of one of the puppets in a show he had seen in the autumn of 1764 in Hackers Hall, when a man from Germantown, Pennsylvania, had given a clever mechanical spectacle advertised as a \"View of the Famous City of Jerusalem, in which are represented Jerusalem, the Temple of Solomon, his Royal Throne, the noted Towers, and Hills, likewise the Sufferings of Our Saviour from the Garden of Gethsemane to the Cross on the Hill of Golgotha; an artful piece of Statuary, Worthy to be seen by the Curious.\" It was on this occasion that the listener, who had crept close to the window of the front room whence the speaking proceeded, gave a start which roused the old Indian pair and caused them to loose the dogs on him. After that no more conversations were ever heard in the house, and Weeden and Smith concluded that Curwen had transferred his field of action to regions below.      That such regions in truth existed, seemed amply clear from many things. Faint cries and groans unmistakably came up now and then from what appeared to be the solid earth in places far from any structure; whilst hidden in the bushes along the river-bank in the rear, where the high ground sloped steeply down to the valley of the Pawtuxet, there was found an arched oaken door in a frame of heavy masonry, which was obviously an entrance to caverns within the hill. When or how these catacombs could have been constructed, Weeden was unable to say; but he frequently pointed out how easily the place might have been reached by bands of unseen workmen from the river. Joseph Curwen put his mongrel seamen to diverse uses indeed! During the heavy spring rains of 1769 the two watchers kept a sharp eye on the steep river-bank to see if any subterrene secrets might be washed to light, and were rewarded by the sight of a profusion of both human and animal bones in places where deep gullies had been worn in the banks. Naturally there might be many explanations of such things in the rear of a stock farm, and in a locality where old Indian burying-grounds were common, but Weeden and Smith drew their own inferences.      It was in January 1770, whilst Weeden and Smith were still debating vainly on what, if anything, to think or do about the whole bewildering business, that the incident of the Fortaleza occurred. Exasperated by the burning of the revenue sloop Liberty at Newport during the previous summer, the customs fleet under Admiral Wallace had adopted an increased vigilance concerning strange vessels; and on this occasion His Majestys armed schooner Cygnet, under Capt. Charles Leslie, captured after a short pursuit one early morning the snow Fortaleza of Barcelona, Spain, under Capt. Manuel Arruda, bound according to its log from Grand Cairo, Egypt, to Providence. When searched for contraband material, this ship revealed the astonishing fact that its cargo consisted exclusively of Egyptian mummies, consigned to \"Sailor A. B. C.\", who would come to remove his goods in a lighter just off Namquit Point and whose identity Capt. Arruda felt himself in honour bound not to reveal. The Vice-Admiralty Court at Newport, at a loss what to do in view of the non-contraband nature of the cargo on the one hand and of the unlawful secrecy of the entry on the other hand, compromised on Collector Robinsons recommendation by freeing the ship but forbidding it a port in Rhode Island waters. There were later rumours of its having been seen in Boston Harbour, though it never openly entered the Port of Boston.      This extraordinary incident did not fail of wide remark in Providence, and there were not many who doubted the existence of some connexion between the cargo of mummies and the sinister Joseph Curwen. His exotic studies and his curious chemical importations being common knowledge, and his fondness for graveyards being common suspicion; it did not take much imagination to link him with a freakish importation which could not conceivably have been destined for anyone else in the town. As if conscious of this natural belief, Curwen took care to speak casually on several occasions of the chemical value of the balsams found in mummies; thinking perhaps that he might make the affair seem less unnatural, yet stopping just short of admitting his participation. Weeden and Smith, of course, felt no doubt whatsoever of the significance of the thing; and indulged in the wildest theories concerning Curwen and his monstrous labours.      The following spring, like that of the year before, had heavy rains; and the watchers kept careful track of the river-bank behind the Curwen farm. Large sections were washed away, and a certain number of bones discovered; but no glimpse was afforded of any actual subterranean chambers or burrows. Something was rumoured, however, at the village of Pawtuxet about a mile below, where the river flows in falls over a rocky terrace to join the placid landlocked cove. There, where quaint old cottages climbed the hill from the rustic bridge, and fishing-smacks lay anchored at their sleepy docks, a vague report went round of things that were floating down the river and flashing into sight for a minute as they went over the falls. Of course the Pawtuxet is a long river which winds through many settled regions abounding in graveyards, and of course the spring rains had been very heavy; but the fisherfolk about the bridge did not like the wild way that one of the things stared as it shot down to the still water below, or the way that another half cried out although its condition had greatly departed from that of objects which normally cry out. That rumour sent Smith - for Weeden was just then at sea - in haste to the river-bank behind the farm; where surely enough there remained the evidences of an extensive cave-in. There was, however, no trace of a passage into the steep bank; for the miniature avalanche had left behind a solid wall of mixed earth and shrubbery from aloft. Smith went to the extent of some experimental digging, but was deterred by lack of success - or perhaps by fear of possible success. It is interesting to speculate on what the persistent and revengeful Weeden would have done had he been ashore at the time.4.      By the autumn of 1770 Weeden decided that the time was ripe to tell others of his discoveries; for he had a large number of facts to link together, and a second eye-witness to refute the possible charge that jealousy and vindictiveness had spurred his fancy. As his first confidant he selected Capt. James Mathewson of the Enterprise, who on the one hand knew him well enough not to doubt his veracity, and on the other hand was sufficiently influential in the town to be heard in turn with respect. The colloquy took place in an upper room of Sabins Tavern near the docks, with Smith present to corroborate virtually every statement; and it could be seen that Capt. Mathewson was tremendously impressed. Like nearly everyone else in the town, he had had black suspicions of his own anent Joseph Curwen; hence it needed only this confirmation and enlargement of data to convince him absolutely. At the end of the conference he was very grave, and enjoined strict silence upon the two younger men. He would, he said, transmit the information separately to some ten or so of the most learned and prominent citizens of Providence; ascertaining their views and following whatever advice they might have to offer. Secrecy would probably be essential in any case, for this was no matter that the town constables or militia could cope with; and above all else the excitable crowd must be kept in ignorance, lest there be enacted in these already troublous times a repetition of that frightful Salem panic of less than a century before which had first brought Curwen hither.      The right persons to tell, he believed, would be Dr. Benjamin West, whose pamphlet on the late transit of Venus proved him a scholar and keen thinker; Rev. James Manning, President of the College which had just moved up from Warren and was temporarily housed in the new King Street schoolhouse awaiting the completion of its building on the hill above Presbyterian-Lane; ex-Governor Stephen Hopkins, who had been a member of the Philosophical Society at Newport, and was a man of very broad perceptions; John Carter, publisher of the Gazette; all four of the Brown brothers, John, Joseph, Nicholas, and Moses, who formed the recognised local magnates, and of whom Joseph was an amateur scientist of parts; old Dr. Jabez Bowen, whose erudition was considerable, and who had much first-hand knowledge of Curwens odd purchases; and Capt. Abraham Whipple, a privateersman of phenomenal boldness and energy who could be counted on to lead in any active measures needed. These men, if favourable, might eventually be brought together for collective deliberation; and with them would rest the responsibility of deciding whether or not to inform the Governor of the Colony, Joseph Wanton of Newport, before taking action.      The mission of Capt. Mathewson prospered beyond his highest expectations; for whilst he found one or two of the chosen confidants somewhat sceptical of the possible ghastly side of Weedens tale, there was not one who did not think it necessary to take some sort of secret and cordinated action. Curwen, it was clear, formed a vague potential menace to the welfare of the town and Colony; and must be eliminated at any cost. Late in December 1770 a group of eminent townsmen met at the home of Stephen Hopkins and debated tentative measures. Weedens notes, which he had given to Capt. Mathewson, were carefully read; and he and Smith were summoned to give testimony anent details. Something very like fear seized the whole assemblage before the meeting was over, though there ran through that fear a grim determination which Capt. Whipples bluff and resonant profanity best expressed. They would not notify the Governor, because a more than legal course seemed necessary. With hidden powers of uncertain extent apparently at his disposal, Curwen was not a man who could safely be warned to leave town. Nameless reprisals might ensue, and even if the sinister creature complied, the removal would be no more than the shifting of an unclean burden to another place. The times were lawless, and men who had flouted the Kings revenue forces for years were not the ones to balk at sterner things when duty impelled. Curwen must be surprised at his Pawtuxet farm by a large raiding-party of seasoned privateersmen and given one decisive chance to explain himself. If he proved a madman, amusing himself with shrieks and imaginary conversations in different voices, he would be properly confined. If something graver appeared, and if the underground horrors indeed turned out to be real, he and all with him must die. It could be done quietly, and even the widow and her father need not be told how it came about.      While these serious steps were under discussion there occurred in the town an incident so terrible and inexplicable that for a time little else was mentioned for miles around. In the middle of a moonlight January night with heavy snow underfoot there resounded over the river and up the hill a shocking series of cries which brought sleepy heads to every window; and people around Weybosset Point saw a great white thing plunging frantically along the badly cleared space in front of the Turks Head. There was a baying of dogs in the distance, but this subsided as soon as the clamour of the awakened town became audible. Parties of men with lanterns and muskets hurried out to see what was happening, but nothing rewarded their search. The next morning, however, a giant, muscular body, stark naked, was found on the jams of ice around the southern piers of the Great Bridge, where the Long Dock stretched out beside Abbotts distil-house, and the identity of this object became a theme for endless speculation and whispering. It was not so much the younger as the older folk who whispered, for only in the patriarchs did that rigid face with horror-bulging eyes strike any chord of memory. They, shaking as they did so, exchanged furtive murmurs of wonder and fear; for in those stiff, hideous features lay a resemblance so marvellous as to be almost an identity - and that identity was with a man who had died full fifty years before.      Ezra Weeden was present at the finding; and remembering the baying of the night before, set out along Weybosset Street and across Muddy Dock Bridge whence the sound had come. He had a curious expectancy, and was not surprised when, reaching the edge of the settled district where the street merged into the Pawtuxet Road, he came upon some very curious tracks in the snow. The naked giant had been pursued by dogs and many booted men, and the returning tracks of the hounds and their masters could be easily traced. They had given up the chase upon coming too near the town. Weeden smiled grimly, and as a perfunctory detail traced the footprints back to their source. It was the Pawtuxet farm of Joseph Curwen, as he well knew it would be; and he would have given much had the yard been less confusingly trampled. As it was, he dared not seem too interested in full daylight. Dr. Bowen, to whom Weeden went at once with his report, performed an autopsy on the strange corpse, and discovered peculiarities which baffled him utterly. The digestive tracts of the huge man seemed never to have been in use, whilst the whole skin had a coarse, loosely knit texture impossible to account for. Impressed by what the old men whispered of this bodys likeness to the long-dead blacksmith Daniel Green, whose great-grandson Aaron Hoppin was a supercargo in Curwens employ, Weeden asked casual questions till he found where Green was buried. That night a party of ten visited the old North Burying Ground opposite Herrendens Lane and opened a grave. They found it vacant, precisely as they had expected.      Meanwhile arrangements had been made with the post riders to intercept Joseph Curwens mail, and shortly before the incident of the naked body there was found a letter from one Jedediah Orne of Salem which made the coperating citizens think deeply. Parts of it, copied and preserved in the private archives of the Smith family where Charles Ward found it, ran as follows:      \"I delight that you continue in ye Gettg at Olde Matters in your Way, and doe not think better was done at Mr. Hutchinsons in Salem-Village. Certainely, there was Nothg butt ye liveliest Awfulness in that which H. raisd upp from What he coud gather onlie a part of. What you sente, did not Worke, whether because of Any Thing missg, or because ye Wordes were not Righte from my Speakg or yr Copyg. I alone am at a Loss. I have not ye Chymicall art to followe Borellus, and owne my Self confounded by ye VII. Booke of ye Necronomicon that you recommende. But I woud have you Observe what was tolde to us aboute takg Care whom to calle up, for you are Sensible what Mr. Mather writ in ye Magnalia of  -  - , and can judge how truely that Horrendous thing is reported. I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe; by the Which I meane, Any that can in Turne call up somewhat against you, whereby your Powerfullest Devices may not be of use. Ask of the Lesser, lest the Greater shall not wish to Answer, and shall commande more than you. I was frighted when I read of your knowg what Ben Zariatnatmik hadde in his ebony Boxe, for I was conscious who must have tolde you. And againe I ask that you shalle write me as Jedediah and not Simon. In this Community a Man may not live too long, and you knowe my Plan by which I came back as my Son. I am desirous you will Acquaint me with what ye Blacke Man learnt from Sylvanus Cocidius in ye Vault, under ye Roman Wall, and will be obligd for ye Lendg of ye MS. you speak of.\"      Another and unsigned letter from Philadelphia provoked equal thought, especially for the following passage:      \"I will observe what you say respecting the sending of Accounts only by yr Vessels, but can not always be certain when to expect them. In the Matter spoke of, I require onlie one more thing; but wish to be sure I apprehend you exactly. You inform me, that no Part must be missing if the finest Effects are to be had, but you can not but know how hard it is to be sure. It seems a great Hazard and Burthen to take away the whole Box, and in Town (i.e. St. Peters, St. Pauls, St. Marys, or Christ Church) it can scarce be done at all. But I know what Imperfections were in the one I raisd up October last, and how many live Specimens you were forcd to imploy before you hit upon the right Mode in the year 1766; so will be guided by you in all Matters. I am impatient for yr Brig, and inquire daily at Mr. Biddles Wharf.\"      A third suspicious letter was in an unknown tongue and even an unknown alphabet. In the Smith diary found by Charles Ward a single oft-repeated combination of characters is clumsily copied; and authorities at Brown University have pronounced the alphabet Amharic or Abyssinian, although they do not recognise the word. None of these epistles was ever delivered to Curwen, though the disappearance of Jedediah Orne from Salem as recorded shortly afterward shewed that the Providence men took certain quiet steps. The Pennsylvania Historical Society also has some curious letters received by Dr. Shippen regarding the presence of an unwholesome character in Philadelphia. But more decisive steps were in the air, and it is in the secret assemblages of sworn and tested sailors and faithful old privateersmen in the Brown warehouses by night that we must look for the main fruits of Weedens disclosures. Slowly and surely a plan of campaign was under development which would leave no trace of Joseph Curwens noxious mysteries.      Curwen, despite all precautions, apparently felt that something was in the wind; for he was now remarked to wear an unusually worried look. His coach was seen at all hours in the town and on the Pawtuxet Road, and he dropped little by little the air of forced geniality with which he had latterly sought to combat the towns prejudice. The nearest neighbours to his farm, the Fenners, one night remarked a great shaft of light shooting into the sky from some aperture in the roof of that cryptical stone building with the high, excessively narrow windows; an event which they quickly communicated to John Brown in Providence. Mr. Brown had become the executive leader of the select group bent on Curwens extirpation, and had informed the Fenners that some action was about to be taken. This he deemed needful because of the impossibility of their not witnessing the final raid; and he explained his course by saying that Curwen was known to be a spy of the customs officers at Newport, against whom the hand of every Providence shipper, merchant, and farmer was openly or clandestinely raised. Whether the ruse was wholly believed by neighbours who had seen so many queer things is not certain; but at any rate the Fenners were willing to connect any evil with a man of such queer ways. To them Mr. Brown had entrusted the duty of watching the Curwen farmhouse, and of regularly reporting every incident which took place there.5.      The probability that Curwen was on guard and attempting unusual things, as suggested by the odd shaft of light, precipitated at last the action so carefully devised by the band of serious citizens. According to the Smith diary a company of about 100 men met at 10 p.m. on Friday, April 12th, 1771, in the great room of Thurstons Tavern at the Sign of the Golden Lion on Weybosset Point across the Bridge. Of the guiding group of prominent men in addition to the leader John Brown there were present Dr. Bowen, with his case of surgical instruments, President Manning without the great periwig (the largest in the Colonies) for which he was noted, Governor Hopkins, wrapped in his dark cloak and accompanied by his seafaring brother Esek, whom he had initiated at the last moment with the permission of the rest, John Carter, Capt. Mathewson, and Capt. Whipple, who was to lead the actual raiding party. These chiefs conferred apart in a rear chamber, after which Capt. Whipple emerged to the great room and gave the gathered seamen their last oaths and instructions. Eleazar Smith was with the leaders as they sat in the rear apartment awaiting the arrival of Ezra Weeden, whose duty was to keep track of Curwen and report the departure of his coach for the farm.      About 10:30 a heavy rumble was heard on the Great Bridge, followed by the sound of a coach in the street outside; and at that hour there was no need of waiting for Weeden in order to know that the doomed man had set out for his last night of unhallowed wizardry. A moment later, as the receding coach clattered faintly over the Muddy Dock Bridge, Weeden appeared; and the raiders fell silently into military order in the street, shouldering the firelocks, fowling-pieces, or whaling harpoons which they had with them. Weeden and Smith were with the party, and of the deliberating citizens there were present for active service Capt. Whipple, the leader, Capt. Esek Hopkins, John Carter, President Manning, Capt. Mathewson, and Dr. Bowen; together with Moses Brown, who had come up at the eleventh hour though absent from the preliminary session in the tavern. All these freemen and their hundred sailors began the long march without delay, grim and a trifle apprehensive as they left the Muddy Dock behind and mounted the gentle rise of Broad Street toward the Pawtuxet Road. Just beyond Elder Snows church some of the men turned back to take a parting look at Providence lying outspread under the early spring stars. Steeples and gables rose dark and shapely, and salt breezes swept up gently from the cove north of the Bridge. Vega was climbing above the great hill across the water, whose crest of trees was broken by the roof-line of the unfinished College edifice. At the foot of that hill, and along the narrow mounting lanes of its side, the old town dreamed; Old Providence, for whose safety and sanity so monstrous and colossal a blasphemy was about to be wiped out.      An hour and a quarter later the raiders arrived, as previously agreed, at the Fenner farmhouse; where they heard a final report on their intended victim. He had reached his farm over half an hour before, and the strange light had soon afterward shot once into the sky, but there were no lights in any visible windows. This was always the case of late. Even as this news was given another great glare arose toward the south, and the party realised that they had indeed come close to the scene of awesome and unnatural wonders. Capt. Whipple now ordered his force to separate into three divisions; one of twenty men under Eleazar Smith to strike across to the shore and guard the landing-place against possible reinforcements for Curwen until summoned by a messenger for desperate service, a second of twenty men under Capt. Esek Hopkins to steal down into the river valley behind the Curwen farm and demolish with axes or gunpowder the oaken door in the high, steep bank, and the third to close in on the house and adjacent buildings themselves. Of this division one third was to be led by Capt. Mathewson to the cryptical stone edifice with high narrow windows, another third to follow Capt. Whipple himself to the main farmhouse, and the remaining third to preserve a circle around the whole group of buildings until summoned by a final emergency signal.      The river party would break down the hillside door at the sound of a single whistle-blast, then waiting and capturing anything which might issue from the regions within. At the sound of two whistle-blasts it would advance through the aperture to oppose the enemy or join the rest of the raiding contingent. The party at the stone building would accept these respective signals in an analogous manner; forcing an entrance at the first, and at the second descending whatever passage into the ground might be discovered, and joining the general or focal warfare expected to take place within the caverns. A third or emergency signal of three blasts would summon the immediate reserve from its general guard duty; its twenty men dividing equally and entering the unknown depths through both farmhouse and stone building. Capt. Whipples belief in the existence of catacombs was absolute, and he took no alternative into consideration when making his plans. He had with him a whistle of great power and shrillness, and did not fear any upsetting or misunderstanding of signals. The final reserve at the landing, of course, was nearly out of the whistles range; hence would require a special messenger if needed for help. Moses Brown and John Carter went with Capt. Hopkins to the river-bank, while President Manning was detailed with Capt. Mathewson to the stone building. Dr. Bowen, with Ezra Weeden, remained in Capt. Whipples party which was to storm the farmhouse itself. The attack was to begin as soon as a messenger from Capt. Hopkins had joined Capt. Whipple to notify him of the river partys readiness. The leader would then deliver the loud single blast, and the various advance parties would commence their simultaneous attack on three points. Shortly before 1 a.m. the three divisions left the Fenner farmhouse; one to guard the landing, another to seek the river valley and the hillside door, and the third to subdivide and attend to the actual buildings of the Curwen farm.      Eleazar Smith, who accompanied the shore-guarding party, records in his diary an uneventful march and a long wait on the bluff by the bay; broken once by what seemed to be the distant sound of the signal whistle and again by a peculiar muffled blend of roaring and crying and a powder blast which seemed to come from the same direction. Later on one man thought he caught some distant gunshots, and still later Smith himself felt the throb of titanic and thunderous words resounding in upper air. It was just before dawn that a single haggard messenger with wild eyes and a hideous unknown odour about his clothing appeared and told the detachment to disperse quietly to their homes and never again think or speak of the nights doings or of him who had been Joseph Curwen. Something about the bearing of the messenger carried a conviction which his mere words could never have conveyed; for though he was a seaman well known to many of them, there was something obscurely lost or gained in his soul which set him for evermore apart. It was the same later on when they met other old companions who had gone into that zone of horror. Most of them had lost or gained something imponderable and indescribable. They had seen or heard or felt something which was not for human creatures, and could not forget it. From them there was never any gossip, for to even the commonest of mortal instincts there are terrible boundaries. And from that single messenger the party at the shore caught a nameless awe which almost sealed their own lips. Very few are the rumours which ever came from any of them, and Eleazar Smiths diary is the only written record which has survived from that whole expedition which set forth from the Sign of the Golden Lion under the stars.      Charles Ward, however, discovered another vague sidelight in some Fenner correspondence which he found in New London, where he knew another branch of the family had lived. It seems that the Fenners, from whose house the doomed farm was distantly visible, had watched the departing columns of raiders; and had heard very clearly the angry barking of the Curwen dogs, followed by the first shrill blast which precipitated the attack. This blast had been followed by a repetition of the great shaft of light from the stone building, and in another moment, after a quick sounding of the second signal ordering a general invasion, there had come a subdued prattle of musketry followed by a horrible roaring cry which the correspondent Luke Fenner had represented in his epistle by the characters \"Waaaahrrrrr - Rwaaahrrr\". This cry, however, had possessed a quality which no mere writing could convey, and the correspondent mentions that his mother fainted completely at the sound. It was later repeated less loudly, and further but more muffled evidences of gunfire ensued; together with a loud explosion of powder from the direction of the river. About an hour afterward all the dogs began to bark frightfully, and there were vague ground rumblings so marked that the candlesticks tottered on the mantelpiece. A strong smell of sulphur was noted; and Luke Fenners father declared that he heard the third or emergency whistle signal, though the others failed to detect it. Muffled musketry sounded again, followed by a deep scream less piercing but even more horrible than those which had preceded it; a kind of throaty, nastily plastic cough or gurgle whose quality as a scream must have come more from its continuity and psychological import than from its actual acoustic value.      Then the flaming thing burst into sight at a point where the Curwen farm ought to lie, and the human cries of desperate and frightened men were heard. Muskets flashed and cracked, and the flaming thing fell to the ground. A second flaming thing appeared, and a shriek of human origin was plainly distinguished. Fenner wrote that he could even gather a few words belched in frenzy: \"Almighty, protect thy lamb!\" Then there were more shots, and the second flaming thing fell. After that came silence for about three-quarters of an hour; at the end of which time little Arthur Fenner, Lukes brother, exclaimed that he saw a red fog going up to the stars from the accursed farm in the distance. No one but the child can testify to this, but Luke admits the significant coincidence implied by the panic of almost convulsive fright which at the same moment arched the backs and stiffened the fur of the three cats then within the room.      Five minutes later a chill wind blew up, and the air became suffused with such an intolerable stench that only the strong freshness of the sea could have prevented its being noticed by the shore party or by any wakeful souls in Pawtuxet village. This stench was nothing which any of the Fenners had ever encountered before, and produced a kind of clutching, amorphous fear beyond that of the tomb or the charnel-house. Close upon it came the awful voice which no hapless hearer will ever be able to forget. It thundered out of the sky like a doom, and windows rattled as its echoes died away. It was deep and musical; powerful as a bass organ, but evil as the forbidden books of the Arabs. What it said no man can tell, for it spoke in an unknown tongue, but this is the writing Luke Fenner set down to portray the daemoniac intonations: \"DEESMEES-JESHET-BONE DOSEFE DUVEMA-ENITEMOSS\". Not till the year 1919 did any soul link this crude transcript with anything else in mortal knowledge, but Charles Ward paled as he recognised what Mirandola had denounced in shudders as the ultimate horror among black magics incantations.      An unmistakably human shout or deep chorused scream seemed to answer this malign wonder from the Curwen farm, after which the unknown stench grew complex with an added odour equally intolerable. A wailing distinctly different from the scream now burst out, and was protracted ululantly in rising and falling paroxysms. At times it became almost articulate, though no auditor could trace any definite words; and at one point it seemed to verge toward the confines of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Then a yell of utter, ultimate fright and stark madness wrenched from scores of human throats - a yell which came strong and clear despite the depth from which it must have burst; after which darkness and silence ruled all things. Spirals of acrid smoke ascended to blot out the stars, though no flames appeared and no buildings were observed to be gone or injured on the following day.      Toward dawn two frightened messengers with monstrous and unplaceable odours saturating their clothing knocked at the Fenner door and requested a keg of rum, for which they paid very well indeed. One of them told the family that the affair of Joseph Curwen was over, and that the events of the night were not to be mentioned again. Arrogant as the order seemed, the aspect of him who gave it took away all resentment and lent it a fearsome authority; so that only these furtive letters of Luke Fenner, which he urged his Connecticut relative to destroy, remain to tell what was seen and heard. The non-compliance of that relative, whereby the letters were saved after all, has alone kept the matter from a merciful oblivion. Charles Ward had one detail to add as a result of a long canvass of Pawtuxet residents for ancestral traditions. Old Charles Slocum of that village said that there was known to his grandfather a queer rumour concerning a charred, distorted body found in the fields a week after the death of Joseph Curwen was announced. What kept the talk alive was the notion that this body, so far as could be seen in its burnt and twisted condition, was neither thoroughly human nor wholly allied to any animal which Pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about.6.      Not one man who participated in that terrible raid could ever be induced to say a word concerning it, and every fragment of the vague data which survives comes from those outside the final fighting party. There is something frightful in the care with which these actual raiders destroyed each scrap which bore the least allusion to the matter. Eight sailors had been killed, but although their bodies were not produced their families were satisfied with the statement that a clash with customs officers had occurred. The same statement also covered the numerous cases of wounds, all of which were extensively bandaged and treated only by Dr. Jabez Bowen, who had accompanied the party. Hardest to explain was the nameless odour clinging to all the raiders, a thing which was discussed for weeks. Of the citizen leaders, Capt. Whipple and Moses Brown were most severely hurt, and letters of their wives testify the bewilderment which their reticence and close guarding of their bandages produced. Psychologically every participant was aged, sobered, and shaken. It is fortunate that they were all strong men of action and simple, orthodox religionists, for with more subtle introspectiveness and mental complexity they would have fared ill indeed. President Manning was the most disturbed; but even he outgrew the darkest shadow, and smothered memories in prayers. Every man of those leaders had a stirring part to play in later years, and it is perhaps fortunate that this is so. Little more than a twelvemonth afterward Capt. Whipple led the mob who burnt the revenue ship Gaspee, and in this bold act we may trace one step in the blotting out of unwholesome images.      There was delivered to the widow of Joseph Curwen a sealed leaden coffin of curious design, obviously found ready on the spot when needed, in which she was told her husbands body lay. He had, it was explained, been killed in a customs battle about which it was not politic to give details. More than this no tongue ever uttered of Joseph Curwens end, and Charles Ward had only a single hint wherewith to construct a theory. This hint was the merest thread - a shaky underscoring of a passage in Jedediah Ornes confiscated letter to Curwen, as partly copied in Ezra Weedens handwriting. The copy was found in the possession of Smiths descendants; and we are left to decide whether Weeden gave it to his companion after the end, as a mute clue to the abnormality which had occurred, or whether, as is more probable, Smith had it before, and added the underscoring himself from what he had managed to extract from his friend by shrewd guessing and adroit cross-questioning. The underlined passage is merely this:      \"I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe; by the Which I meane, Any that can in Turne call up somewhat against you, whereby your Powerfullest Devices may not be of use. Ask of the Lesser, lest the Greater shall not wish to Answer, and shall commande more than you.\"In the light of this passage, and reflecting on what last unmentionable allies a beaten man might try to summon in his direst extremity, Charles Ward may well have wondered whether any citizen of Providence killed Joseph Curwen.      The deliberate effacement of every memory of the dead man from Providence life and annals was vastly aided by the influence of the raiding leaders. They had not at first meant to be so thorough, and had allowed the widow and her father and child to remain in ignorance of the true conditions; but Capt. Tillinghast was an astute man, and soon uncovered enough rumours to whet his horror and cause him to demand that his daughter and granddaughter change their name, burn the library and all remaining papers, and chisel the inscription from the slate slab above Joseph Curwens grave. He knew Capt. Whipple well, and probably extracted more hints from that bluff mariner than anyone else ever gained respecting the end of the accused sorcerer.      From that time on the obliteration of Curwens memory became increasingly rigid, extending at last by common consent even to the town records and files of the Gazette. It can be compared in spirit only to the hush that lay on Oscar Wildes name for a decade after his disgrace, and in extent only to the fate of that sinful King of Runazar in Lord Dunsanys tale, whom the Gods decided must not only cease to be, but must cease ever to have been.      Mrs. Tillinghast, as the widow became known after 1772, sold the house in Olney Court and resided with her father in Powers Lane till her death in 1817. The farm at Pawtuxet, shunned by every living soul, remained to moulder through the years; and seemed to decay with unaccountable rapidity. By 1780 only the stone and brickwork were standing, and by 1800 even these had fallen to shapeless heaps. None ventured to pierce the tangled shrubbery on the river-bank behind which the hillside door may have lain, nor did any try to frame a definite image of the scenes amidst which Joseph Curwen departed from the horrors he had wrought.      Only robust old Capt. Whipple was heard by alert listeners to mutter once in a while to himself, \"Pox on that  -  -  - , but he had no business to laugh while he screamed. Twas as though the damnd  -  -  -  had someat up his sleeve. For half a crown Id burn his  -  -  -  house.\"", "VIII.In the meantime a quieter yet even more spiritually poignant phase of the horror had been blackly unwinding itself behind the closed door of a shelf-lined room in Arkham. The curious manuscript record or diary of Wilbur Whateley, delivered to Miskatonic University for translation, had caused much worry and bafflement among the experts in languages both ancient and modern; its very alphabet, notwithstanding a general resemblance to the heavily shaded Arabic used in Mesopotamia, being absolutely unknown to any available authority. The final conclusion of the linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet, giving the effect of a cipher; though none of the usual methods of cryptographic solution seemed to furnish any clue, even when applied on the basis of every tongue the writer might conceivably have used. The ancient books taken from Whateley’s quarters, while absorbingly interesting and in several cases promising to open up new and terrible lines of research among philosophers and men of science, were of no assistance whatever in this matter. One of them, a heavy tome with an iron clasp, was in another unknown alphabet—this one of a very different cast, and resembling Sanscrit more than anything else. The old ledger was at length given wholly into the charge of Dr. Armitage, both because of his peculiar interest in the Whateley matter, and because of his wide linguistic learning and skill in the mystical formulae of antiquity and the Middle Ages.      Armitage had an idea that the alphabet might be something esoterically used by certain forbidden cults which have come down from old times, and which have inherited many forms and traditions from the wizards of the Saracenic world. That question, however, he did not deem vital; since it would be unnecessary to know the origin of the symbols if, as he suspected, they were used as a cipher in a modern language. It was his belief that, considering the great amount of text involved, the writer would scarcely have wished the trouble of using another speech than his own, save perhaps in certain special formulae and incantations. Accordingly he attacked the manuscript with the preliminary assumption that the bulk of it was in English.      Dr. Armitage knew, from the repeated failures of his colleagues, that the riddle was a deep and complex one; and that no simple mode of solution could merit even a trial. All through late August he fortified himself with the massed lore of cryptography; drawing upon the fullest resources of his own library, and wading night after night amidst the arcana of Trithemius’ Poligraphia, Giambattista Porta’s De Furtivis Literarum Notis, De Vigenère’s Traité des Chiffres, Falconer’s Cryptomenysis Patefacta, Davys’ and Thicknesse’s eighteenth-century treatises, and such fairly modern authorities as Blair, von Marten, and Klüber’s Kryptographik. He interspersed his study of the books with attacks on the manuscript itself, and in time became convinced that he had to deal with one of those subtlest and most ingenious of cryptograms, in which many separate lists of corresponding letters are arranged like the multiplication table, and the message built up with arbitrary key-words known only to the initiated. The older authorities seemed rather more helpful than the newer ones, and Armitage concluded that the code of the manuscript was one of great antiquity, no doubt handed down through a long line of mystical experimenters. Several times he seemed near daylight, only to be set back by some unforeseen obstacle. Then, as September approached, the clouds began to clear. Certain letters, as used in certain parts of the manuscript, emerged definitely and unmistakably; and it became obvious that the text was indeed in English.      On the evening of September 2nd the last major barrier gave way, and Dr. Armitage read for the first time a continuous passage of Wilbur Whateley’s annals. It was in truth a diary, as all had thought; and it was couched in a style clearly shewing the mixed occult erudition and general illiteracy of the strange being who wrote it. Almost the first long passage that Armitage deciphered, an entry dated November 26, 1916, proved highly startling and disquieting. It was written, he remembered, by a child of three and a half who looked like a lad of twelve or thirteen.      “Today learned the Aklo for the Sabaoth,” it ran, “which did not like, it being answerable from the hill and not from the air. That upstairs more ahead of me than I had thought it would be, and is not like to have much earth brain. Shot Elam Hutchins’ collie Jack when he went to bite me, and Elam says he would kill me if he dast. I guess he won’t. Grandfather kept me saying the Dho formula last night, and I think I saw the inner city at the 2 magnetic poles. I shall go to those poles when the earth is cleared off, if I can’t break through with the Dho-Hna formula when I commit it. They from the air told me at Sabbat that it will be years before I can clear off the earth, and I guess grandfather will be dead then, so I shall have to learn all the angles of the planes and all the formulas between the Yr and the Nhhngr. They from outside will help, but they cannot take body without human blood. That upstairs looks it will have the right cast. I can see it a little when I make the Voorish sign or blow the powder of Ibn Ghazi at it, and it is near like them at May-Eve on the Hill. The other face may wear off some. I wonder how I shall look when the earth is cleared and there are no earth beings on it. He that came with the Aklo Sabaoth said I may be transfigured, there being much of outside to work on.”      Morning found Dr. Armitage in a cold sweat of terror and a frenzy of wakeful concentration. He had not left the manuscript all night, but sat at his table under the electric light turning page after page with shaking hands as fast as he could decipher the cryptic text. He had nervously telephoned his wife he would not be home, and when she brought him a breakfast from the house he could scarcely dispose of a mouthful. All that day he read on, now and then halted maddeningly as a reapplication of the complex key became necessary. Lunch and dinner were brought him, but he ate only the smallest fraction of either. Toward the middle of the next night he drowsed off in his chair, but soon woke out of a tangle of nightmares almost as hideous as the truths and menaces to man’s existence that he had uncovered.      On the morning of September 4th Professor Rice and Dr. Morgan insisted on seeing him for a while, and departed trembling and ashen-grey. That evening he went to bed, but slept only fitfully. Wednesday—the next day—he was back at the manuscript, and began to take copious notes both from the current sections and from those he had already deciphered. In the small hours of that night he slept a little in an easy-chair in his office, but was at the manuscript again before dawn. Some time before noon his physician, Dr. Hartwell, called to see him and insisted that he cease work. He refused; intimating that it was of the most vital importance for him to complete the reading of the diary, and promising an explanation in due course of time.      That evening, just as twilight fell, he finished his terrible perusal and sank back exhausted. His wife, bringing his dinner, found him in a half-comatose state; but he was conscious enough to warn her off with a sharp cry when he saw her eyes wander toward the notes he had taken. Weakly rising, he gathered up the scribbled papers and sealed them all in a great envelope, which he immediately placed in his inside coat pocket. He had sufficient strength to get home, but was so clearly in need of medical aid that Dr. Hartwell was summoned at once. As the doctor put him to bed he could only mutter over and over again, “But what, in God’s name, can we do?”      Dr. Armitage slept, but was partly delirious the next day. He made no explanations to Hartwell, but in his calmer moments spoke of the imperative need of a long conference with Rice and Morgan. His wilder wanderings were very startling indeed, including frantic appeals that something in a boarded-up farmhouse be destroyed, and fantastic references to some plan for the extirpation of the entire human race and all animal and vegetable life from the earth by some terrible elder race of beings from another dimension. He would shout that the world was in danger, since the Elder Things wished to strip it and drag it away from the solar system and cosmos of matter into some other plane or phase of entity from which it had once fallen, vigintillions of aeons ago. At other times he would call for the dreaded Necronomicon and the Daemonolatreia of Remigius, in which he seemed hopeful of finding some formula to check the peril he conjured up.      “Stop them, stop them!” he would shout. “Those Whateleys meant to let them in, and the worst of all is left! Tell Rice and Morgan we must do something—it’s a blind business, but I know how to make the powder. . . . It hasn’t been fed since the second of August, when Wilbur came here to his death, and at that rate. . . .”      But Armitage had a sound physique despite his seventy-three years, and slept off his disorder that night without developing any real fever. He woke late Friday, clear of head, though sober with a gnawing fear and tremendous sense of responsibility. Saturday afternoon he felt able to go over to the library and summon Rice and Morgan for a conference, and the rest of that day and evening the three men tortured their brains in the wildest speculation and the most desperate debate. Strange and terrible books were drawn voluminously from the stack shelves and from secure places of storage; and diagrams and formulae were copied with feverish haste and in bewildering abundance. Of scepticism there was none. All three had seen the body of Wilbur Whateley as it lay on the floor in a room of that very building, and after that not one of them could feel even slightly inclined to treat the diary as a madman’s raving.      Opinions were divided as to notifying the Massachusetts State Police, and the negative finally won. There were things involved which simply could not be believed by those who had not seen a sample, as indeed was made clear during certain subsequent investigations. Late at night the conference disbanded without having developed a definite plan, but all day Sunday Armitage was busy comparing formulae and mixing chemicals obtained from the college laboratory. The more he reflected on the hellish diary, the more he was inclined to doubt the efficacy of any material agent in stamping out the entity which Wilbur Whateley had left behind him—the earth-threatening entity which, unknown to him, was to burst forth in a few hours and become the memorable Dunwich horror.      Monday was a repetition of Sunday with Dr. Armitage, for the task in hand required an infinity of research and experiment. Further consultations of the monstrous diary brought about various changes of plan, and he knew that even in the end a large amount of uncertainty must remain. By Tuesday he had a definite line of action mapped out, and believed he would try a trip to Dunwich within a week. Then, on Wednesday, the great shock came. Tucked obscurely away in a corner of the Arkham Advertiser was a facetious little item from the Associated Press, telling what a record-breaking monster the bootleg whiskey of Dunwich had raised up. Armitage, half stunned, could only telephone for Rice and Morgan. Far into the night they discussed, and the next day was a whirlwind of preparation on the part of them all. Armitage knew he would be meddling with terrible powers, yet saw that there was no other way to annul the deeper and more malign meddling which others had done before him."]}
{"id": "EN085", "pair": ["II. An Antecedent and a Horror1.Joseph Curwen, as revealed by the rambling legends embodied in what Ward heard and unearthed, was a very astonishing, enigmatic, and obscurely horrible individual. He had fled from Salem to Providence - that universal haven of the odd, the free, and the dissenting - at the beginning of the great witchcraft panic; being in fear of accusation because of his solitary ways and queer chemical or alchemical experiments. He was a colourless-looking man of about thirty, and was soon found qualified to become a freeman of Providence; thereafter buying a home lot just north of Gregory Dexters at about the foot of Olney Street. His house was built on Stampers Hill west of the Town Street, in what later became Olney Court; and in 1761 he replaced this with a larger one, on the same site, which is still standing.      Now the first odd thing about Joseph Curwen was that he did not seem to grow much older than he had been on his arrival. He engaged in shipping enterprises, purchased wharfage near Mile-End Cove, helped rebuild the Great Bridge in 1713, and in 1723 was one of the founders of the Congregational Church on the hill; but always did he retain the nondescript aspect of a man not greatly over thirty or thirty-five. As decades mounted up, this singular quality began to excite wide notice; but Curwen always explained it by saying that he came of hardy forefathers, and practiced a simplicity of living which did not wear him out. How such simplicity could be reconciled with the inexplicable comings and goings of the secretive merchant, and with the queer gleaming of his windows at all hours of night, was not very clear to the townsfolk; and they were prone to assign other reasons for his continued youth and longevity. It was held, for the most part, that Curwens incessant mixings and boilings of chemicals had much to do with his condition. Gossip spoke of the strange substances he brought from London and the Indies on his ships or purchased in Newport, Boston, and New York; and when old Dr. Jabez Bowen came from Rehoboth and opened his apothecary shop across the Great Bridge at the Sign of the Unicorn and Mortar, there was ceaseless talk of the drugs, acids, and metals that the taciturn recluse incessantly bought or ordered from him. Acting on the assumption that Curwen possessed a wondrous and secret medical skill, many sufferers of various sorts applied to him for aid; but though he appeared to encourage their belief in a non-committal way, and always gave them odd-coloured potions in response to their requests, it was observed that his ministrations to others seldom proved of benefit. At length, when over fifty years had passed since the strangers advent, and without producing more than five years apparent change in his face and physique, the people began to whisper more darkly; and to meet more than half way that desire for isolation which he had always shewn.      Private letters and diaries of the period reveal, too, a multitude of other reasons why Joseph Curwen was marvelled at, feared, and finally shunned like a plague. His passion for graveyards, in which he was glimpsed at all hours and under all conditions, was notorious; though no one had witnessed any deed on his part which could actually be termed ghoulish. On the Pawtuxet Road he had a farm, at which he generally lived during the summer, and to which he would frequently be seen riding at various odd times of the day or night. Here his only visible servants, farmers, and caretakers were a sullen pair of aged Narragansett Indians; the husband dumb and curiously scarred, and the wife of a very repulsive cast of countenance, probably due to a mixture of negro blood. In the lean-to of this house was the laboratory where most of the chemical experiments were conducted. Curious porters and teamers who delivered bottles, bags, or boxes at the small rear door would exchange accounts of the fantastic flasks, crucibles, alembics, and furnaces they saw in the low shelved room; and prophesied in whispers that the close-mouthed \"chymist\" - by which they meant alchemist - would not be long in finding the Philosophers Stone. The nearest neighbours to this farm - the Fenners, a quarter of a mile away - had still queerer things to tell of certain sounds which they insisted came from the Curwen place in the night. There were cries, they said, and sustained howlings; and they did not like the large number of livestock which thronged the pastures, for no such amount was needed to keep a lone old man and a very few servants in meat, milk, and wool. The identity of the stock seemed to change from week to week as new droves were purchased from the Kingstown farmers. Then, too, there was something very obnoxious about a certain great stone outbuilding with only high narrow slits for windows.      Great Bridge idlers likewise had much to say of Curwens town house in Olney Court; not so much the fine new one built in 1761, when the man must have been nearly a century old, but the first low gambrel-roofed one with the windowless attic and shingled sides, whose timbers he took the peculiar precaution of burning after its demolition. Here there was less mystery, it is true; but the hours at which lights were seen, the secretiveness of the two swarthy foreigners who comprised the only menservants, the hideous indistinct mumbling of the incredibly aged French housekeeper, the large amounts of food seen to enter a door within which only four persons lived, and the quality of certain voices often heard in muffled conversation at highly unseasonable times, all combined with what was known of the Pawtuxet farm to give the place a bad name.      In choicer circles, too, the Curwen home was by no means undiscussed; for as the newcomer had gradually worked into the church and trading life of the town, he had naturally made acquaintances of the better sort, whose company and conversation he was well fitted by education to enjoy. His birth was known to be good, since the Curwens or Corwins of Salem needed no introduction in New England. It developed that Joseph Curwen had travelled much in very early life, living for a time in England and making at least two voyages to the Orient; and his speech, when he deigned to use it, was that of a learned and cultivated Englishman. But for some reason or other Curwen did not care for society. Whilst never actually rebuffing a visitor, he always reared such a wall of reserve that few could think of anything to say to him which would not sound inane.      There seemed to lurk in his bearing some cryptic, sardonic arrogance, as if he had come to find all human beings dull through having moved among stranger and more potent entities. When Dr. Checkley the famous wit came from Boston in 1738 to be rector of Kings Church, he did not neglect calling on one of whom he soon heard so much; but left in a very short while because of some sinister undercurrent he detected in his hosts discourse. Charles Ward told his father, when they discussed Curwen one winter evening, that he would give much to learn what the mysterious old man had said to the sprightly cleric, but that all diarists agree concerning Dr. Checkleys reluctance to repeat anything he had heard. The good man had been hideously shocked, and could never recall Joseph Curwen without a visible loss of the gay urbanity for which he was famed.      More definite, however, was the reason why another man of taste and breeding avoided the haughty hermit. In 1746 Mr. John Merritt, an elderly English gentleman of literary and scientific leanings, came from Newport to the town which was so rapidly overtaking it in standing, and built a fine country seat on the Neck in what is now the heart of the best residence section. He lived in considerable style and comfort, keeping the first coach and liveried servants in town, and taking great pride in his telescope, his microscope, and his well-chosen library of English and Latin books. Hearing of Curwen as the owner of the best library in Providence, Mr. Merritt early paid him a call, and was more cordially received than most other callers at the house had been. His admiration for his hosts ample shelves, which besides the Greek, Latin, and English classics were equipped with a remarkable battery of philosophical, mathematical, and scientific works including Paracelsus, Agricola, Van Helmont, Sylvius, Glauber, Boyle, Boerhaave, Becher, and Stahl, led Curwen to suggest a visit to the farmhouse and laboratory whither he had never invited anyone before; and the two drove out at once in Mr. Merritts coach.      Mr. Merritt always confessed to seeing nothing really horrible at the farmhouse, but maintained that the titles of the books in the special library of thaumaturgical, alchemical, and theological subjects which Curwen kept in a front room were alone sufficient to inspire him with a lasting loathing. Perhaps, however, the facial expression of the owner in exhibiting them contributed much of the prejudice. The bizarre collection, besides a host of standard works which Mr. Merritt was not too alarmed to envy, embraced nearly all the cabbalists, daemonologists, and magicians known to man; and was a treasure-house of lore in the doubtful realms of alchemy and astrology. Hermes Trismegistus in Mesnards edition, the Turba Philosophorum, Gebers Liber Investigationis, and Artephius Key of Wisdom all were there; with the cabbalistic Zohar, Peter Jammys set of Albertus Magnus, Raymond Lullys Ars Magna et Ultima in Zetzners edition, Roger Bacons Thesaurus Chemicus, Fludds Clavis Alchimiae, and Trithemius De Lapide Philosophico crowding them close. Mediaeval Jews and Arabs were represented in profusion, and Mr. Merritt turned pale when, upon taking down a fine volume conspicuously labelled as the Qanoon-e-Islam, he found it was in truth the forbidden Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred, of which he had heard such monstrous things whispered some years previously after the exposure of nameless rites at the strange little fishing village of Kingsport, in the Province of the Massachusetts-Bay.      But oddly enough, the worthy gentleman owned himself most impalpably disquieted by a mere minor detail. On the huge mahogany table there lay face downward a badly worn copy of Borellus, bearing many cryptical marginalia and interlineations in Curwens hand. The book was open at about its middle, and one paragraph displayed such thick and tremulous pen-strokes beneath the lines of mystic black-letter that the visitor could not resist scanning it through. Whether it was the nature of the passage underscored, or the feverish heaviness of the strokes which formed the underscoring, he could not tell; but something in that combination affected him very badly and very peculiarly. He recalled it to the end of his days, writing it down from memory in his diary and once trying to recite it to his close friend Dr. Checkley till he saw how greatly it disturbed the urbane rector. It read:      \"The essential Saltes of Animals may be so prepared and preserved, that an ingenious Man may have the whole Ark of Noah in his own Studie, and raise the fine Shape of an Animal out of its Ashes at his Pleasure; and by the lyke Method from the essential Saltes of humane Dust, a Philosopher may, without any criminal Necromancy, call up the Shape of any dead Ancestour from the Dust whereinto his Bodie has been incinerated.\"      It was near the docks along the southerly part of the Town Street, however, that the worst things were muttered about Joseph Curwen. Sailors are superstitious folk; and the seasoned salts who manned the infinite rum, slave, and molasses sloops, the rakish privateers, and the great brigs of the Browns, Crawfords, and Tillinghasts, all made strange furtive signs of protection when they saw the slim, deceptively young-looking figure with its yellow hair and slight stoop entering the Curwen warehouse in Doubloon Street or talking with captains and supercargoes on the long quay where the Curwen ships rode restlessly. Curwens own clerks and captains hated and feared him, and all his sailors were mongrel riff-raff from Martinique, St. Eustatius, Havana, or Port Royal. It was, in a way, the frequency with which these sailors were replaced which inspired the acutest and most tangible part of the fear in which the old man was held. A crew would be turned loose in the town on shore leave, some of its members perhaps charged with this errand or that; and when reassembled it would be almost sure to lack one or more men. That many of the errands had concerned the farm on the Pawtuxet Road, and that few of the sailors had ever been seen to return from that place, was not forgotten; so that in time it became exceedingly difficult for Curwen to keep his oddly assorted hands. Almost invariably several would desert soon after hearing the gossip of the Providence wharves, and their replacement in the West Indies became an increasingly great problem to the merchant.      In 1760 Joseph Curwen was virtually an outcast, suspected of vague horrors and daemoniac alliances which seemed all the more menacing because they could not be named, understood, or even proved to exist. The last straw may have come from the affair of the missing soldiers in 1758, for in March and April of that year two Royal regiments on their way to New France were quartered in Providence, and depleted by an inexplicable process far beyond the average rate of desertion. Rumour dwelt on the frequency with which Curwen was wont to be seen talking with the red-coated strangers; and as several of them began to be missed, people thought of the odd conditions among his own seamen. What would have happened if the regiments had not been ordered on, no one can tell.      Meanwhile the merchants worldly affairs were prospering. He had a virtual monopoly of the towns trade in saltpetre, black pepper, and cinnamon, and easily led any other one shipping establishment save the Browns in his importation of brassware, indigo, cotton, woollens, salt, rigging, iron, paper, and English goods of every kind. Such shopkeepers as James Green, at the Sign of the Elephant in Cheapside, the Russells, at the Sign of the Golden Eagle across the Bridge, or Clark and Nightingale at the Frying-Pan and Fish near the New Coffee-House, depended almost wholly upon him for their stock; and his arrangements with the local distillers, the Narragansett dairymen and horse-breeders, and the Newport candle-makers, made him one of the prime exporters of the Colony.      Ostracised though he was, he did not lack for civic spirit of a sort. When the Colony House burned down, he subscribed handsomely to the lotteries by which the new brick one - still standing at the head of its parade in the old main street - was built in 1761. In that same year, too, he helped rebuild the Great Bridge after the October gale. He replaced many of the books of the public library consumed in the Colony House fire, and bought heavily in the lottery that gave the muddy Market Parade and deep-rutted Town Street their pavement of great round stones with a brick footwalk or \"causey\" in the middle. About this time, also, he built the plain but excellent new house whose doorway is still such a triumph of carving. When the Whitefield adherents broke off from Dr. Cottons hill church in 1743 and founded Deacon Snows church across the Bridge, Curwen had gone with them; though his zeal and attendance soon abated. Now, however, he cultivated piety once more; as if to dispel the shadow which had thrown him into isolation and would soon begin to wreck his business fortunes if not sharply checked.2.      The sight of this strange, pallid man, hardly middle-aged in aspect yet certainly not less than a full century old, seeking at last to emerge from a cloud of fright and detestation too vague to pin down or analyse, was at once a pathetic, a dramatic, and a contemptible thing. Such is the power of wealth and of surface gestures, however, that there came indeed a slight abatement in the visible aversion displayed toward him; especially after the rapid disappearances of his sailors abruptly ceased. He must likewise have begun to practice an extreme care and secrecy in his graveyard expeditions, for he was never again caught at such wanderings; whilst the rumours of uncanny sounds and manoeuvres at his Pawtuxet farm diminished in proportion. His rate of food consumption and cattle replacement remained abnormally high; but not until modern times, when Charles Ward examined a set of his accounts and invoices in the Shepley Library, did it occur to any person - save one embittered youth, perhaps - to make dark comparisons between the large number of Guinea blacks he imported until 1766, and the disturbingly small number for whom he could produce bona fide bills of sale either to slave-dealers at the Great Bridge or to the planters of the Narragansett Country. Certainly, the cunning and ingenuity of this abhorred character were uncannily profound, once the necessity for their exercise had become impressed upon him.      But of course the effect of all this belated mending was necessarily slight. Curwen continued to be avoided and distrusted, as indeed the one fact of his continued air of youth at a great age would have been enough to warrant; and he could see that in the end his fortunes would be likely to suffer. His elaborate studies and experiments, whatever they may have been, apparently required a heavy income for their maintenance; and since a change of environment would deprive him of the trading advantages he had gained, it would not have profited him to begin anew in a different region just then. Judgment demanded that he patch up his relations with the townsfolk of Providence, so that his presence might no longer be a signal for hushed conversation, transparent excuses of errands elsewhere, and a general atmosphere of constraint and uneasiness. His clerks, being now reduced to the shiftless and impecunious residue whom no one else would employ, were giving him much worry; and he held to his sea-captains and mates only by shrewdness in gaining some kind of ascendancy over them - a mortgage, a promissory note, or a bit of information very pertinent to their welfare. In many cases, diarists have recorded with some awe, Curwen shewed almost the power of a wizard in unearthing family secrets for questionable use. During the final five years of his life it seemed as though only direct talks with the long-dead could possibly have furnished some of the data which he had so glibly at his tongues end.      About this time the crafty scholar hit upon a last desperate expedient to regain his footing in the community. Hitherto a complete hermit, he now determined to contract an advantageous marriage; securing as a bride some lady whose unquestioned position would make all ostracism of his home impossible. It may be that he also had deeper reasons for wishing an alliance; reasons so far outside the known cosmic sphere that only papers found a century and a half after his death caused anyone to suspect them; but of this nothing certain can ever be learned. Naturally he was aware of the horror and indignation with which any ordinary courtship of his would be received, hence he looked about for some likely candidate upon whose parents he might exert a suitable pressure. Such candidates, he found, were not at all easy to discover; since he had very particular requirements in the way of beauty, accomplishments, and social security. At length his survey narrowed down to the household of one of his best and oldest ship-captains, a widower of high birth and unblemished standing named Dutee Tillinghast, whose only daughter Eliza seemed dowered with every conceivable advantage save prospects as an heiress. Capt. Tillinghast was completely under the domination of Curwen; and consented, after a terrible interview in his cupolaed house on Powers Lane hill, to sanction the blasphemous alliance.      Eliza Tillinghast was at that time eighteen years of age, and had been reared as gently as the reduced circumstances of her father permitted. She had attended Stephen Jacksons school opposite the Court-House Parade; and had been diligently instructed by her mother, before the latters death of smallpox in 1757, in all the arts and refinements of domestic life. A sampler of hers, worked in 1753 at the age of nine, may still be found in the rooms of the Rhode Island Historical Society. After her mothers death she had kept the house, aided only by one old black woman. Her arguments with her father concerning the proposed Curwen marriage must have been painful indeed; but of these we have no record. Certain it is that her engagement to young Ezra Weeden, second mate of the Crawford packet Enterprise, was dutifully broken off, and that her union with Joseph Curwen took place on the seventh of March, 1763, in the Baptist church, in the presence of one of the most distinguished assemblages which the town could boast; the ceremony being performed by the younger Samuel Winsor. The Gazette mentioned the event very briefly, and in most surviving copies the item in question seems to be cut or torn out. Ward found a single intact copy after much search in the archives of a private collector of note, observing with amusement the meaningless urbanity of the language:      \"Monday evening last, Mr. Joseph Curwen, of this Town, Merchant, was married to Miss Eliza Tillinghast, Daughter of Capt. Dutee Tillinghast, a young Lady who has real Merit, added to a beautiful Person, to grace the connubial State and perpetuate its Felicity.\"      The collection of Durfee-Arnold letters, discovered by Charles Ward shortly before his first reputed madness in the private collection of Melville F. Peters, Esq., of George St., and covering this and a somewhat antecedent period, throws vivid light on the outrage done to public sentiment by this ill-assorted match. The social influence of the Tillinghasts, however, was not to be denied; and once more Joseph Curwen found his house frequented by persons whom he could never otherwise have induced to cross his threshold. His acceptance was by no means complete, and his bride was socially the sufferer through her forced venture; but at all events the wall of utter ostracism was somewhat worn down. In his treatment of his wife the strange bridegroom astonished both her and the community by displaying an extreme graciousness and consideration. The new house in Olney Court was now wholly free from disturbing manifestations, and although Curwen was much absent at the Pawtuxet farm which his wife never visited, he seemed more like a normal citizen than at any other time in his long years of residence. Only one person remained in open enmity with him, this being the youthful ships officer whose engagement to Eliza Tillinghast had been so abruptly broken. Ezra Weeden had frankly vowed vengeance; and though of a quiet and ordinarily mild disposition, was now gaining a hate-bred, dogged purpose which boded no good to the usurping husband.      On the seventh of May, 1765, Curwens only child Ann was born; and was christened by the Rev. John Graves of Kings Church, of which both husband and wife had become communicants shortly after their marriage, in order to compromise between their respective Congregational and Baptist affiliations. The record of this birth, as well as that of the marriage two years before, was stricken from most copies of the church and town annals where it ought to appear; and Charles Ward located both with the greatest difficulty after his discovery of the widows change of name had apprised him of his own relationship, and engendered the feverish interest which culminated in his madness. The birth entry, indeed, was found very curiously through correspondence with the heirs of the loyalist Dr. Graves, who had taken with him a duplicate set of records when he left his pastorate at the outbreak of the Revolution. Ward had tried this source because he knew that his great-great-grandmother Ann Tillinghast Potter had been an Episcopalian.      Shortly after the birth of his daughter, an event he seemed to welcome with a fervour greatly out of keeping with his usual coldness, Curwen resolved to sit for a portrait. This he had painted by a very gifted Scotsman named Cosmo Alexander, then a resident of Newport, and since famous as the early teacher of Gilbert Stuart. The likeness was said to have been executed on a wall-panel of the library of the house in Olney Court, but neither of the two old diaries mentioning it gave any hint of its ultimate disposition. At this period the erratic scholar shewed signs of unusual abstraction, and spent as much time as he possibly could at his farm on the Pawtuxet Road. He seemed, it was stated, in a condition of suppressed excitement or suspense; as if expecting some phenomenal thing or on the brink of some strange discovery. Chemistry or alchemy would appear to have played a great part, for he took from his house to the farm the greater number of his volumes on that subject.      His affectation of civic interest did not diminish, and he lost no opportunities for helping such leaders as Stephen Hopkins, Joseph Brown, and Benjamin West in their efforts to raise the cultural tone of the town, which was then much below the level of Newport in its patronage of the liberal arts. He had helped Daniel Jenckes found his bookshop in 1763, and was thereafter his best customer; extending aid likewise to the struggling Gazette that appeared each Wednesday at the Sign of Shakespears Head. In politics he ardently supported Governor Hopkins against the Ward party whose prime strength was in Newport, and his really eloquent speech at Hackers Hall in 1765 against the setting off of North Providence as a separate town with a pro-Ward vote in the General Assembly did more than any other one thing to wear down the prejudice against him. But Ezra Weeden, who watched him closely, sneered cynically at all this outward activity; and freely swore it was no more than a mask for some nameless traffick with the blackest gulfs of Tartarus. The revengeful youth began a systematic study of the man and his doings whenever he was in port; spending hours at night by the wharves with a dory in readiness when he saw lights in the Curwen warehouses, and following the small boat which would sometimes steal quietly off and down the bay. He also kept as close a watch as possible on the Pawtuxet farm, and was once severely bitten by the dogs the old Indian couple loosed upon him.3.      In 1766 came the final change in Joseph Curwen. It was very sudden, and gained wide notice amongst the curious townsfolk; for the air of suspense and expectancy dropped like an old cloak, giving instant place to an ill-concealed exaltation of perfect triumph. Curwen seemed to have difficulty in restraining himself from public harangues on what he had found or learned or made; but apparently the need of secrecy was greater than the longing to share his rejoicing, for no explanation was ever offered by him. It was after this transition, which appears to have come early in July, that the sinister scholar began to astonish people by his possession of information which only their long-dead ancestors would seem to be able to impart.      But Curwens feverish secret activities by no means ceased with this change. On the contrary, they tended rather to increase; so that more and more of his shipping business was handled by the captains whom he now bound to him by ties of fear as potent as those of bankruptcy had been. He altogether abandoned the slave trade, alleging that its profits were constantly decreasing. Every possible moment was spent at the Pawtuxet farm; though there were rumours now and then of his presence in places which, though not actually near graveyards, were yet so situated in relation to graveyards that thoughtful people wondered just how thorough the old merchants change of habits really was. Ezra Weeden, though his periods of espionage were necessarily brief and intermittent on account of his sea voyaging, had a vindictive persistence which the bulk of the practical townsfolk and farmers lacked; and subjected Curwens affairs to a scrutiny such as they had never had before.      Many of the odd manoeuvres of the strange merchants vessels had been taken for granted on account of the unrest of the times, when every colonist seemed determined to resist the provisions of the Sugar Act which hampered a prominent traffick. Smuggling and evasion were the rule in Narragansett Bay, and nocturnal landings of illicit cargoes were continuous commonplaces. But Weeden, night after night following the lighters or small sloops which he saw steal off from the Curwen warehouses at the Town Street docks, soon felt assured that it was not merely His Majestys armed ships which the sinister skulker was anxious to avoid. Prior to the change in 1766 these boats had for the most part contained chained negroes, who were carried down and across the bay and landed at an obscure point on the shore just north of Pawtuxet; being afterward driven up the bluff and across country to the Curwen farm, where they were locked in that enormous stone outbuilding which had only high narrow slits for windows. After that change, however, the whole programme was altered. Importation of slaves ceased at once, and for a time Curwen abandoned his midnight sailings. Then, about the spring of 1767, a new policy appeared. Once more the lighters grew wont to put out from the black, silent docks, and this time they would go down the bay some distance, perhaps as far as Namquit Point, where they would meet and receive cargo from strange ships of considerable size and widely varied appearance. Curwens sailors would then deposit this cargo at the usual point on the shore, and transport it overland to the farm; locking it in the same cryptical stone building which had formerly received the negroes. The cargo consisted almost wholly of boxes and cases, of which a large proportion were oblong and heavy and disturbingly suggestive of coffins.      Weeden always watched the farm with unremitting assiduity; visiting it each night for long periods, and seldom letting a week go by without a sight except when the ground bore a footprint-revealing snow. Even then he would often walk as close as possible in the travelled road or on the ice of the neighbouring river to see what tracks others might have left. Finding his own vigils interrupted by nautical duties, he hired a tavern companion named Eleazar Smith to continue the survey during his absences; and between them the two could have set in motion some extraordinary rumours. That they did not do so was only because they knew the effect of publicity would be to warn their quarry and make further progress impossible. Instead, they wished to learn something definite before taking any action. What they did learn must have been startling indeed, and Charles Ward spoke many times to his parents of his regret at Weedens later burning of his notebooks. All that can be told of their discoveries is what Eleazar Smith jotted down in a none too coherent diary, and what other diarists and letter-writers have timidly repeated from the statements which they finally made - and according to which the farm was only the outer shell of some vast and revolting menace, of a scope and depth too profound and intangible for more than shadowy comprehension.      It is gathered that Weeden and Smith became early convinced that a great series of tunnels and catacombs, inhabited by a very sizeable staff of persons besides the old Indian and his wife, underlay the farm. The house was an old peaked relic of the middle seventeenth century with enormous stack chimney and diamond-paned lattice windows, the laboratory being in a lean-to toward the north, where the roof came nearly to the ground. This building stood clear of any other; yet judging by the different voices heard at odd times within, it must have been accessible through secret passages beneath. These voices, before 1766, were mere mumblings and negro whisperings and frenzied screams, coupled with curious chants or invocations. After that date, however, they assumed a very singular and terrible cast as they ran the gamut betwixt dronings of dull acquiescence and explosions of frantic pain or fury, rumblings of conversation and whines of entreaty, pantings of eagerness and shouts of protest. They appeared to be in different languages, all known to Curwen, whose rasping accents were frequently distinguishable in reply, reproof, or threatening. Sometimes it seemed that several persons must be in the house; Curwen, certain captives, and the guards of those captives. There were voices of a sort that neither Weeden nor Smith had ever heard before despite their wide knowledge of foreign parts, and many that they did seem to place as belonging to this or that nationality. The nature of the conversations seemed always a kind of catechism, as if Curwen were extorting some sort of information from terrified or rebellious prisoners.      Weeden had many verbatim reports of overheard scraps in his notebook, for English, French, and Spanish, which he knew, were frequently used; but of these nothing has survived. He did, however, say that besides a few ghoulish dialogues in which the past affairs of Providence families were concerned, most of the questions and answers he could understand were historical or scientific; occasionally pertaining to very remote places and ages. Once, for example, an alternately raging and sullen figure was questioned in French about the Black Princes massacre at Limoges in 1370, as if there were some hidden reason which he ought to know. Curwen asked the prisoner - if prisoner it were - whether the order to slay was given because of the Sign of the Goat found on the altar in the ancient Roman crypt beneath the Cathedral, or whether the Dark Man of the Haute Vienne Coven had spoken the Three Words. Failing to obtain replies, the inquisitor had seemingly resorted to extreme means; for there was a terrific shriek followed by silence and muttering and a bumping sound.      None of these colloquies were ever ocularly witnessed, since the windows were always heavily draped. Once, though, during a discourse in an unknown tongue, a shadow was seen on the curtain which startled Weeden exceedingly; reminding him of one of the puppets in a show he had seen in the autumn of 1764 in Hackers Hall, when a man from Germantown, Pennsylvania, had given a clever mechanical spectacle advertised as a \"View of the Famous City of Jerusalem, in which are represented Jerusalem, the Temple of Solomon, his Royal Throne, the noted Towers, and Hills, likewise the Sufferings of Our Saviour from the Garden of Gethsemane to the Cross on the Hill of Golgotha; an artful piece of Statuary, Worthy to be seen by the Curious.\" It was on this occasion that the listener, who had crept close to the window of the front room whence the speaking proceeded, gave a start which roused the old Indian pair and caused them to loose the dogs on him. After that no more conversations were ever heard in the house, and Weeden and Smith concluded that Curwen had transferred his field of action to regions below.      That such regions in truth existed, seemed amply clear from many things. Faint cries and groans unmistakably came up now and then from what appeared to be the solid earth in places far from any structure; whilst hidden in the bushes along the river-bank in the rear, where the high ground sloped steeply down to the valley of the Pawtuxet, there was found an arched oaken door in a frame of heavy masonry, which was obviously an entrance to caverns within the hill. When or how these catacombs could have been constructed, Weeden was unable to say; but he frequently pointed out how easily the place might have been reached by bands of unseen workmen from the river. Joseph Curwen put his mongrel seamen to diverse uses indeed! During the heavy spring rains of 1769 the two watchers kept a sharp eye on the steep river-bank to see if any subterrene secrets might be washed to light, and were rewarded by the sight of a profusion of both human and animal bones in places where deep gullies had been worn in the banks. Naturally there might be many explanations of such things in the rear of a stock farm, and in a locality where old Indian burying-grounds were common, but Weeden and Smith drew their own inferences.      It was in January 1770, whilst Weeden and Smith were still debating vainly on what, if anything, to think or do about the whole bewildering business, that the incident of the Fortaleza occurred. Exasperated by the burning of the revenue sloop Liberty at Newport during the previous summer, the customs fleet under Admiral Wallace had adopted an increased vigilance concerning strange vessels; and on this occasion His Majestys armed schooner Cygnet, under Capt. Charles Leslie, captured after a short pursuit one early morning the snow Fortaleza of Barcelona, Spain, under Capt. Manuel Arruda, bound according to its log from Grand Cairo, Egypt, to Providence. When searched for contraband material, this ship revealed the astonishing fact that its cargo consisted exclusively of Egyptian mummies, consigned to \"Sailor A. B. C.\", who would come to remove his goods in a lighter just off Namquit Point and whose identity Capt. Arruda felt himself in honour bound not to reveal. The Vice-Admiralty Court at Newport, at a loss what to do in view of the non-contraband nature of the cargo on the one hand and of the unlawful secrecy of the entry on the other hand, compromised on Collector Robinsons recommendation by freeing the ship but forbidding it a port in Rhode Island waters. There were later rumours of its having been seen in Boston Harbour, though it never openly entered the Port of Boston.      This extraordinary incident did not fail of wide remark in Providence, and there were not many who doubted the existence of some connexion between the cargo of mummies and the sinister Joseph Curwen. His exotic studies and his curious chemical importations being common knowledge, and his fondness for graveyards being common suspicion; it did not take much imagination to link him with a freakish importation which could not conceivably have been destined for anyone else in the town. As if conscious of this natural belief, Curwen took care to speak casually on several occasions of the chemical value of the balsams found in mummies; thinking perhaps that he might make the affair seem less unnatural, yet stopping just short of admitting his participation. Weeden and Smith, of course, felt no doubt whatsoever of the significance of the thing; and indulged in the wildest theories concerning Curwen and his monstrous labours.      The following spring, like that of the year before, had heavy rains; and the watchers kept careful track of the river-bank behind the Curwen farm. Large sections were washed away, and a certain number of bones discovered; but no glimpse was afforded of any actual subterranean chambers or burrows. Something was rumoured, however, at the village of Pawtuxet about a mile below, where the river flows in falls over a rocky terrace to join the placid landlocked cove. There, where quaint old cottages climbed the hill from the rustic bridge, and fishing-smacks lay anchored at their sleepy docks, a vague report went round of things that were floating down the river and flashing into sight for a minute as they went over the falls. Of course the Pawtuxet is a long river which winds through many settled regions abounding in graveyards, and of course the spring rains had been very heavy; but the fisherfolk about the bridge did not like the wild way that one of the things stared as it shot down to the still water below, or the way that another half cried out although its condition had greatly departed from that of objects which normally cry out. That rumour sent Smith - for Weeden was just then at sea - in haste to the river-bank behind the farm; where surely enough there remained the evidences of an extensive cave-in. There was, however, no trace of a passage into the steep bank; for the miniature avalanche had left behind a solid wall of mixed earth and shrubbery from aloft. Smith went to the extent of some experimental digging, but was deterred by lack of success - or perhaps by fear of possible success. It is interesting to speculate on what the persistent and revengeful Weeden would have done had he been ashore at the time.4.      By the autumn of 1770 Weeden decided that the time was ripe to tell others of his discoveries; for he had a large number of facts to link together, and a second eye-witness to refute the possible charge that jealousy and vindictiveness had spurred his fancy. As his first confidant he selected Capt. James Mathewson of the Enterprise, who on the one hand knew him well enough not to doubt his veracity, and on the other hand was sufficiently influential in the town to be heard in turn with respect. The colloquy took place in an upper room of Sabins Tavern near the docks, with Smith present to corroborate virtually every statement; and it could be seen that Capt. Mathewson was tremendously impressed. Like nearly everyone else in the town, he had had black suspicions of his own anent Joseph Curwen; hence it needed only this confirmation and enlargement of data to convince him absolutely. At the end of the conference he was very grave, and enjoined strict silence upon the two younger men. He would, he said, transmit the information separately to some ten or so of the most learned and prominent citizens of Providence; ascertaining their views and following whatever advice they might have to offer. Secrecy would probably be essential in any case, for this was no matter that the town constables or militia could cope with; and above all else the excitable crowd must be kept in ignorance, lest there be enacted in these already troublous times a repetition of that frightful Salem panic of less than a century before which had first brought Curwen hither.      The right persons to tell, he believed, would be Dr. Benjamin West, whose pamphlet on the late transit of Venus proved him a scholar and keen thinker; Rev. James Manning, President of the College which had just moved up from Warren and was temporarily housed in the new King Street schoolhouse awaiting the completion of its building on the hill above Presbyterian-Lane; ex-Governor Stephen Hopkins, who had been a member of the Philosophical Society at Newport, and was a man of very broad perceptions; John Carter, publisher of the Gazette; all four of the Brown brothers, John, Joseph, Nicholas, and Moses, who formed the recognised local magnates, and of whom Joseph was an amateur scientist of parts; old Dr. Jabez Bowen, whose erudition was considerable, and who had much first-hand knowledge of Curwens odd purchases; and Capt. Abraham Whipple, a privateersman of phenomenal boldness and energy who could be counted on to lead in any active measures needed. These men, if favourable, might eventually be brought together for collective deliberation; and with them would rest the responsibility of deciding whether or not to inform the Governor of the Colony, Joseph Wanton of Newport, before taking action.      The mission of Capt. Mathewson prospered beyond his highest expectations; for whilst he found one or two of the chosen confidants somewhat sceptical of the possible ghastly side of Weedens tale, there was not one who did not think it necessary to take some sort of secret and cordinated action. Curwen, it was clear, formed a vague potential menace to the welfare of the town and Colony; and must be eliminated at any cost. Late in December 1770 a group of eminent townsmen met at the home of Stephen Hopkins and debated tentative measures. Weedens notes, which he had given to Capt. Mathewson, were carefully read; and he and Smith were summoned to give testimony anent details. Something very like fear seized the whole assemblage before the meeting was over, though there ran through that fear a grim determination which Capt. Whipples bluff and resonant profanity best expressed. They would not notify the Governor, because a more than legal course seemed necessary. With hidden powers of uncertain extent apparently at his disposal, Curwen was not a man who could safely be warned to leave town. Nameless reprisals might ensue, and even if the sinister creature complied, the removal would be no more than the shifting of an unclean burden to another place. The times were lawless, and men who had flouted the Kings revenue forces for years were not the ones to balk at sterner things when duty impelled. Curwen must be surprised at his Pawtuxet farm by a large raiding-party of seasoned privateersmen and given one decisive chance to explain himself. If he proved a madman, amusing himself with shrieks and imaginary conversations in different voices, he would be properly confined. If something graver appeared, and if the underground horrors indeed turned out to be real, he and all with him must die. It could be done quietly, and even the widow and her father need not be told how it came about.      While these serious steps were under discussion there occurred in the town an incident so terrible and inexplicable that for a time little else was mentioned for miles around. In the middle of a moonlight January night with heavy snow underfoot there resounded over the river and up the hill a shocking series of cries which brought sleepy heads to every window; and people around Weybosset Point saw a great white thing plunging frantically along the badly cleared space in front of the Turks Head. There was a baying of dogs in the distance, but this subsided as soon as the clamour of the awakened town became audible. Parties of men with lanterns and muskets hurried out to see what was happening, but nothing rewarded their search. The next morning, however, a giant, muscular body, stark naked, was found on the jams of ice around the southern piers of the Great Bridge, where the Long Dock stretched out beside Abbotts distil-house, and the identity of this object became a theme for endless speculation and whispering. It was not so much the younger as the older folk who whispered, for only in the patriarchs did that rigid face with horror-bulging eyes strike any chord of memory. They, shaking as they did so, exchanged furtive murmurs of wonder and fear; for in those stiff, hideous features lay a resemblance so marvellous as to be almost an identity - and that identity was with a man who had died full fifty years before.      Ezra Weeden was present at the finding; and remembering the baying of the night before, set out along Weybosset Street and across Muddy Dock Bridge whence the sound had come. He had a curious expectancy, and was not surprised when, reaching the edge of the settled district where the street merged into the Pawtuxet Road, he came upon some very curious tracks in the snow. The naked giant had been pursued by dogs and many booted men, and the returning tracks of the hounds and their masters could be easily traced. They had given up the chase upon coming too near the town. Weeden smiled grimly, and as a perfunctory detail traced the footprints back to their source. It was the Pawtuxet farm of Joseph Curwen, as he well knew it would be; and he would have given much had the yard been less confusingly trampled. As it was, he dared not seem too interested in full daylight. Dr. Bowen, to whom Weeden went at once with his report, performed an autopsy on the strange corpse, and discovered peculiarities which baffled him utterly. The digestive tracts of the huge man seemed never to have been in use, whilst the whole skin had a coarse, loosely knit texture impossible to account for. Impressed by what the old men whispered of this bodys likeness to the long-dead blacksmith Daniel Green, whose great-grandson Aaron Hoppin was a supercargo in Curwens employ, Weeden asked casual questions till he found where Green was buried. That night a party of ten visited the old North Burying Ground opposite Herrendens Lane and opened a grave. They found it vacant, precisely as they had expected.      Meanwhile arrangements had been made with the post riders to intercept Joseph Curwens mail, and shortly before the incident of the naked body there was found a letter from one Jedediah Orne of Salem which made the coperating citizens think deeply. Parts of it, copied and preserved in the private archives of the Smith family where Charles Ward found it, ran as follows:      \"I delight that you continue in ye Gettg at Olde Matters in your Way, and doe not think better was done at Mr. Hutchinsons in Salem-Village. Certainely, there was Nothg butt ye liveliest Awfulness in that which H. raisd upp from What he coud gather onlie a part of. What you sente, did not Worke, whether because of Any Thing missg, or because ye Wordes were not Righte from my Speakg or yr Copyg. I alone am at a Loss. I have not ye Chymicall art to followe Borellus, and owne my Self confounded by ye VII. Booke of ye Necronomicon that you recommende. But I woud have you Observe what was tolde to us aboute takg Care whom to calle up, for you are Sensible what Mr. Mather writ in ye Magnalia of  -  - , and can judge how truely that Horrendous thing is reported. I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe; by the Which I meane, Any that can in Turne call up somewhat against you, whereby your Powerfullest Devices may not be of use. Ask of the Lesser, lest the Greater shall not wish to Answer, and shall commande more than you. I was frighted when I read of your knowg what Ben Zariatnatmik hadde in his ebony Boxe, for I was conscious who must have tolde you. And againe I ask that you shalle write me as Jedediah and not Simon. In this Community a Man may not live too long, and you knowe my Plan by which I came back as my Son. I am desirous you will Acquaint me with what ye Blacke Man learnt from Sylvanus Cocidius in ye Vault, under ye Roman Wall, and will be obligd for ye Lendg of ye MS. you speak of.\"      Another and unsigned letter from Philadelphia provoked equal thought, especially for the following passage:      \"I will observe what you say respecting the sending of Accounts only by yr Vessels, but can not always be certain when to expect them. In the Matter spoke of, I require onlie one more thing; but wish to be sure I apprehend you exactly. You inform me, that no Part must be missing if the finest Effects are to be had, but you can not but know how hard it is to be sure. It seems a great Hazard and Burthen to take away the whole Box, and in Town (i.e. St. Peters, St. Pauls, St. Marys, or Christ Church) it can scarce be done at all. But I know what Imperfections were in the one I raisd up October last, and how many live Specimens you were forcd to imploy before you hit upon the right Mode in the year 1766; so will be guided by you in all Matters. I am impatient for yr Brig, and inquire daily at Mr. Biddles Wharf.\"      A third suspicious letter was in an unknown tongue and even an unknown alphabet. In the Smith diary found by Charles Ward a single oft-repeated combination of characters is clumsily copied; and authorities at Brown University have pronounced the alphabet Amharic or Abyssinian, although they do not recognise the word. None of these epistles was ever delivered to Curwen, though the disappearance of Jedediah Orne from Salem as recorded shortly afterward shewed that the Providence men took certain quiet steps. The Pennsylvania Historical Society also has some curious letters received by Dr. Shippen regarding the presence of an unwholesome character in Philadelphia. But more decisive steps were in the air, and it is in the secret assemblages of sworn and tested sailors and faithful old privateersmen in the Brown warehouses by night that we must look for the main fruits of Weedens disclosures. Slowly and surely a plan of campaign was under development which would leave no trace of Joseph Curwens noxious mysteries.      Curwen, despite all precautions, apparently felt that something was in the wind; for he was now remarked to wear an unusually worried look. His coach was seen at all hours in the town and on the Pawtuxet Road, and he dropped little by little the air of forced geniality with which he had latterly sought to combat the towns prejudice. The nearest neighbours to his farm, the Fenners, one night remarked a great shaft of light shooting into the sky from some aperture in the roof of that cryptical stone building with the high, excessively narrow windows; an event which they quickly communicated to John Brown in Providence. Mr. Brown had become the executive leader of the select group bent on Curwens extirpation, and had informed the Fenners that some action was about to be taken. This he deemed needful because of the impossibility of their not witnessing the final raid; and he explained his course by saying that Curwen was known to be a spy of the customs officers at Newport, against whom the hand of every Providence shipper, merchant, and farmer was openly or clandestinely raised. Whether the ruse was wholly believed by neighbours who had seen so many queer things is not certain; but at any rate the Fenners were willing to connect any evil with a man of such queer ways. To them Mr. Brown had entrusted the duty of watching the Curwen farmhouse, and of regularly reporting every incident which took place there.5.      The probability that Curwen was on guard and attempting unusual things, as suggested by the odd shaft of light, precipitated at last the action so carefully devised by the band of serious citizens. According to the Smith diary a company of about 100 men met at 10 p.m. on Friday, April 12th, 1771, in the great room of Thurstons Tavern at the Sign of the Golden Lion on Weybosset Point across the Bridge. Of the guiding group of prominent men in addition to the leader John Brown there were present Dr. Bowen, with his case of surgical instruments, President Manning without the great periwig (the largest in the Colonies) for which he was noted, Governor Hopkins, wrapped in his dark cloak and accompanied by his seafaring brother Esek, whom he had initiated at the last moment with the permission of the rest, John Carter, Capt. Mathewson, and Capt. Whipple, who was to lead the actual raiding party. These chiefs conferred apart in a rear chamber, after which Capt. Whipple emerged to the great room and gave the gathered seamen their last oaths and instructions. Eleazar Smith was with the leaders as they sat in the rear apartment awaiting the arrival of Ezra Weeden, whose duty was to keep track of Curwen and report the departure of his coach for the farm.      About 10:30 a heavy rumble was heard on the Great Bridge, followed by the sound of a coach in the street outside; and at that hour there was no need of waiting for Weeden in order to know that the doomed man had set out for his last night of unhallowed wizardry. A moment later, as the receding coach clattered faintly over the Muddy Dock Bridge, Weeden appeared; and the raiders fell silently into military order in the street, shouldering the firelocks, fowling-pieces, or whaling harpoons which they had with them. Weeden and Smith were with the party, and of the deliberating citizens there were present for active service Capt. Whipple, the leader, Capt. Esek Hopkins, John Carter, President Manning, Capt. Mathewson, and Dr. Bowen; together with Moses Brown, who had come up at the eleventh hour though absent from the preliminary session in the tavern. All these freemen and their hundred sailors began the long march without delay, grim and a trifle apprehensive as they left the Muddy Dock behind and mounted the gentle rise of Broad Street toward the Pawtuxet Road. Just beyond Elder Snows church some of the men turned back to take a parting look at Providence lying outspread under the early spring stars. Steeples and gables rose dark and shapely, and salt breezes swept up gently from the cove north of the Bridge. Vega was climbing above the great hill across the water, whose crest of trees was broken by the roof-line of the unfinished College edifice. At the foot of that hill, and along the narrow mounting lanes of its side, the old town dreamed; Old Providence, for whose safety and sanity so monstrous and colossal a blasphemy was about to be wiped out.      An hour and a quarter later the raiders arrived, as previously agreed, at the Fenner farmhouse; where they heard a final report on their intended victim. He had reached his farm over half an hour before, and the strange light had soon afterward shot once into the sky, but there were no lights in any visible windows. This was always the case of late. Even as this news was given another great glare arose toward the south, and the party realised that they had indeed come close to the scene of awesome and unnatural wonders. Capt. Whipple now ordered his force to separate into three divisions; one of twenty men under Eleazar Smith to strike across to the shore and guard the landing-place against possible reinforcements for Curwen until summoned by a messenger for desperate service, a second of twenty men under Capt. Esek Hopkins to steal down into the river valley behind the Curwen farm and demolish with axes or gunpowder the oaken door in the high, steep bank, and the third to close in on the house and adjacent buildings themselves. Of this division one third was to be led by Capt. Mathewson to the cryptical stone edifice with high narrow windows, another third to follow Capt. Whipple himself to the main farmhouse, and the remaining third to preserve a circle around the whole group of buildings until summoned by a final emergency signal.      The river party would break down the hillside door at the sound of a single whistle-blast, then waiting and capturing anything which might issue from the regions within. At the sound of two whistle-blasts it would advance through the aperture to oppose the enemy or join the rest of the raiding contingent. The party at the stone building would accept these respective signals in an analogous manner; forcing an entrance at the first, and at the second descending whatever passage into the ground might be discovered, and joining the general or focal warfare expected to take place within the caverns. A third or emergency signal of three blasts would summon the immediate reserve from its general guard duty; its twenty men dividing equally and entering the unknown depths through both farmhouse and stone building. Capt. Whipples belief in the existence of catacombs was absolute, and he took no alternative into consideration when making his plans. He had with him a whistle of great power and shrillness, and did not fear any upsetting or misunderstanding of signals. The final reserve at the landing, of course, was nearly out of the whistles range; hence would require a special messenger if needed for help. Moses Brown and John Carter went with Capt. Hopkins to the river-bank, while President Manning was detailed with Capt. Mathewson to the stone building. Dr. Bowen, with Ezra Weeden, remained in Capt. Whipples party which was to storm the farmhouse itself. The attack was to begin as soon as a messenger from Capt. Hopkins had joined Capt. Whipple to notify him of the river partys readiness. The leader would then deliver the loud single blast, and the various advance parties would commence their simultaneous attack on three points. Shortly before 1 a.m. the three divisions left the Fenner farmhouse; one to guard the landing, another to seek the river valley and the hillside door, and the third to subdivide and attend to the actual buildings of the Curwen farm.      Eleazar Smith, who accompanied the shore-guarding party, records in his diary an uneventful march and a long wait on the bluff by the bay; broken once by what seemed to be the distant sound of the signal whistle and again by a peculiar muffled blend of roaring and crying and a powder blast which seemed to come from the same direction. Later on one man thought he caught some distant gunshots, and still later Smith himself felt the throb of titanic and thunderous words resounding in upper air. It was just before dawn that a single haggard messenger with wild eyes and a hideous unknown odour about his clothing appeared and told the detachment to disperse quietly to their homes and never again think or speak of the nights doings or of him who had been Joseph Curwen. Something about the bearing of the messenger carried a conviction which his mere words could never have conveyed; for though he was a seaman well known to many of them, there was something obscurely lost or gained in his soul which set him for evermore apart. It was the same later on when they met other old companions who had gone into that zone of horror. Most of them had lost or gained something imponderable and indescribable. They had seen or heard or felt something which was not for human creatures, and could not forget it. From them there was never any gossip, for to even the commonest of mortal instincts there are terrible boundaries. And from that single messenger the party at the shore caught a nameless awe which almost sealed their own lips. Very few are the rumours which ever came from any of them, and Eleazar Smiths diary is the only written record which has survived from that whole expedition which set forth from the Sign of the Golden Lion under the stars.      Charles Ward, however, discovered another vague sidelight in some Fenner correspondence which he found in New London, where he knew another branch of the family had lived. It seems that the Fenners, from whose house the doomed farm was distantly visible, had watched the departing columns of raiders; and had heard very clearly the angry barking of the Curwen dogs, followed by the first shrill blast which precipitated the attack. This blast had been followed by a repetition of the great shaft of light from the stone building, and in another moment, after a quick sounding of the second signal ordering a general invasion, there had come a subdued prattle of musketry followed by a horrible roaring cry which the correspondent Luke Fenner had represented in his epistle by the characters \"Waaaahrrrrr - Rwaaahrrr\". This cry, however, had possessed a quality which no mere writing could convey, and the correspondent mentions that his mother fainted completely at the sound. It was later repeated less loudly, and further but more muffled evidences of gunfire ensued; together with a loud explosion of powder from the direction of the river. About an hour afterward all the dogs began to bark frightfully, and there were vague ground rumblings so marked that the candlesticks tottered on the mantelpiece. A strong smell of sulphur was noted; and Luke Fenners father declared that he heard the third or emergency whistle signal, though the others failed to detect it. Muffled musketry sounded again, followed by a deep scream less piercing but even more horrible than those which had preceded it; a kind of throaty, nastily plastic cough or gurgle whose quality as a scream must have come more from its continuity and psychological import than from its actual acoustic value.      Then the flaming thing burst into sight at a point where the Curwen farm ought to lie, and the human cries of desperate and frightened men were heard. Muskets flashed and cracked, and the flaming thing fell to the ground. A second flaming thing appeared, and a shriek of human origin was plainly distinguished. Fenner wrote that he could even gather a few words belched in frenzy: \"Almighty, protect thy lamb!\" Then there were more shots, and the second flaming thing fell. After that came silence for about three-quarters of an hour; at the end of which time little Arthur Fenner, Lukes brother, exclaimed that he saw a red fog going up to the stars from the accursed farm in the distance. No one but the child can testify to this, but Luke admits the significant coincidence implied by the panic of almost convulsive fright which at the same moment arched the backs and stiffened the fur of the three cats then within the room.      Five minutes later a chill wind blew up, and the air became suffused with such an intolerable stench that only the strong freshness of the sea could have prevented its being noticed by the shore party or by any wakeful souls in Pawtuxet village. This stench was nothing which any of the Fenners had ever encountered before, and produced a kind of clutching, amorphous fear beyond that of the tomb or the charnel-house. Close upon it came the awful voice which no hapless hearer will ever be able to forget. It thundered out of the sky like a doom, and windows rattled as its echoes died away. It was deep and musical; powerful as a bass organ, but evil as the forbidden books of the Arabs. What it said no man can tell, for it spoke in an unknown tongue, but this is the writing Luke Fenner set down to portray the daemoniac intonations: \"DEESMEES-JESHET-BONE DOSEFE DUVEMA-ENITEMOSS\". Not till the year 1919 did any soul link this crude transcript with anything else in mortal knowledge, but Charles Ward paled as he recognised what Mirandola had denounced in shudders as the ultimate horror among black magics incantations.      An unmistakably human shout or deep chorused scream seemed to answer this malign wonder from the Curwen farm, after which the unknown stench grew complex with an added odour equally intolerable. A wailing distinctly different from the scream now burst out, and was protracted ululantly in rising and falling paroxysms. At times it became almost articulate, though no auditor could trace any definite words; and at one point it seemed to verge toward the confines of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Then a yell of utter, ultimate fright and stark madness wrenched from scores of human throats - a yell which came strong and clear despite the depth from which it must have burst; after which darkness and silence ruled all things. Spirals of acrid smoke ascended to blot out the stars, though no flames appeared and no buildings were observed to be gone or injured on the following day.      Toward dawn two frightened messengers with monstrous and unplaceable odours saturating their clothing knocked at the Fenner door and requested a keg of rum, for which they paid very well indeed. One of them told the family that the affair of Joseph Curwen was over, and that the events of the night were not to be mentioned again. Arrogant as the order seemed, the aspect of him who gave it took away all resentment and lent it a fearsome authority; so that only these furtive letters of Luke Fenner, which he urged his Connecticut relative to destroy, remain to tell what was seen and heard. The non-compliance of that relative, whereby the letters were saved after all, has alone kept the matter from a merciful oblivion. Charles Ward had one detail to add as a result of a long canvass of Pawtuxet residents for ancestral traditions. Old Charles Slocum of that village said that there was known to his grandfather a queer rumour concerning a charred, distorted body found in the fields a week after the death of Joseph Curwen was announced. What kept the talk alive was the notion that this body, so far as could be seen in its burnt and twisted condition, was neither thoroughly human nor wholly allied to any animal which Pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about.6.      Not one man who participated in that terrible raid could ever be induced to say a word concerning it, and every fragment of the vague data which survives comes from those outside the final fighting party. There is something frightful in the care with which these actual raiders destroyed each scrap which bore the least allusion to the matter. Eight sailors had been killed, but although their bodies were not produced their families were satisfied with the statement that a clash with customs officers had occurred. The same statement also covered the numerous cases of wounds, all of which were extensively bandaged and treated only by Dr. Jabez Bowen, who had accompanied the party. Hardest to explain was the nameless odour clinging to all the raiders, a thing which was discussed for weeks. Of the citizen leaders, Capt. Whipple and Moses Brown were most severely hurt, and letters of their wives testify the bewilderment which their reticence and close guarding of their bandages produced. Psychologically every participant was aged, sobered, and shaken. It is fortunate that they were all strong men of action and simple, orthodox religionists, for with more subtle introspectiveness and mental complexity they would have fared ill indeed. President Manning was the most disturbed; but even he outgrew the darkest shadow, and smothered memories in prayers. Every man of those leaders had a stirring part to play in later years, and it is perhaps fortunate that this is so. Little more than a twelvemonth afterward Capt. Whipple led the mob who burnt the revenue ship Gaspee, and in this bold act we may trace one step in the blotting out of unwholesome images.      There was delivered to the widow of Joseph Curwen a sealed leaden coffin of curious design, obviously found ready on the spot when needed, in which she was told her husbands body lay. He had, it was explained, been killed in a customs battle about which it was not politic to give details. More than this no tongue ever uttered of Joseph Curwens end, and Charles Ward had only a single hint wherewith to construct a theory. This hint was the merest thread - a shaky underscoring of a passage in Jedediah Ornes confiscated letter to Curwen, as partly copied in Ezra Weedens handwriting. The copy was found in the possession of Smiths descendants; and we are left to decide whether Weeden gave it to his companion after the end, as a mute clue to the abnormality which had occurred, or whether, as is more probable, Smith had it before, and added the underscoring himself from what he had managed to extract from his friend by shrewd guessing and adroit cross-questioning. The underlined passage is merely this:      \"I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe; by the Which I meane, Any that can in Turne call up somewhat against you, whereby your Powerfullest Devices may not be of use. Ask of the Lesser, lest the Greater shall not wish to Answer, and shall commande more than you.\"In the light of this passage, and reflecting on what last unmentionable allies a beaten man might try to summon in his direst extremity, Charles Ward may well have wondered whether any citizen of Providence killed Joseph Curwen.      The deliberate effacement of every memory of the dead man from Providence life and annals was vastly aided by the influence of the raiding leaders. They had not at first meant to be so thorough, and had allowed the widow and her father and child to remain in ignorance of the true conditions; but Capt. Tillinghast was an astute man, and soon uncovered enough rumours to whet his horror and cause him to demand that his daughter and granddaughter change their name, burn the library and all remaining papers, and chisel the inscription from the slate slab above Joseph Curwens grave. He knew Capt. Whipple well, and probably extracted more hints from that bluff mariner than anyone else ever gained respecting the end of the accused sorcerer.      From that time on the obliteration of Curwens memory became increasingly rigid, extending at last by common consent even to the town records and files of the Gazette. It can be compared in spirit only to the hush that lay on Oscar Wildes name for a decade after his disgrace, and in extent only to the fate of that sinful King of Runazar in Lord Dunsanys tale, whom the Gods decided must not only cease to be, but must cease ever to have been.      Mrs. Tillinghast, as the widow became known after 1772, sold the house in Olney Court and resided with her father in Powers Lane till her death in 1817. The farm at Pawtuxet, shunned by every living soul, remained to moulder through the years; and seemed to decay with unaccountable rapidity. By 1780 only the stone and brickwork were standing, and by 1800 even these had fallen to shapeless heaps. None ventured to pierce the tangled shrubbery on the river-bank behind which the hillside door may have lain, nor did any try to frame a definite image of the scenes amidst which Joseph Curwen departed from the horrors he had wrought.      Only robust old Capt. Whipple was heard by alert listeners to mutter once in a while to himself, \"Pox on that  -  -  - , but he had no business to laugh while he screamed. Twas as though the damnd  -  -  -  had someat up his sleeve. For half a crown Id burn his  -  -  -  house.\"", "VII.Yet all this was only the prologue of the actual Dunwich horror. Formalities were gone through by bewildered officials, abnormal details were duly kept from press and public, and men were sent to Dunwich and Aylesbury to look up property and notify any who might be heirs of the late Wilbur Whateley. They found the countryside in great agitation, both because of the growing rumblings beneath the domed hills, and because of the unwonted stench and the surging, lapping sounds which came increasingly from the great empty shell formed by Whateley’s boarded-up farmhouse. Earl Sawyer, who tended the horse and cattle during Wilbur’s absence, had developed a woefully acute case of nerves. The officials devised excuses not to enter the noisome boarded place; and were glad to confine their survey of the deceased’s living quarters, the newly mended sheds, to a single visit. They filed a ponderous report at the court-house in Aylesbury, and litigations concerning heirship are said to be still in progress amongst the innumerable Whateleys, decayed and undecayed, of the upper Miskatonic valley.      An almost interminable manuscript in strange characters, written in a huge ledger and adjudged a sort of diary because of the spacing and the variations in ink and penmanship, presented a baffling puzzle to those who found it on the old bureau which served as its owner’s desk. After a week of debate it was sent to Miskatonic University, together with the deceased’s collection of strange books, for study and possible translation; but even the best linguists soon saw that it was not likely to be unriddled with ease. No trace of the ancient gold with which Wilbur and Old Whateley always paid their debts has yet been discovered.      It was in the dark of September 9th that the horror broke loose. The hill noises had been very pronounced during the evening, and dogs barked frantically all night. Early risers on the 10th noticed a peculiar stench in the air. About seven o’clock Luther Brown, the hired boy at George Corey’s, between Cold Spring Glen and the village, rushed frenziedly back from his morning trip to Ten-Acre Meadow with the cows. He was almost convulsed with fright as he stumbled into the kitchen; and in the yard outside the no less frightened herd were pawing and lowing pitifully, having followed the boy back in the panic they shared with him. Between gasps Luther tried to stammer out his tale to Mrs. Corey.      “Up thar in the rud beyont the glen, Mis’ Corey—they’s suthin’ ben thar! It smells like thunder, an’ all the bushes an’ little trees is pushed back from the rud like they’d a haouse ben moved along of it. An’ that ain’t the wust, nuther. They’s prints in the rud, Mis’ Corey—great raound prints as big as barrel-heads, all sunk daown deep like a elephant had ben along, only they’s a sight more nor four feet could make! I looked at one or two afore I run, an’ I see every one was covered with lines spreadin’ aout from one place, like as if big palm-leaf fans—twict or three times as big as any they is—hed of ben paounded daown into the rud. An’ the smell was awful, like what it is araound Wizard Whateley’s ol’ haouse. . . .”      Here he faltered, and seemed to shiver afresh with the fright that had sent him flying home. Mrs. Corey, unable to extract more information, began telephoning the neighbours; thus starting on its rounds the overture of panic that heralded the major terrors. When she got Sally Sawyer, housekeeper at Seth Bishop’s, the nearest place to Whateley’s, it became her turn to listen instead of transmit; for Sally’s boy Chauncey, who slept poorly, had been up on the hill toward Whateley’s, and had dashed back in terror after one look at the place, and at the pasturage where Mr. Bishop’s cows had been left out all night.      “Yes, Mis’ Corey,” came Sally’s tremulous voice over the party wire, “Cha’ncey he just come back a-postin’, and couldn’t haff talk fer bein’ scairt! He says Ol’ Whateley’s haouse is all blowed up, with the timbers scattered raound like they’d ben dynamite inside; only the bottom floor ain’t through, but is all covered with a kind o’ tar-like stuff that smells awful an’ drips daown offen the aidges onto the graoun’ whar the side timbers is blown away. An’ they’s awful kinder marks in the yard, tew—great raound marks bigger raound than a hogshead, an’ all sticky with stuff like is on the blowed-up haouse. Cha’ncey he says they leads off into the medders, whar a great swath wider’n a barn is matted daown, an’ all the stun walls tumbled every whichway wherever it goes.      “An’ he says, says he, Mis’ Corey, as haow he sot to look fer Seth’s caows, frighted ez he was; an’ faound ’em in the upper pasture nigh the Devil’s Hop Yard in an awful shape. Haff on ’em’s clean gone, an’ nigh haff o’ them that’s left is sucked most dry o’ blood, with sores on ’em like they’s ben on Whateley’s cattle ever senct Lavinny’s black brat was born. Seth he’s gone aout naow to look at ’em, though I’ll vaow he wun’t keer ter git very nigh Wizard Whateley’s! Cha’ncey didn’t look keerful ter see whar the big matted-daown swath led arter it leff the pasturage, but he says he thinks it p’inted towards the glen rud to the village.      “I tell ye, Mis’ Corey, they’s suthin’ abroad as hadn’t orter be abroad, an’ I for one think that black Wilbur Whateley, as come to the bad eend he desarved, is at the bottom of the breedin’ of it. He wa’n’t all human hisself, I allus says to everybody; an’ I think he an’ Ol’ Whateley must a raised suthin’ in that there nailed-up haouse as ain’t even so human as he was. They’s allus ben unseen things araound Dunwich—livin’ things—as ain’t human an’ ain’t good fer human folks.      “The graoun’ was a-talkin’ lass night, an’ towards mornin’ Cha’ncey he heerd the whippoorwills so laoud in Col’ Spring Glen he couldn’t sleep nun. Then he thought he heerd another faint-like saound over towards Wizard Whateley’s—a kinder rippin’ or tearin’ o’ wood, like some big box er crate was bein’ opened fur off. What with this an’ that, he didn’t git to sleep at all till sunup, an’ no sooner was he up this mornin’, but he’s got to go over to Whateley’s an’ see what’s the matter. He see enough, I tell ye, Mis’ Corey! This dun’t mean no good, an’ I think as all the men-folks ought to git up a party an’ do suthin’. I know suthin’ awful’s abaout, an’ feel my time is nigh, though only Gawd knows jest what it is.      “Did your Luther take accaount o’ whar them big tracks led tew? No? Wal, Mis’ Corey, ef they was on the glen rud this side o’ the glen, an’ ain’t got to your haouse yet, I calc’late they must go into the glen itself. They would do that. I allus says Col’ Spring Glen ain’t no healthy nor decent place. The whippoorwills an’ fireflies there never did act like they was creaters o’ Gawd, an’ they’s them as says ye kin hear strange things a-rushin’ an’ a-talkin’ in the air daown thar ef ye stand in the right place, atween the rock falls an’ Bear’s Den.”      By that noon fully three-quarters of the men and boys of Dunwich were trooping over the roads and meadows between the new-made Whateley ruins and Cold Spring Glen, examining in horror the vast, monstrous prints, the maimed Bishop cattle, the strange, noisome wreck of the farmhouse, and the bruised, matted vegetation of the fields and roadsides. Whatever had burst loose upon the world had assuredly gone down into the great sinister ravine; for all the trees on the banks were bent and broken, and a great avenue had been gouged in the precipice-hanging underbrush. It was as though a house, launched by an avalanche, had slid down through the tangled growths of the almost vertical slope. From below no sound came, but only a distant, undefinable foetor; and it is not to be wondered at that the men preferred to stay on the edge and argue, rather than descend and beard the unknown Cyclopean horror in its lair. Three dogs that were with the party had barked furiously at first, but seemed cowed and reluctant when near the glen. Someone telephoned the news to the Aylesbury Transcript; but the editor, accustomed to wild tales from Dunwich, did no more than concoct a humorous paragraph about it; an item soon afterward reproduced by the Associated Press.      That night everyone went home, and every house and barn was barricaded as stoutly as possible. Needless to say, no cattle were allowed to remain in open pasturage. About two in the morning a frightful stench and the savage barking of the dogs awakened the household at Elmer Frye’s, on the eastern edge of Cold Spring Glen, and all agreed that they could hear a sort of muffled swishing or lapping sound from somewhere outside. Mrs. Frye proposed telephoning the neighbours, and Elmer was about to agree when the noise of splintering wood burst in upon their deliberations. It came, apparently, from the barn; and was quickly followed by a hideous screaming and stamping amongst the cattle. The dogs slavered and crouched close to the feet of the fear-numbed family. Frye lit a lantern through force of habit, but knew it would be death to go out into that black farmyard. The children and the womenfolk whimpered, kept from screaming by some obscure, vestigial instinct of defence which told them their lives depended on silence. At last the noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful moaning, and a great snapping, crashing, and crackling ensued. The Fryes, huddled together in the sitting-room, did not dare to move until the last echoes died away far down in Cold Spring Glen. Then, amidst the dismal moans from the stable and the daemoniac piping of late whippoorwills in the glen, Selina Frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she could of the second phase of the horror.      The next day all the countryside was in a panic; and cowed, uncommunicative groups came and went where the fiendish thing had occurred. Two titan swaths of destruction stretched from the glen to the Frye farmyard, monstrous prints covered the bare patches of ground, and one side of the old red barn had completely caved in. Of the cattle, only a quarter could be found and identified. Some of these were in curious fragments, and all that survived had to be shot. Earl Sawyer suggested that help be asked from Aylesbury or Arkham, but others maintained it would be of no use. Old Zebulon Whateley, of a branch that hovered about half way between soundness and decadence, made darkly wild suggestions about rites that ought to be practiced on the hill-tops. He came of a line where tradition ran strong, and his memories of chantings in the great stone circles were not altogether connected with Wilbur and his grandfather.      Darkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organise for real defence. In a few cases closely related families would band together and watch in the gloom under one roof; but in general there was only a repetition of the barricading of the night before, and a futile, ineffective gesture of loading muskets and setting pitchforks handily about. Nothing, however, occurred except some hill noises; and when the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had gone as swiftly as it had come. There were even bold souls who proposed an offensive expedition down in the glen, though they did not venture to set an actual example to the still reluctant majority.      When night came again the barricading was repeated, though there was less huddling together of families. In the morning both the Frye and the Seth Bishop households reported excitement among the dogs and vague sounds and stenches from afar, while early explorers noted with horror a fresh set of the monstrous tracks in the road skirting Sentinel Hill. As before, the sides of the road shewed a bruising indicative of the blasphemously stupendous bulk of the horror; whilst the conformation of the tracks seemed to argue a passage in two directions, as if the moving mountain had come from Cold Spring Glen and returned to it along the same path. At the base of the hill a thirty-foot swath of crushed shrubbery saplings led steeply upward, and the seekers gasped when they saw that even the most perpendicular places did not deflect the inexorable trail. Whatever the horror was, it could scale a sheer stony cliff of almost complete verticality; and as the investigators climbed around to the hill’s summit by safer routes they saw that the trail ended—or rather, reversed—there.      It was here that the Whateleys used to build their hellish fires and chant their hellish rituals by the table-like stone on May-Eve and Hallowmass. Now that very stone formed the centre of a vast space thrashed around by the mountainous horror, whilst upon its slightly concave surface was a thick and foetid deposit of the same tarry stickiness observed on the floor of the ruined Whateley farmhouse when the horror escaped. Men looked at one another and muttered. Then they looked down the hill. Apparently the horror had descended by a route much the same as that of its ascent. To speculate was futile. Reason, logic, and normal ideas of motivation stood confounded. Only old Zebulon, who was not with the group, could have done justice to the situation or suggested a plausible explanation.      Thursday night began much like the others, but it ended less happily. The whippoorwills in the glen had screamed with such unusual persistence that many could not sleep, and about 3 A.M. all the party telephones rang tremulously. Those who took down their receivers heard a fright-mad voice shriek out, “Help, oh, my Gawd! . . .” and some thought a crashing sound followed the breaking off of the exclamation. There was nothing more. No one dared do anything, and no one knew till morning whence the call came. Then those who had heard it called everyone on the line, and found that only the Fryes did not reply. The truth appeared an hour later, when a hastily assembled group of armed men trudged out to the Frye place at the head of the glen. It was horrible, yet hardly a surprise. There were more swaths and monstrous prints, but there was no longer any house. It had caved in like an egg-shell, and amongst the ruins nothing living or dead could be discovered. Only a stench and a tarry stickiness. The Elmer Fryes had been erased from Dunwich."]}
{"id": "EN048", "pair": ["Spoonbill Village, Northernmost Quang Binh Province, SRV.June 30, 2011.Considering their first encounter, this meeting was going rather well.\"No, no, I assure you that I have had quite enough… well, if you insist…\" In the course of explaining his task to the household he would be staying in, Joseph Clayton had been offered tea at the behest of the mistress of the household and all three times, he had acquiesced. She was attending her husband in fine cotton clothes of white and black, the cut more resembling something out of Javanese dancing than anything worn in Indochina during the past thousand years. Their son, called from his lessons for the presentation, was sitting at the far end of the room, listening to what was going on. While he had repeated much the same spiel that Professor Andover to the houses three inhabitants, he had sipped at his bowl almost automatically as one would with water, clear onto what was now his fourth helping. Although not unpleasant, the drink had considerably more kick to it than even the strong brews typical of Vietnamese green tea.What perplexed Joseph was that he couldnt identify the extra ingredient. It wasnt peppers, having no discernible remains or even the raw chemical heat of capsaicin. It could be ginger, but the heat was of an utterly different kind than any ginger he had ever experienced.Then again, the additive could just as well be Tarantula venom given the figure he was giving his introduction to.His name, as he had given it, was Noc. He was the most experience hunter, archer and scout of the village, was of an incredibly ancient lineage and, incidentally, was the first person of this strange, isolated village that he had seen. His tattoos all featured arachnid themes of legs, webbing and fangs and his eyes…Marie had mentioned that some of the warriors practiced sorcery with mutative effects. If that was what caused Nocs eyes to become all black, seemingly all pupils and tempting Joseph to mentally refer to the man as \"Spider Eye\", then maybe those three weirdoes they caught in the biology labs back in February were onto something after all.Sitting in the main reception area of the home, replete with decorations of strange latticed designs and black lacquer, Joseph watched carefully as Noc finished examining one of his bowstrings before his eyes darted around the room. On the wall, several bows hung in their unstrung state: the white and banded flatbow he had first witnessed, several simple bows of light colored cane and even one recurve bow made of dark red hardwood.\"So that is your request: to hear the stories of our history, to observe the operation of a household of status and to… take part in our activities?\" Throughout the introduction of this man and the repetition he had given of the Professors offer, Noc had examined all aspects of him closely… and had not been impressed. He had some muscle tone, but everything else about him absolutely screamed that he was some sort of priest or urban scribe in training. Besides, the combination of the girls cues toward him and his reaction to his tea made it clear: if the boy had been a virgin, steam would have been pouring out of his ears. That made things difficult (and potentially dangerous) for everyone.Besides, very few people in this village held any affection at all for someone with Josephs skin tone.After receiving affirmation of Josephs duties, Noc laid out the rules. \"Know this: you will record the histories when they are told to you. You shall ask questions when you are allowed and you shall observe what you shall participate in what you are allowed to participate in. No pestering me with questions, no sneaking around trying to observe the women and children and no and I mean no trying to wheedle out information through trickery. We had quite enough trouble with that sort of thing the last time around.\"Joseph was immediately insulted, even though he did not how it as he automatically agreed. Still, two things bothered him. First, underneath the gold and bronze bangles that decorated the forearms and ankles of Nocs wife, Joseph had noticed strange scars, akin in shape to the marks that sperm whales bore from their battles with giant squid.Second… what did Noc mean by the last time around?That Night…As he lay awake, Joseph realized how exhausting the day had been. As it turned out, he was probably doing to spend most of his time in this house as a sort of a servant: documenting and participating in cooking and chores, handling domestic duties and picking little things up only as Nocs wife deemed appropriate. No real questions answered, no interesting discoveries or scandals or surprises… just ordinary ethnographic work.It wasnt made any better that his libido was getting annoyed at the busy signals it kept receiving. However, there had been no real opportunity to talk with Marie after last night, with all the revelations of cannibalism and sorcery and other things that probably should have made his stomach turn./Maybe it would be better if they had made your stomach turn./ Came a wheedling little multi-voiced dialogue from inside his head… from inside his head, but not originating from him.Oh no. Joseph thought with a mental groan. Not you idiots again! I thought you gave it up after the last time./The last time? You mean when you were in the thrall of carnal lusts, disgracing your heritage?/ The dominant voice changed from one of the old WASP lords to that of an aristocratic dowager that had been ancient even when Granny Clara had been a girl. /Maybe now that you know what her kind get up to, you will listen to reason and find a girl more suitable to a young man of your station./Her parents are just as middle class as mine are, thank you all very much. Joseph snarked back mentally, fully knowing how these… wraiths felt about his relationship with Marie and savoring the thought of causing them anguish./You know full well what is meant. What is not understood is why the other girl did not so arouse your… passions./Oh please, her family is just as drenched in sorcery as these guys, its just that theyre more polite about who they slice open. Besides, I dont really think youd have acted any differently if it had been Tracy Id been with that night instead of Marie, inbred and rural as she apparently is. He remembered clearly that night: how these voices (who he was fairly sure were not the products of schizophrenia despite superficially similar symptomatology), had come to him in the midst of what should have been unimaginable passion and communion with his girlfriend (though with was much more awkward, rushed and possibly painful than desired). Even as the passion mounted, their insults became worse: the taunts, the archaic, hateful rhetoric, the most vicious slurs directed against Marie and him. And yet he had forged on, continuing despite the rising chorus of insane voices inside his head… or even because of them, for as they blasphemed against all that Marie was, all the little things that made Joseph love her all the more, he could tell that his defiance was causing them actual pain and torment… and even through the pleasures of the flesh, he took small, sadistic delights in causing pain and anguish to these assholes who claimed authority as his forbearers.Now Joseph was getting annoyed… and cranky. Look, I dont have to listen to you idiots, even if you do claim to be my ancestors. You came from a completely different world whose rules do not apply to me. Also, the instruments of your authority are gone: no money, no status, no companies or contacts or friends in high places. All thats left are a bunch of ugly little voices in the wind. Why dont you all just blow away? He was tired of his, of having to listen to these inane snobs that he had learned to loath in the abstract and now hated in the concrete. He hated their hate-filled dismissals of all other peoples and cultures, their smug superiority and the generalized arrogance that seemed to drip from the voices.When they didnt respond, Joseph took it as a sign. \"Good.\" He said aloud, as softly as his sense of satisfaction allowed.", "August, 1346- The Mongol warriors watched as a burning object fell, seemingly from Heaven itself, near the encampment besieging Caffa. It was a good omen, a symbol of victory against the trading town that resisted them. The gods had shown their light upon the invaders...Baoht Zuqqa-Mogg pulled himself painfully from the burning pit of molten glass, his many clawed limbs scrambling for purchase, his massive front claws pulling his heavy body from the pit. He had floated through space for so long, too long... Shaggai was gone, his home was gone. The accursed harbinger, Ghroth, had shone its killing red light upon the surface of that world, slaying the Shan and awakening The Worm That Gnaws in The Night. Baoht Zuqqa-Mogg had fought valiantly to preserve his world, but failed, and had been flung into space as the world imploded beneath the power of The Worm. He stood upon his many, spider-like legs, relishing the feeling of solid ground beneath his claws, and straightened his three pairs of barbed, ragged wings. Thousand of eyes peered out from between feelers in a walnut-shaped head, his venom dripping from his mandibles, sizzling the warm ground beneath. A new world, a new home.Home.The few who saw the terrible dragon fly over head knew that this was no divine harbinger of victory. The even fewer who lived long enough to tell of it before being felled by the plague that followed rambled about a giant, winged scorpion. Within days everyone in the camp had contracted the plague, and soon, so had everyone in the besieged town.Swarms of small insects, attracted by some scent, some pheromone, followed in Baoht Zuqq-Moggs wake. He barely noticed them, he was intoxicated by his new world, so warm, so pleasant. There were abundant swamps here, he could feel it. Places to rest, to heal his battle-wounds...The Italian merchants of Caffa fled in their ships, bringing with them the fleas and rats that carried the Black Death, guiding it to new ports. The plague spread like wildfire, carried by vermin and fear. Kings and Churches tried to still the tide of death, and failed. People blamed Jews, Romany, paupers, lepers and foreigners, claiming they had poisoned their waters or placed curses upon them, and many were claimed by mob-violence and the disease of hate before they could be claimed by The Black Death. By 1350, over a million people had died, half of Europe was dead, society was in tatters and fear ruled over all.Baoht Zuqqa-Mogg was mildly curious about these strange beings, he probed them with his mind, learning about them... These primitive creatures, these humans, seemed to be dying out. Some plague was ravaging them. But that was not his concern. Other beings, similar to the humans, yet different, came forth to feed on the dead and offer up praise to him. These beings, these... Ghouls, called him The Provider. They believed that he caused the deaths that fed them so well. He welcomed their praise, but he was tired, and sought a place to rest...Finally, a land of steaming jungles lay before him, thick swampland beckoned with its warmth and comfort. The Great Old One settled into deep, warm mud, and slept, dreaming. A plague raged across Africa, but he knew it not..."]}
{"id": "EN063", "pair": ["The world we live in is not as it seems. I, James White, write this document so that others may be made aware of what I have experienced and know of the dangers that lurk beneath our limited perception of \"reality\". Whether you believe me or not, dear reader, is up to you. I only ask that you read what I write with an open mind since I write, not for my own gain, but to warn you of what I can only describe as \"pure evil\".I had never heard of the \"Cult of Cthulhu\" before I began university in the late summer of 2012. I was only eighteen years old, an atheist, and dogmatically pursued scientific understanding and knowledge. At that time, I was not in the least bit interested in weird cults and other religious movements, which I simply dismissed as primitive superstition. Had I but known what I would encounter, I would have burnt the science textbook, prayed to God for the strength not to crumble into insanity and got as far away from that university as I could!The strange happenings started less than two months into my first term. I had been put into student accommodation and shared a corridor with four other boys and two girls. I had got to know my flatmates very well until all of a sudden, one of the boys by the name of Jonathan Mears disappeared. This wasnt looked upon as weird at first since Jonathan was the quiet type anyway and often spent long hours alone in his room. The suspicions arose however, when he hadnt shown his face for three days. His absence was brought up one evening as we sat in a communal area.\"Hes probably just been very busy lately,\" my best friend, Jacob Shields, said. \"You know Jonathan. When he sets his mind on something, he doesnt stop until hes achieved whatever hes trying to do.\"\"Isnt it a bit strange though?\" Annie Roberts, a lovely blonde girl from the room directly across the corridor asked. \"I mean, hes in our corridor and we havent seen him for ages. Not even in the kitchen or lecture halls.\"\"It isnt like him to miss a lecture,\" I agreed. Jacob merely waved these concerns away.\"If we havent seen him by tomorrow evening, well go to the reception and see whats happening,\" he said cheerfully.But Jonathan didnt show up the following day and, as planned, my entire corridor went to the reception desk to ask if anything had happened to him. The receptionist, an elderly lady, checked through the files on a computer before looking up at us.\"Im afraid he has left the university,\" she informed us. \"He dropped out four days ago.\"\"Well there you go!\" Jacob exclaimed. \"Nothing to worry about!\"But there was something to worry about. Even though I now had every reason to think that Jonathan was fine, I couldnt shake that feeling of foreboding. He had seemed happy in university and was consistently getting high marks so I resolved to check things out for myself.I waited until 3:00 the following morning, and in the darkness, I tiptoed along the corridor to Jonathans room. Using a paperclip, I carefully picked the lock on his door and let myself in. I closed the door behind me and switched on the light. The sight that greeted me came as a huge shock. Clothes still lay on the floor, the bed was made, books were still on the shelves and a laptop was still humming gently on the cluttered desk. In short, it looked as though Jonathan was simply out of the room. If he had gone home, why did he leave all his things behind? And if he hadnt, where was he and why did the university records state that he had? Deeply concerned, I left the room and returned to my own. I lay awake in the darkness pondering the thoughts in my head and finally decided that I needed to find out what had happened and that I would do so alone...", "The following day dragged by without incident. I could not concentrate in the lectures and did not do any of the coursework I had been set for I was too highly anticipating the arrival of darkness and my investigation into the disappearance of Jonathan Mears.When night finally came, I once again let myself into Jonathans room. Looking around the place, I noticed the laptop on the desk and decided to check it. Finding nothing unusual, I started to go through his notebooks trying to find some clue as to where he had gone. It was in these notebooks that I had my first encounter with the demon known as \"Cthulhu\". In one of them was the image of a creature, the likes of which I had never before seen in my life. It was humanoid in its basic appearance but had claws on its hands and toes, large dragon-like wings and a bulbous head with tentacles not unlike an octopus. It was neatly coloured in green and beneath the drawing was written the words \"CTHULHU CULT\".My initial thoughts on this were that the image was simply a figment of Jonathans imagination. But however much I tried to dismiss it and look elsewhere, something about the creature depicted on the page forced me to continue looking. It was the eyes of the monster that most entranced me. I felt myself becoming hypnotised as the thing, whatever it was, drew me into the page with its penetrating stare. Those eyes, they seemed so alive, so real…Suddenly, I dropped the book and leapt backwards in fright, only barely managing to stifle a scream. I was certain that the image had moved, though my rational mind told me that the notion was ludicrous. The tentacles around the figures head had seemed to extend out of the page towards my face. However, I tricked myself into believing that I was only seeing things as a result of tiredness.I had only just comforted myself with this idea when I heard hushed voices from outside the door. I recognised them instantly as Jacob and Annie. I kept quiet, but darted under the bed when I realised to my horror that they were entering the room. If they had something to do with Jonathans disappearance, the last thing I wanted was for them to see me poking around in here. My fears about their involvement in this were soon confirmed when Jacob bent down and picked up the notebook Id dropped on the floor.\"Someones been here,\" he stated in an angry tone of voice Id never heard him use before and with that, the pair left the room. I clambered out from under the bed to find that all the notebooks and a number of the books from the shelf were missing. I could only guess that that was the reason Jacob and Annie were here in the first place. Although what they wanted them for was a mystery.And then I did the one thing I know now I should never have done. I decided to follow Jacob and Annie. I could only make out their silhouettes in the darkness when I left my Hall and followed them across the campus. I managed to get quite close, but remained far enough away so that they didnt sense my presence. Then all of a sudden, they turned off the road and headed towards a nearby wood. As we ventured further into the wood, I began to see a dim red glow and hear chants, screams and the banging of drums. When I finally came in sight of the source of the noise, I became frozen in terror.There was a ring of fire surrounding a tall obelisk, upon which sat a statue of the image I had seen in Jonathans notebook. The eyes of the statue emitted a bright red glow and it seemed to be moving to the beat of the drums in the firelight. A few dozen people danced maniacally around the fire and there, chained to the obelisk, was Jonathan. Or what was left of him anyway. His decapitated form was upside down, his chest split open. His ribcage had been cleaved in half lengthways and adorned the obelisk near the top. At the base of the obelisk was a small pile of blood, bones and organs, and it seemed as though the intestines had been split into many parts which the cultists were wearing as belts. Jonathans head was nowhere to be seen. And his was not the only corpse there. The glade was filled with corpses hanging from the trees and offal covered the floor. The whole place stunk of a slaughterhouse and, unable to contain it any longer, I screamed. Immediately, a few of the cultists, including Jacob and Annie, turned in my direction and glared at me with pure hate. I turned and ran, ran as fast I possibly could away from that degenerate ritual."]}

She was attending her husband in fine cotton clothes of white and black, the cut more resembling something out of Javanese dancing than anything worn in Indochina during the past thousand years. Their son, called from his lessons for the presentation, was sitting at the far end of the room, listening to what was going on. While he had repeated much the same spiel that Professor Andover to the houses three inhabitants, he had sipped at his bowl almost automatically as one would with water, clear onto what was now his fourth helping. Although not unpleasant, the drink had considerably more kick to it than even the strong brews typical of Vietnamese green tea.What perplexed Joseph was that he couldnt identify the extra ingredient. It wasnt peppers, having no discernible remains or even the raw chemical heat of capsaicin. It could be ginger, but the heat was of an utterly different kind than any ginger he had ever experienced.Then again, the additive could just as well be Tarantula venom given the figure he was giving his introduction to.His name, as he had given it, was Noc.

If that was what caused Nocs eyes to become all black, seemingly all pupils and tempting Joseph to mentally refer to the man as \"Spider Eye\", then maybe those three weirdoes they caught in the biology labs back in February were onto something after all.Sitting in the main reception area of the home, replete with decorations of strange latticed designs and black lacquer, Joseph watched carefully as Noc finished examining one of his bowstrings before his eyes darted around the room. On the wall, several bows hung in their unstrung state: the white and banded flatbow he had first witnessed, several simple bows of light colored cane and even one recurve bow made of dark red hardwood.\"So that is your request: to hear the stories of our history, to observe the operation of a household of status and to… take part in our activities?\" Throughout the introduction of this man and the repetition he had given of the Professors offer, Noc had examined all aspects of him closely… and had not been impressed. He had some muscle tone, but everything else about him absolutely screamed that he was some sort of priest or urban scribe in training. Besides, the combination of the girls cues toward him and his reaction to his tea made it clear: if the boy had been a virgin, steam would have been pouring out of his ears. That made things difficult (and potentially dangerous) for everyone.Besides, very few people in this village held any affection at all for someone with Josephs skin tone.After receiving affirmation of Josephs duties, Noc laid out the rules. \"Know this: you will record the histories when they are told to you. You shall ask questions when you are allowed and you shall observe what you shall participate in what you are allowed to participate in. No pestering me with questions, no sneaking around trying to observe the women and children and no and I mean no trying to wheedle out information through trickery. We had quite enough trouble with that sort of thing the last time around.\"Joseph was immediately insulted, even though he did not how it as he automatically agreed. Still, two things bothered him. First, underneath the gold and bronze bangles that decorated the forearms and ankles of Nocs wife, Joseph had noticed strange scars, akin in shape to the marks that sperm whales bore from their battles with giant squid.Second… what did Noc mean by the last time around?That Night…As he lay awake, Joseph realized how exhausting the day had been. As it turned out, he was probably doing to spend most of his time in this house as a sort of a servant: documenting and participating in cooking and chores, handling domestic duties and picking little things up only as Nocs wife deemed appropriate. No real questions answered, no interesting discoveries or scandals or surprises… just ordinary ethnographic work.It wasnt made any better that his libido was getting annoyed at the busy signals it kept receiving. However, there had been no real opportunity to talk with Marie after last night, with all the revelations of cannibalism and sorcery and other things that probably should have made his stomach turn./Maybe it would be better if they had made your stomach turn./ Came a wheedling little multi-voiced dialogue from inside his head… from inside his head, but not originating from him.Oh no. Joseph thought with a mental groan. Not you idiots again! I thought you gave it up after the last time./The last time? You mean when you were in the thrall of carnal lusts, disgracing your heritage?/ The dominant voice changed from one of the old WASP lords to that of an aristocratic dowager that had been ancient even when Granny Clara had been a girl. /Maybe now that you know what her kind get up to, you will listen to reason and find a girl more suitable to a young man of your station./Her parents are just as middle class as mine are, thank you all very much. Joseph snarked back mentally, fully knowing how these… wraiths felt about his relationship with Marie and savoring the thought of causing them anguish./You know full well what is meant. What is not understood is why the other girl did not so arouse your… passions./Oh please, her family is just as drenched in sorcery as these guys, its just that theyre more polite about who they slice open. Besides, I dont really think youd have acted any differently if it had been Tracy Id been with that night instead of Marie, inbred and rural as she apparently is. He remembered clearly that night: how these voices (who he was fairly sure were not the products of schizophrenia despite superficially similar symptomatology), had come to him in the midst of what should have been unimaginable passion and communion with his girlfriend (though with was much more awkward, rushed and possibly painful than desired). Even as the passion mounted, their insults became worse: the taunts, the archaic, hateful rhetoric, the most vicious slurs directed against Marie and him. And yet he had forged on, continuing despite the rising chorus of insane voices inside his head… or even because of them, for as they blasphemed against all that Marie was, all the little things that made Joseph love her all the more, he could tell that his defiance was causing them actual pain and torment… and even through the pleasures of the flesh, he took small, sadistic delights in causing pain and anguish to these assholes who claimed authority as his forbearers.Now Joseph was getting annoyed… and cranky. Look, I dont have to listen to you idiots, even if you do claim to be my ancestors. You came from a completely different world whose rules do not apply to me. Also, the instruments of your authority are gone: no money, no status, no companies or contacts or friends in high places. All thats left are a bunch of ugly little voices in the wind. Why dont you all just blow away? He was tired of his, of having to listen to these inane snobs that he had learned to loath in the abstract and now hated in the concrete. He hated their hate-filled dismissals of all other peoples and cultures, their smug superiority and the generalized arrogance that seemed to drip from the voices.When they didnt respond, Joseph took it as a sign. \"Good.\" He said aloud, as softly as his sense of satisfaction allowed.", "VI.The Dunwich horror itself came between Lammas and the equinox in 1928, and Dr. Armitage was among those who witnessed its monstrous prologue. He had heard, meanwhile, of Whateley’s grotesque trip to Cambridge, and of his frantic efforts to borrow or copy from the Necronomicon at the Widener Library. Those efforts had been in vain, since Armitage had issued warnings of the keenest intensity to all librarians having charge of the dreaded volume. Wilbur had been shockingly nervous at Cambridge; anxious for the book, yet almost equally anxious to get home again, as if he feared the results of being away long.      Early in August the half-expected outcome developed, and in the small hours of the 3d Dr. Armitage was awakened suddenly by the wild, fierce cries of the savage watchdog on the college campus. Deep and terrible, the snarling, half-mad growls and barks continued; always in mounting volume, but with hideously significant pauses. Then there rang out a scream from a wholly different throat—such a scream as roused half the sleepers of Arkham and haunted their dreams ever afterward—such a scream as could come from no being born of earth, or wholly of earth.      Armitage, hastening into some clothing and rushing across the street and lawn to the college buildings, saw that others were ahead of him; and heard the echoes of a burglar-alarm still shrilling from the library. An open window shewed black and gaping in the moonlight. What had come had indeed completed its entrance; for the barking and the screaming, now fast fading into a mixed low growling and moaning, proceeded unmistakably from within. Some instinct warned Armitage that what was taking place was not a thing for unfortified eyes to see, so he brushed back the crowd with authority as he unlocked the vestibule door. Among the others he saw Professor Warren Rice and Dr. Francis Morgan, men to whom he had told some of his conjectures and misgivings; and these two he motioned to accompany him inside. The inward sounds, except for a watchful, droning whine from the dog, had by this time quite subsided; but Armitage now perceived with a sudden start that a loud chorus of whippoorwills among the shrubbery had commenced a damnably rhythmical piping, as if in unison with the last breaths of a dying man.      The building was full of a frightful stench which Dr. Armitage knew too well, and the three men rushed across the hall to the small genealogical reading-room whence the low whining came. For a second nobody dared to turn on the light, then Armitage summoned up his courage and snapped the switch. One of the three—it is not certain which—shrieked aloud at what sprawled before them among disordered tables and overturned chairs. Professor Rice declares that he wholly lost consciousness for an instant, though he did not stumble or fall.      The thing that lay half-bent on its side in a foetid pool of greenish-yellow ichor and tarry stickiness was almost nine feet tall, and the dog had torn off all the clothing and some of the skin. It was not quite dead, but twitched silently and spasmodically while its chest heaved in monstrous unison with the mad piping of the expectant whippoorwills outside. Bits of shoe-leather and fragments of apparel were scattered about the room, and just inside the window an empty canvas sack lay where it had evidently been thrown. Near the central desk a revolver had fallen, a dented but undischarged cartridge later explaining why it had not been fired. The thing itself, however, crowded out all other images at the time. It would be trite and not wholly accurate to say that no human pen could describe it, but one may properly say that it could not be vividly visualised by anyone whose ideas of aspect and contour are too closely bound up with the common life-forms of this planet and of the three known dimensions. It was partly human, beyond a doubt, with very man-like hands and head, and the goatish, chinless face had the stamp of the Whateleys upon it. But the torso and lower parts of the body were teratologically fabulous, so that only generous clothing could ever have enabled it to walk on earth unchallenged or uneradicated.      Above the waist it was semi-anthropomorphic; though its chest, where the dog’s rending paws still rested watchfully, had the leathery, reticulated hide of a crocodile or alligator. The back was piebald with yellow and black, and dimly suggested the squamous covering of certain snakes. Below the waist, though, it was the worst; for here all human resemblance left off and sheer phantasy began. The skin was thickly covered with coarse black fur, and from the abdomen a score of long greenish-grey tentacles with red sucking mouths protruded limply. Their arrangement was odd, and seemed to follow the symmetries of some cosmic geometry unknown to earth or the solar system. On each of the hips, deep set in a kind of pinkish, ciliated orbit, was what seemed to be a rudimentary eye; whilst in lieu of a tail there depended a kind of trunk or feeler with purple annular markings, and with many evidences of being an undeveloped mouth or throat. The limbs, save for their black fur, roughly resembled the hind legs of prehistoric earth’s giant saurians; and terminated in ridgy-veined pads that were neither hooves nor claws. When the thing breathed, its tail and tentacles rhythmically changed colour, as if from some circulatory cause normal to the non-human side of its ancestry. In the tentacles this was observable as a deepening of the greenish tinge, whilst in the tail it was manifest as a yellowish appearance which alternated with a sickly greyish-white in the spaces between the purple rings. Of genuine blood there was none; only the foetid greenish-yellow ichor which trickled along the painted floor beyond the radius of the stickiness, and left a curious discolouration behind it.      As the presence of the three men seemed to rouse the dying thing, it began to mumble without turning or raising its head. Dr. Armitage made no written record of its mouthings, but asserts confidently that nothing in English was uttered. At first the syllables defied all correlation with any speech of earth, but toward the last there came some disjointed fragments evidently taken from the Necronomicon, that monstrous blasphemy in quest of which the thing had perished. These fragments, as Armitage recalls them, ran something like “N’gai, n’gha’ghaa, bugg-shoggog, y’hah; Yog-Sothoth, Yog-Sothoth. . . .” They trailed off into nothingness as the whippoorwills shrieked in rhythmical crescendoes of unholy anticipation.      Then came a halt in the gasping, and the dog raised its head in a long, lugubrious howl. A change came over the yellow, goatish face of the prostrate thing, and the great black eyes fell in appallingly. Outside the window the shrilling of the whippoorwills had suddenly ceased, and above the murmurs of the gathering crowd there came the sound of a panic-struck whirring and fluttering. Against the moon vast clouds of feathery watchers rose and raced from sight, frantic at that which they had sought for prey.      All at once the dog started up abruptly, gave a frightened bark, and leaped nervously out of the window by which it had entered. A cry rose from the crowd, and Dr. Armitage shouted to the men outside that no one must be admitted till the police or medical examiner came. He was thankful that the windows were just too high to permit of peering in, and drew the dark curtains carefully down over each one. By this time two policemen had arrived; and Dr. Morgan, meeting them in the vestibule, was urging them for their own sakes to postpone entrance to the stench-filled reading-room till the examiner came and the prostrate thing could be covered up.      Meanwhile frightful changes were taking place on the floor. One need not describe the kind and rate of shrinkage and disintegration that occurred before the eyes of Dr. Armitage and Professor Rice; but it is permissible to say that, aside from the external appearance of face and hands, the really human element in Wilbur Whateley must have been very small. When the medical examiner came, there was only a sticky whitish mass on the painted boards, and the monstrous odour had nearly disappeared. Apparently Whateley had had no skull or bony skeleton; at least, in any true or stable sense. He had taken somewhat after his unknown father."]}

Journeymen who are just passing through Leight, and rooming at the Inn as a matter of convenience, will see nothing amiss. There are a few splintering floorboards here, and a couple of sagging roof beams there, but these things are only natural for a lodging house thats stood for more than two centuries. I, however, with my wary eyes and cautious steps, notice more ominous flaws: the dry rot in the walls, for instance, and the stairs that are almost murderously steep. How on Earth does Monsieur Thènard keep the Inn open despite its decay and stale air? Perhaps he himself has had a part in spreading rumors about it, challenging brave visitors to spend the entire night in a haunted hotel.Then again, maybe it all boils down to the Inn being the most immediate place for a nights slumber. When one is tired and hungry, weary from sitting in a carriage or on horseback, then why not stay here?\"Good evening, Mademoiselle Dawson,\" announces an oily voice. \"Welcome to the Dreamers Inn.\"My spine stiffens. If this place is a tomb, then Monsieur Thènard is the shifty undertaker whod give you your six feet of earth once you had passed, then dig you up if your relatives couldnt pay the maintenance fees. His smile resembles a scythes blade: the one that Death wields, and with which he harvests you.\"Good evening to you too, Monsieur Thènard,\" I tell him as civilly as I can. \"Id like to rent a room, please.\"\"Certainly.\" He pauses. \"I am surprised to see you here. Can you not stay at your fathers house for free?\"\"Of course, but I have my reasons. If you must know, Im on an errand to quell all the rumors about this hotel. You and I could both stand to have more revenue coming from it, after all. What better way to do that than to put vicious village talk to rest? You know what the people say: its haunted, and not by your ordinary ghosts. They also claim that certain people, once they lie down to sleep here, never awaken. Pah! If someone wakes up dead, pardon the silly expression, then their heart failed during the night, or they perished from some other natural cause. No devilry is here, and Im out to prove it once and for all.\"\"Mais oui,\" he says, grinning. \"We two know that, but how are you going to convince the rest of Leight?\"\"I intend to spend three consecutive nights here, not just one, and come out none the worse for wear. I know that the people here typically dont listen to a godless spinster. However, if I tell them that theres nothing to fear at the Dreamers Inn - save a few usual nightmares from sleeping in a strange place - perhaps they will take heed, and tell their traveling friends and relatives to pay this establishment a visit.\"\"A splendid plan,\" Thènard replies. \"I hope it works, and here is the cost of three nights lodging.\" When he reveals it, I wince. Its not exorbitant, meaning that I can still afford it, but barely. With Theodora receiving her months wages yesterday, plus my paying an ample bill of goods from the grocer, Ill be spent out by the end of my stay.

{"id": "EN090", "pair": ["The world we live in is not as it seems. I, James White, write this document so that others may be made aware of what I have experienced and know of the dangers that lurk beneath our limited perception of \"reality\". Whether you believe me or not, dear reader, is up to you. I only ask that you read what I write with an open mind since I write, not for my own gain, but to warn you of what I can only describe as \"pure evil\".I had never heard of the \"Cult of Cthulhu\" before I began university in the late summer of 2012. I was only eighteen years old, an atheist, and dogmatically pursued scientific understanding and knowledge. At that time, I was not in the least bit interested in weird cults and other religious movements, which I simply dismissed as primitive superstition. Had I but known what I would encounter, I would have burnt the science textbook, prayed to God for the strength not to crumble into insanity and got as far away from that university as I could!The strange happenings started less than two months into my first term. I had been put into student accommodation and shared a corridor with four other boys and two girls. I had got to know my flatmates very well until all of a sudden, one of the boys by the name of Jonathan Mears disappeared. This wasnt looked upon as weird at first since Jonathan was the quiet type anyway and often spent long hours alone in his room. The suspicions arose however, when he hadnt shown his face for three days. His absence was brought up one evening as we sat in a communal area.\"Hes probably just been very busy lately,\" my best friend, Jacob Shields, said. \"You know Jonathan. When he sets his mind on something, he doesnt stop until hes achieved whatever hes trying to do.\"\"Isnt it a bit strange though?\" Annie Roberts, a lovely blonde girl from the room directly across the corridor asked. \"I mean, hes in our corridor and we havent seen him for ages. Not even in the kitchen or lecture halls.\"\"It isnt like him to miss a lecture,\" I agreed. Jacob merely waved these concerns away.\"If we havent seen him by tomorrow evening, well go to the reception and see whats happening,\" he said cheerfully.But Jonathan didnt show up the following day and, as planned, my entire corridor went to the reception desk to ask if anything had happened to him. The receptionist, an elderly lady, checked through the files on a computer before looking up at us.\"Im afraid he has left the university,\" she informed us. \"He dropped out four days ago.\"\"Well there you go!\" Jacob exclaimed. \"Nothing to worry about!\"But there was something to worry about. Even though I now had every reason to think that Jonathan was fine, I couldnt shake that feeling of foreboding. He had seemed happy in university and was consistently getting high marks so I resolved to check things out for myself.I waited until 3:00 the following morning, and in the darkness, I tiptoed along the corridor to Jonathans room. Using a paperclip, I carefully picked the lock on his door and let myself in. I closed the door behind me and switched on the light. The sight that greeted me came as a huge shock. Clothes still lay on the floor, the bed was made, books were still on the shelves and a laptop was still humming gently on the cluttered desk. In short, it looked as though Jonathan was simply out of the room. If he had gone home, why did he leave all his things behind? And if he hadnt, where was he and why did the university records state that he had? Deeply concerned, I left the room and returned to my own. I lay awake in the darkness pondering the thoughts in my head and finally decided that I needed to find out what had happened and that I would do so alone...", "May 19th, 1929,Miskatonic University, Arkham, Mass.In all honesty, the manner which Robert Olmstead exited the Chancellors office was not the most graceful to be seen in the history of Miskatonic University. However, perhaps \"exited\" is too neutral a term for a man being forcibly escorted out the double doors by two University proctors with a firm grasp on his forearms. \"Ejected\" is probably a good description though \"assaulted\" would have a good chance of being upheld by a court. As Mr. Olmstead was finally shoved out into the hall, he finally lost his balance and fell to his knees, the voluminous robes which he had worn since his arrival seeming to weigh him down.As Hiriam Willows and Brian Fife rushed out of the office and hastened to Roberts side, the man himself seemed... tired, drained of energy and showing signs of a fatigue that had been present since the meeting had began. Still, Mr. Olmstead managed to raise his head to address Chancellor Douglas Gooding, who was still in his office. \"I take it... negotiations have ended.\" Robert said this in as controlled a way as possible, trying to ignore the irritation at the back of his throat and the sides of his neck.\"Negotiations, as you call them, never began.\" Chancellor Gooding, a patrician of a man at the age of 57, had risen from behind his desk and was now walking toward the spot where Mr. Olmstead has stood and presented his case. \"This College has been handed a chance to claim credit for discovering the root devices behind most, if not all, of vertebrate biology and promises to make careers for many of our staff and students. Unless the Navy, who has graciously allowed access to its prisoners for this purpose, decides to either withdraw that access or, as you suggest, release them back into the general population, I see no reason why they should not remain under our supervision in their current quarters.\" Gooding eyes fell upon the floor where Robert had stood... and the staff that now lay on the floor. It was a strange thing: the matter itself almost resembled gray, petrified wood but in places its form showed characteristics of crustacean carapace or of the strange shapes present in fishbone or shark-jaw and, when the light hit it just so, the surface displayed a luster more akin to Nautilus shell or Mother of Pearl than any of those things.Gooding, in a sudden fit of antiquarian fascination, began kneeling down to take the strange rod. \"However, if you could tell us about this staff...\" Just as his the tips of his fingers brushed against the smooth surface the staff, seemingly under its own power, jerked butt-first towards the door, skidding over the floors polished hardwood planks. When it reached Robert. who was now being helped to his feet by Professor Fife, the staff actually began tipping up on its butt, the shaft guiding itself into Roberts limp, open hand.Grasping the staff to regain his posture, Robert glanced once more at Gooding. \"The staff is a secret that keeps itself. As to my plea... if that is your decision, I pray that you do not live to reap the whirlwind.\"\"Is that a threat?\" Chancellor Gooding was losing patience rapidly after this manifestation of the strange had made an intrusion into his office and annoyance was threatening to turn to anger.\"Merely a warning, good Chancellor.\" These were the last words that Robert Olmstead spoke to Gooding as Fife, carrying the papers that Olmstead had presented, helped him as he unsteadily walked down the hallway, supported by his implement.Just as Hiriam Willows was about to follow the pair, Gooding called to him. \"Hiriam! Get back in this office!\" Willows, his eyes continuing to follow his two companions down the hall for a moment, turned and walked back into the Chancellors office with a tightening of the lips and the speed of a slow stroll, more amenable to his aging legs than the fast walk he had so recently exerted himself with. \"Im surprised, Douglas.\"\"Surprised that I called you back in here?\" Asked Gooding as he sat back down behind his desk.\"That we are apparently operating on a first name basis now. As I recall, that has not been our habit since nineteen hundred and... seven, was it?\" It may have been facetious (to say the least) in bringing this up but after today, last winter and, to be honest, most days since Gooding had restricted Willows to a single morning class per week, he and the Chancellor has not quite been on the best of terms.\"Ah yes, the Cuba business. However... actually, that ispart of why I called you in here.\" Gooding pointed an almost accusatory finger at the older man. \"As I recall, youwere the one to countermand my decision to use force against those two Voodoo cults in Las Tunas.\"\"First of all, they were Santeria practitioners. Second, I was able to forge an armistice between the two warring factions and convince them to give up their murderous ways...\"\"In favor of continued use of animal sacrifice, I remember, I remember.\" Gooding put that accusatory finger to his temple as if to calm a throbbing. Then that finger returned to the standing faculty member. \"But whether youre French or Spanish does not mean much of anything when youre trying to rip open a portal to the tenth dimension, summoning dangerous ichors and vapors from beyond and, may I remind you, trying to violently murderas many people as needed for their insane goals. Hiriam... I know that youre a Quaker, I knowthat negotiating between groups of violent, degenerate heathens has always been your strong point, but this is something radicallydifferent.\"The Chancellor noticed Willows disbelieving roll of the eyes but continued. \"These... things have been present in and off the coast of Essex Country for the better part of a century. Theyve killed people, they subverted local government, through their negligence the port of Innsmouth nearly crumbled due to neglect... not to mention that theyve potentially forced themselves on local residents due to the existence of apparently hybrid individuals!\" He motioned out the door and pointed in the direction that Olmstead and Fife had exited. \"Did you happen to take a good look at the person who was just ejected from this office? My God Hiriam, the man was practically turning into a herring before our very eyes!\" Gooding seemed to calm down a bit. \"I know you were always one to try to see both sides of the argument, to resolve conflicts through calm deliberation... but this wasntnegotiation. This was a demand backed by veiled threats. I remember you being much sterner in the face of demands than this.\" There was a thoughtful pause. \"What happened in Virginia, Hiriam? Ever since you got back, youve been at your usual quest for cooperation between man and eldritch forces except... moreso.\"A hundred images flashed in Willows mind of that December in the Luray Valley. The little clusters of field-stone houses and barns around the southern tip of Mt. Ida; the lean-faced Quaker farm-folk; the walk through the community cemetery and the graves of his mothers family, the Caulfields. The children, so desperate to experience a properly Victorian Christmas in pageantry unknown by the community, inviting him to a snowball fight and following his lead in decorating and games (which he had found invigorating at the time). The experience of being around others of his faith for the first time in decades.But there was also the first time he had ever been forced to kill, as a .45 caliber ACP round hit dead center on his war-painted assailant in the mountain forests. The moment when he had discovered the small shrine beneath the Longhouse Meeting Hall with its black deer hides, Eastern Elk antlers and strange mix of artifacts. The sight of his hosts sacrificing pigs, wailing and dancing in the manner of the Seneca Iroquois at an isolated stone circle south along the mountains from the Armys battle with their foes, mourning for all the dead who would be brought out. And two of the bodies brought back, an apparent pair of adult twin sisters in matching warpaint who had charged the federal troops with knives before being mowed down: their hands had been intertwined even as fire from Thompson submachineguns had demolished their ribcages, the agony of their situation apparent from their found journals... the swelling around their eyes under the paint indicative of weeping.Hiriam shrugged as if he experienced nothing. \"Just a bit of reconnection with my mothers side of the family. Now, if you will excuse me?\" Before Gooding could even respond, Hiriam Willows walked out of the office and closed the doors behind him, exhaling in relief before he continued on to Professor Fifes office.Shortly, Professor Fifes OfficeBrian Fife sighed in frustration and concern as he dabbed the side of Robert Olmsteads neck with a handkerchief soaked in ice water. \"When was the last time you bothered to moisten the reservoir layers in this cloak? Any longer without adequate water around the gills and you would have been coughing up blood.\"Robert, sitting in a chair across from Fife, was now much less weary now that relief was being applied. \" There was no time. I had to act quickly to try to get them released and the last two days have been a flurry.\"\"Well, its just as well that I keep ice and water in my study or you would have...\" Fife was interrupted by Hiriam Willows entry into the office who, upon entering, simply asked himself how a militant like Douglas Gooding had become chancellor. Fifes answer to this question was concise. \"Well, Masterson died of Diphtheria while in Shanghai, Harvey has his Cocaine habit, Peaslee isnt totally trusted after that Yith business and yourefused to take any oath of office acceptable to the Congregationalist clergy. Gooding was the only member of the senior faculty with the necessary respectability left.\" \"Thank you very much. Now, what do we do next?\" Hiriam sat down in another chair, forming a semicircular huddle as he addressed Olmstead. \"Gooding isnt going to budge an inch without a proper prodding, the Arkham Police are beginning to take note of your lodgings at the Miskatonic Hotel and your current appearance which, may I remark, is becoming more piscine by the day, will not inspire confidence in the other involved parties.\"\"Then we have to properly prod. I have to prod. I owe that much at least.\" Robert, now that his neck and gills were properly wetted (and the kelp layers under his robe properly inundated with cold water), became quiet, both hands still across his lap, grasping the staff he had carried since he had arrived.Fife knew what he was thinking, for it was also close to his heart. \"Robert, you dont have to do this. The Priests of Yha-Nthlei wont judge you harshly if you dont bring home any more of our people than your cousin; I know its tragic, but its happened before that people have been lost to the surface world.\"Robert suddenly got a hard look in his eyes and stared directly at the other man. \"Do you know what it feels like to lose your parents, your child, your neighbors or friends? To not know where they were taken? To fear for their lives while they might be undergoing hideous, nefarious tortures? And then, one day, you are suddenly confronted with the grinning idiot who, in his disgust and primordial fear, ensured your loved ones capture and now, while you are forced to hide like a crab in the sand, are expected to welcome this fool into your ranks?\"He groaned at the memory... or even more than the memory. \"The punishment for my loutish treachery was harsh, but even a flayed back will not absolve all I have done, all I have seen. My flogging will not return parents to children or husbands to wives. My pain will not sooth the fear of mothers for their sons. And the welts upon my back will not make me forget the accusation, the pain... the sorrowin their eyes. I am doing this as much for myself as for them; doing it so that I wont have to live with my failures for an eternity.\" Willows and Fife were quiet until Fife quietly asked \"So, what now?\"\"If I cant do anything, the warriors will be swimming upstream in less than a week. When they get here... I cant promise that anyone will be safe.\" Robert looked pensive, a calculating look on his face. \"We... Iwill have to make an impression in front of Gooding. Somewhere public, somewhere will it will make an impression that cant be dismissed or ignored. Anything come to mind?\"It was then that it struck Hiriam. \"Of course, the regatta tomorrow! Gooding will be attendance, he hasto be in attendance according to College statutes. But what are you going to do?\"Having been asked, Robert began to think. \"I assume itll be on the Miskatonic?\"\"Where else? Hangmans Brook has never been deep enough for rowing and the University never affluent enough to construct a canal.\" Fife explained.\"Will there be many other people there?\" Robert asked again, something beginning to form in his already-changed brain.\"Everyone who can: students, alumni, dock workers, beggars... why do you ask?\" Hiriam was now curious as to this whole thing.Robert looked down at the staff in his hands, feeling the smooth surface but also feeling the power coursing through the object. The Staff of Dagon... said to have been wielded by their king and blessed by the mighty Priest to whom Dagon and Hydra had sworn loyalty. Once, it had been said to have performed wonders.Once... and perhaps again."]}
{"id": "EN042", "pair": ["In 2050 an ill-conceived invasion of earth was launched by the Kalkars, a human-like, if excessively tall, race from a world called Va-Nah. They were led by a petty dictator called Orthis. It was spectacularly unspectacular, just another failed attempt to subjugate pre-cataclysmic humanity. However, it is notable for the reason that they had brought with them one thousand Va-gas, a lavender-hued slave race of quadrupeds with human-like faces and front limbs that doubled as arms. Not particularly intelligent at this stage of their development, the Va-gas were violent and cannibalistic, (Due in part to a lack of available food on Va-Nah) even preferring Va-gas flesh over that of other races. Fierce fighters with great strength, they also bred rapidly, making them very useful to their masters, since, as well as serving as soldiers, they also served as food for their brutal masters. The Kalkars, though arguably more intelligent than the Va-gas, were even worse. They (The Kalkars) grew fat, lazy and complacent, still, for over 200 years they managed to rule earth, mainly through dumb luck and petty cruelty. Unlike H.G. Wells luckless Martian invaders in War of the Worlds, the Kalkars could survive (And breed) quite well in earths atmosphere.Torren-Wraeth played no part in the earth-Va-Nah war, Goro had died in 2042 and the youth was lost in his own private agonies and recriminations. The Great Old Ones and Outer Gods mostly stood by on the sidelines, it did not concern them whether earth was ruled by humans or Kalkars, in the end, earth belonged to them. They felt the Va-gas had potential as servants, but the Kalkars were fairly useless to them. So the war was fought, mortal against mortal, bloody and cruel as all wars are. Orthis died early in the war, but it was a costly victory, for the human leader had perished with him. For every human victory, there was a terrible loss, Mankind was thrust into loose fifedoms and petty kingdoms in what the scholars call, The Second Dark Age, and the Kalkars Empire reigned supreme. But, as with all empires, they faltered... The conquerers degenerated, forgetting the technology of their ancestors. Eventually humanity rose up and all but wiped them out with little more than swords and knives. Inter-species breeding and The Great Arising had, apparently, finished the job.The Va-gas, being even less human-like and therefore more easily despised, were nearly wiped out as well, but they had won the favor of various powerful entities who rescued and found uses for them, particularly Shub-Niggurath. Torren-Wraeth had protected a small tribe of Va-gas as well, leaving them to protect his personal sanctuary, an abandoned shrine to Tsathoggua in Canada. It was here that he kept his most valued possessions and important artifacts. Many of Goros belongings were housed within the temple, as were priceless treasures rescued from oblivion during the Great Arising. Paintings, statues, books... The history of humanity protected by descendants of alien invaders within a temple to an alien god. The Toad God himself allowed the use of his sanctuary for this purpose, as he was both Torren-Wraeths great-uncle and too lazy and indifferent to truly care.The Va-gas had become more intelligent over the centuries, and those associated with Torren-Wraeth were far less vicious than their ancestors. They even lived in a sort of uneasy peace with the nearby human tribes, by human terms, they had been civilized. Once again, Torren-Wraeth wondered if it was right to impose human standards on non-human beings: Werent they better off, not killing and eating each other? Werent the local humans safer now? Hadnt he helped them? Isnt that what the colonialists he so hated always said? It was too late to wonder about that now...Torren-Wraeth had visited Va-Nah once, and only once, it was worse than RLyeh, worse than Tond, even. Even in its current state, earth was a far better place to live than that wretched hell-hole.Torren-Wraeth glided over the burgeoning town of New Yokohama, set up by Japanese refugees hed managed to ferry safely to Canada. It was named after Goros hometown, though few knew of Torren-Wraeths prior dealings with Japan, the Emperor and Shoguns had hushed everything up. Great Cthulhu, through Torren-Wraeth, had offered to make the Japanese Empire the greatest in the world, but they had refused. They could not accept one of the terms of the agreement, they could never bear the dishonor of mixing their blood with Gyo-Jin. They had no idea that some of their people were already involved with the Gyo-Jin, as were people in coastal areas all over the world...and Torren-Wraeth had not enlightened them. People looked up and waved, Torren-Wraeth was well-liked in New Yokohama, as he had saved the original founders from certain death.The Va-gas settlement, Black-Stone-Place, was primitive, huts of wood and stone arraigned in a semi-circle around the black stone temple. Va-gas usually dwelled in Tepee-like structures, but these were settled, as guardians of the temple, they naturally remained in its vicinity. They even had a rude form of agriculture, though this was mainly for animal feed, as Va-gas vastly preferred meat over vegetables. They raised some pigs and horses for convenient food, but they were mainly hunters, deer, wild hogs, wild horses, and moose were abundant. They, like most Va-gas on earth, worshiped The Black Goat of The Woods With A Thousand Young, and a shrine of antlers and bone lay at the apex of the crescent shaped village. It was here that the Goats Dark Young came to collect their sacrifices and accept their worship, for the Dark Young were Shub-Nigguraths proxies, as Torren-Wraeth was Cthulhus.The Va-gas chieftain, Walks-With-The-Wind, met Torren-Wraeth as he landed. He stood upright on his hind limbs, and extended a three-digited paw in greeting. \"Welcome back. May The Mother of All bless you.\" His black hair was beginning to gray, but his grip was strong. \"And may she bless you, my friend.\" Torren-Wraeth replied, \"Hows hunting?\" A small crowd of Va-gas of various sizes and ages gathered around the Half-Spawn, \"The Mother has granted us abundance.\" \"Im glad to hear it. Any problems with the humans?\" Walks-With-The-Wind paused thoughtfully, \"No, humans rarely come, and none enter the temple.\" \"The guardian must be lonely.\" Of course, the guardian was never lonely, even if it did not have twelve heads to keep itself company, it lacked such mortal attributes as loneliness and boredom, but it possessed the key that made it an invaluable guardian, loyalty. At the mention of the guardian, the Va-gas drew back as one, they feared it, that terrible spirit with twelve heads on long, scraggly necks and twenty legs on its globular body. It had not been his intention to frighten the superstitious Va-gas, but he had. \"Im going to visit the temple. Thank you for guarding it so well.\" Torren-Wraeth smiled, and made his way through the parting creatures. They wouldnt set foot in the temple, they believed it to be filled with captive human souls from the Great Arising, despite Torren-Wraeths assertions to the contrary.The temple was of black stone, squat and rectangular, with massive stone doors.Torren-Wraeth entered the temple.", "Rodrigo: (Laughing) \"Horror? You speak to me of horror? I have seen things which would make the gods tremble!\"Massa di Requiem per ShuggayAct II Scene IVBenevento Chieti Bordighera(Translated from the original Italian)Torren-Wraeth hated being summoned. He hated human sacrifice even more. After all, his mother had been human, but he could not act against his fathers wishes, nor those who had summoned him, at least, not directly. He was here merely to witness, to stand helpless as a life was taken.The youth stood, tall and handsome, his striking Polynesian features offset by his green skin and six slender tendrils that lined his chin and jaw. He was in a house, surrounded by black-robed humans, cult artifacts and blazing braziers. A young man lay upon a stone table, bound, screaming. Torren-Wraeth walked over to the table, regret in his glistening yellow eyes, \"Im so sorry.\" The mans bulging eyes stared past him, followed two of the cultists as they moved toward a spot near the west wall of the basement/temple, strained with terror.The worshipers began to chant, and one among them called out in a loud voice, \"For the glory of Great Cthulhu, we offer this one to The Beast Below!\"\"My father does not need sacrifices...\" Torren-Wraeth said loudly. That was true, to a point. His father did not, in fact, need sacrifices, but he did desire them. Perhaps, he could save this one... But they ignored him. He watched as the men rolled back a large stone, revealing a dark hole beneath. Ghouls? Ghouls can be reasoned with, better than some humans... He frowned, spoke louder \"I said, my father...\"Then it hit him. A noxious smell poured forth through the opening, gagging him. It was not the familiar, moldy corpse smell of ghouls, but something bizarre, like ammonia and drying blood... And there was something else, something far, far worse. Voices. Many voices. Laughing madly, weeping, screaming. Screaming such as Torren-Wraeth had never heard in his life; the horrific, hopeless shrieking of the damned.He unconsciously backed away as a huge form slithered slowly from the deepest region of the pit. Torren-Wraeth nearly vomited at the sight. It was similar in shape to a worm, blood-colored and slimy, but that was not the true horror of the thing, it was its faces... A grinning, evil human face peered from the anterior of the beast, but dozens of other anguished, maddened human faces protruded at random from its hideous form. Their eyes reflected unspeakable torment, madness, and a longing for the release of death. Some babbled or laughed senselessly, others begged for death or wept, or just screamed... So many faces, so much unholy suffering. It turned toward the sacrificial table and its occupant.At the sight the victim screamed in utter terror, but his voice was drowned out by the many voices of the thing. Torren-Wraeth had heard of such things, but had not believed, had hoped that they did not exist.The Chakota.An abomination which absorbed its victims, body and mind, leaving its unfortunate prey trapped within its hateful body, aware but helpless. The first head, the mind of the beast, was the cultist who had willingly created it, literally became the beast, the others the miserable wretches it had absorbed over the years.Torren-Wraeths body turned pale yellow with horror. He had seen so much evil and cruelty in his life, but this, this was vile beyond all reason. The Binding broke with his terror. He was free to act.His reaction was instinctive, human.He screamed, grabbed the nearest brazier, and struck at the beast with it.The Chakota itself screamed as the coals and flames struck its slimy flesh, and it was alight. Torren-Wraeth struck at it again and again, scattering flaming coal across the room, igniting tapestries and furnishings. More braziers were knocked over by the beasts own struggles and the cultists scrambling for the stairs. The stone floor grew hot, and the walls caught fire. The Chakota turned to flee toward its hole, towards cool, dark safety, but Torren-Wraeth drove the broken brazier through it like a stake, pinning it in place. There was no escape.The flames danced across the stones.As the fire raged around him, Torren-Wraeth turned to the sacrificial victim, intending to free him, but a quick glance revealed that the man was dead, his face contorted in terror. He had died of fear.In some ways, he was lucky. He wondered how many of the cultists had died in the fire, and had the brief, dark feeling that they deserved it. He pushed it from his mind.He turned his attention back to the Chakota.The beast writhed in agony. The screams grew louder, shriller, while, from some of the faces trapped within the beast, came shouts of joy and thanksgiving. Facing the flames was preferable to living within the beast...Though it was obscured by smoke and flames, Torren-Wraeth watched as the Chakota quickly shriveled and blackened, withered like a worm on a hot sidewalk.Then, there were only ashes.The fire was spreading too quickly, the heat was intense, he had to leave or risk injury himself. Torren-Wraeth teleported away, leaving the cleansing fire to its work.He returned home. Not RLyeh, but Rapa Nui, which the white men called Easter Island.He threw up, then wept...Later,Torren-Wraeth stood within an ancient quarry, partially carved Moai bearing mute witness to his words. \"No more! No more human sacrifices!\" He shouted at the top of his lungs. He didnt care about the consequences. He had ignored his conscience, his honor for too long.\"You go where you are summoned!\" Great Cthulhus telepathic voice, calling out from his body in RLyeh, registered rage at this defiance.\"Never again!\" Torren-Wraeths voice was firm. He was ashamed that he had ever been party to such a thing, and he refused to do so again. His skin was blotched with conflicting emotion, \"You dont even need sacrifices, much less intelligent ones! I wont help you commit murder, not anymore!\"\"Who are you to judge me!?\"Torren-Wraeth fell silent.Great Cthulhu sighed, his child was becoming sentimental, rebellious. It was his mothers blood, it could not be helped. Ever since he had befriended that human, he had become more like them... Still, it was a small thing. \"Very well, Torren-Wraeth, from now on you will never represent me at a sentient sacrifice again.\"The boy knelt quickly, \"Thank you, father...\"\"Do not thank me yet, I may ask something of you in return.\"And Torren-Wraeth knew without a doubt that he would."]}
{"id": "EN027", "pair": ["An autumnal chill descended upon the streets of Glaston as the young man walked upon the concrete sidewalk, passing redbrick storefronts and shop windows, every surface still wet with the morning rain. Leaves, red and orange and each vibrant in their hue, were shaken loose from the trees lining the street by the wind, landing wherever they fell. For an instant in time, the spectacle of the leaves drew the attention of the man, in fact little more than a teenage boy, as he made his way toward the corner. However, Joseph Clayton, clad in bluejeans and jacket with a backpack slung from his shoulders, had far more important things to focus on than a show of falling leaves. An important test for this semester was arriving in a week or so and he needed to study.Also, he was getting quite hungry this close to lunch.As Joseph rounded the corner and continued toward his favorite eatery, he wondered if he would get swamped in the usual lunch crowd. However, as he saw the front of the Leng Trinh Restaurant, his thoughts turned to quiet dejection.\"Damnit!\" muttered Joseph as he approached the eatery. The reason for this turn in mood was the carpet of tempered glass fragments on the sidewalk below the picture window at the front of the establishment, which was now covered by plastic sheeting. Thuch Van Trinh, one half of the husband-and-wife ownership, was wearing a plaid jacket over his apron and usual cooking clothes and was shoveling the broken glass into a bucket. \"Hey, Mr. Trinh, hows it going?\". Joseph asked with a smile. This was more false cheer than anything, as Joseph could guess how Thuch must be feeling: anger was always a popular choice, followed closely by worry about the reason why.Despite what he must have been feeling, Thuch Van Trinh grinned back, the black lines of his facial tattooing creasing as the muscles moved under his cheeks. \"Not so good, Mr. Clayton. If this keeps up, I may have to put in Plexiglas so that the window wont break.\" The Trinhs accents, as his parents and the other adults of the town told it, had been rather strong (even unusually so) when they had immigrated to Glaston from their first home in Boston. This had usually been waved off by their purported origins in the remote hills on the Vietnam-Laos border, seemingly collaborated by how their teeth had been dyed black. On the other hand, given their rural roots, their speed in adapting local speech patterns so that they now sounded more like second generation Americans (and especially their daughters complete lack of any accent except the local standard) did make for a puzzling situation. However, for their ease of assimilation and the food they served, they had become well-liked in the community.So why were things like this happening to them recently? \"How many times does this make this month; two, three?\" Joseph had to ask this, wondering if things were worse than he thought.\"Its happened three times already, this time not more than an hour ago. Thanh wants to install security cameras to watch the place and with how small and cheap they are now, I think we just might.\" An hour ago? Theyd smashed a picture window in broad daylight? Who in town could be that stupid or that angry? Josephs train of thought was broken then, when Thuch said something of much more interest to the younger man. \"By the way, if youre looking for Marie, shes helping her mother in the kitchen. Even without a window we seem to be doing good business.\" Thuch went back to his work and Joseph, not wanting to delay any longer, entered the restaurant.Just as Thuch had said, Leng Trinh still had its usual busy lunchtime crowd, albeit one that was concentrated near the back wall. Picking his way around tables packed with diners, Joseph finally arrived at a table set for two, a reserved sign upon it. Removing his backpack and laying it beside a chair, he sat down, shuffled off his coat and went to bury his nose in the menu.It always felt a bit odd to Joseph, eating in an ethnic restaurant where none of the diners were the same ethnicity as the cooks, or even from the same part of the world. However, none of it mattered when the food was as good as it was here.\"Now then, what would a fine, upstanding New England boy like yourself want in a place like this?\" The voice that asked this was soft, amused, female and had an almost mocking tone. It also had the accent of the New England uplands. To Joseph, it could only be one person.\"The same thing I always get here.\" He answered dryly before looking up from the menu. There, holding a pad of paper and a pen, was teenage girl with almond-shaped eyes, shoulder length black hair with green streaks, a cooking apron and an amused grin. \"Hi Marie... you sure your moms alright with you waitressing this crowd?\"\"Weve got enough help in the kitchen already and Dads coming in after all the glass is cleaned up.\" She glanced up at the window, plastic sheet and all, after she wrote his order down. \"I just wish we knew who was doing this. If we dont get someone else to cough up some money, our insurance company might go sour on us.\" Marie went back to the kitchen to get the food for both of them.Ten minutes later, she was laying out two place settings of food that had been prepared ahead of time. \"Alright, thats two plates of grilled pork on beds of Leng-style rice, your dish of steamed green beans with soy sauce for dipping, my bowl of soup and two cans of soda.\" Theyd eat lunch before studying, with Joseph paying the tab for both of them.If anyone asked, it wasnt a date. Not in the strictest sense, anyway.\"What, no bak bon dzhow?\" Asked Joseph, decidedly disappointed at the apparent lack of the special ingredient.To this, Marie moved a small earthen bowl from the serving tray onto the table and lifted the lid to reveal a thick gray sauce containing mushrooms and cracked black pepper. \"Would I be one to deny you the gravy of the gods?\" She asked (rhetorically) with a soft smile; Joseph couldnt help but smile back as he cracked the tab on his soda and began on his green beans.A bit later, when his beans were gone and Marie had almost finished her soup, Joesph began formulating a question that related to a curious thought that had sprung up earlier. \"Not to sound like a nag or anything, but Im just curious but what was all that upstanding stuff about?\" The only time he had ever heard anyone talk like that was...Oh God...Marie swallowed the last bits of her soup. \"Oh, I dont know. Maybe Its that I had no idea that the son of insurance brokers had such deep and aristocratic roots? Maybe its that I was surprised to find out that the Claytons had come not from hardy New England farming stock as I had assumed, but from the urbane, wealthy ranks of those grand Brahmins of Boston? Im sure Granny Cora could tell some fascinating stories about the old days; she sure seemed interested in mine.\" If anything, Marie took the entire thing in stride, treating both the memory of the experience and the experience itself with a a great deal of interested amusement. Certainly, mocking the type of language she had encountered was almost cracking her up.Joseph, on the other hand, had first felt bemusement at the scene in which the Clayton family reunion of the past summer had found itself, quickly turning into outright embarrassment. \"Look, Im sorry that I didnt tell you about her, but everybody thought that she wouldnt be able to come due to health concerns. Its not my fault that a half-senile, 97 year old woman worked up enough stubbornness to drag her nurse halfway across the state!\".\"I never said anything about anyone being at fault. I just thought it was an interesting revelation about your family.\" She had meant her cajoling in good humour, but Josephs defensiveness and embarrassment were never good emotions to bring out. \"Anyway, most people would be proud to have the Boston gentry in their family history: industrialists, merchants, art, culture, philanthropy, charity...\" With every word, Marie spooned a bit of ban boc dzhow onto her grilled pork.\"As well as whaling, slave trading, opium smuggling, snobbery and having your entire life guided by the expectations of your peers; exactly the sorts of things my parents taught me to loathe. The thing is, my great-great-grandmother came from a very select, very privileged and lily-white background; I was worried that shed... well, react oddly to you.\" Joseph retorted as he began spooning (or rather, pouring) the sauce onto his meat after Marie had finished with it and passed it to him. In the case of Cora Clayton (nee Coffin), Josephs fear hadnt primarily been that she would find Marie objectionable on account of her race since that prejudice had been more ingrained in her parents generation than hers. His fear had instead been that his great great grandmother, as self-proclaimed guardian of the old, aristocratic traditions, might object to their relationship because the Trinhs were restaurateurs with no history of pedigree, education or money behind them.In Coras world (the 1920s, where her mind was half the time), heirs had married heiresses, families had coordinated their fortunes and everyone had kept an eye on everyone else; these were rules of decorum that had lasted for her long after the Claytons had gone bust in the great Crash of 29. The fact that she had taken Joseph aside and explained her concerns to him had done nothing to soothe his embarrassment, although he had finally convinced her that, being naturalized citizens with a successful restaurant, the Trinhs were firmly in the middling classes. She had also estimated that said restaurant, with no other inheritors besides Marie, would most likely pass into Clayton hands in the fullness of time.No one had dared explain to her the differences between modern teenage dating and the genteel courtships of her youth.\"I dont think she reacted that oddly. Sure, she was so out of date that you had to explain that I meant French Indochina when I said that my parents came from Vietnam and she did seem a bit too fascinated with my families origins and, alright, it was weird hearing someone actually use the word courting without trying to be funny. However, it was kind of nice to speak French with someone in this town after all the time my parents invested in me learning it.\" Marie knew that while it had been terrifying for Joseph, having to put up with his relatives dissection of his relationship and fearing disapproval, she herself had enjoyed a chance to see if the old stereotypes were true. When it had become clear to Marie that the elderly woman was not about to spew racial epitaphs at her but was, indeed, fascinated as to her families background, Marie had made it a point to ham it up in telling their story.To an entranced Cora Clayton, Marie had described her parents lives before emigration as a subsistence existence in a village high up in the fog-choked mountain passes. She had woven scenes of her people worshiping strange, heathen gods far from the civilized lands of the Buddha and partaking in ghastly rituals to ensure harvests of rice from narrow mountainside terraces. She told the old woman that her parents had tired of such a life and had dreamed of something more, something in the wider world glimpsed in third-hand magazines and radio broadcasts.After receiving a dispensation from their village shaman to leave (but promising to sent back remittances), they had made their way to Hanoi and then to Boston and finally to Glaston where, having never truly given up the more religious and symbolic aspects of their heathenish past, they nevertheless had made good names for themselves in the community. Marie had made sure that her prose had been both lurid and exotic so as to fully entrance a child of the Age of Empire as well as making proper use of tone, whether enraptured, casual or deathly serious, to emphasize mood. The end result was to make it sound as if her culture wasnt just some rural outlet of modern Vietnam or Laos, but as if it was truly unlike any other in the world.That was an opinion that Joseph was also rapidly adopting.They ate in relative silence for a while, the bustle of the lunch crowd beginning to die down as people left, many of them stopping to talk to Mr. Trinh at the till, expressing their concern over what had happened with the window. They were just about half done when Joseph began another conversation. \"So, did you know that theres a Heritage Day coming up at school in a few weeks?\"\"Yeah, and?\" Deep down in her gut, Marie was beginning to get a slightly worried feeling from the direction this conversation was going. This pretty much happened whenever the subject of her parents past came up but, like so many times before, she could probably bluff her way through it.\"I thought that, maybe, we could do something for it. I was thinking about dredging up something from Normandy because I didnt want to clog up the schedule with another variation of British regional culture.\" It sounded perfectly innocent, but Marie knew that this was a potentially tricky situation that might require misdirection, a convincing excuse and possible outright lying.She hated lying to Joseph.\"Alright then. You can do that, Ill do the Vietnamese thing and well knock em all dead.\" She answered with an enthusiasm that she hoped had betrayed nothing of her growing unease with the conversation. This seemed to provoke nothing but a non-committal murmur of agreement and thus, thinking that that was over with, she began eating again.However, that was not the end of it.\"By Vietnamese, do you mean the standard culture from around Hanoi... or the culture from your parents home village?\" Joseph asked, seemingly as if only for the purpose of clarification. There was much more behind it though, and whether it was just ingrained paranoia or any real danger of exposure, Marie knew that this was entering onto some very tenuous and potentially very dangerous ground. Still, the subject had to be breached.\"Arent they pretty much the same? I mean, sure, it was pretty rural back there, but whether village or city, we were all Viet: same language, same culture, same blood, same... pretty much everything, when you think about it.\" As denials went, this one wasnt half bad: sincere enough to be taken seriously and with enough internal logic that it wouldnt fall apart immediately in the face of the mildly educated mind.On this subject, however, Joseph had become rather more than merely mildly educated. He had observed things for a long time: a lot of little things and one or two big things for the most part. And he, after long deliberation and study, had discovered that some of those things just didnt match up.\"You know, there was a time when I could believe that. But... there are just too many deviations to discount.\" Joesph stopped eating all together, putting down his fork and looking his girlfriend straight in the eyes before closing and opening them again, as if to rally his thoughts. \"The food, for one thing, isnt like any kind of Vietnamese food Ive read about. Yes, you have the side dishes but thats about it for similarity. Second, your parents tattoos. Again, unlike any other group in Southeast Asia; the closest matches I could find were incised lines on bronze figurines from over two thousand years ago.\"He stopped again. \"And then theres the language you guys speak. Im fairly sure its in the Mon-Khmer group, but Ive been doing some research and... honestly, Ive seen words on this menu that Ive never been able to find in any other source. And Im not the only one whos noticed these things.\" Joesph saw panic flash across Maries eyes, though she tried to hide it. \"Most people dont pay attention and honestly dont care, and the ones who do notice just assume that you guys are either Hmong or some little minority that no-ones ever heard of... but even that doesnt match very well either. Its like you said, youre Viet... but what about all this other stuff?\"It was then that Marie could have ended it all: the doubts, the questions, the lingering curiosity... as well as twenty one centuries of secrecy, tradition and very likely her relationship with this young man. In the end, she decided to dodge again. \"What can I say? We were very rural.\" When Joesph just got this frustrated look on his face, Marie sighed, reached across the table and enveloped one of his hands with hers. \"Look, Ill try and dredge something up if I can, but I cant promise anything, okay?\"Joseph mulled on this lack of answers, but as the moment dragged on, his resistance wore down. \"Alright. If you dont want to talk about your culture, thats alright; lots of people come to America to get away from stuff. But I still am sorta curious.\" Then he changed the subject. \"Anyway, after we eat, we should begin studying for our tests. Do you want to go over the English or the Algebra first?\"\"We should do the Math first, then we can cool off with the Shakespeare. But we better not let the food get cold, what with how the sauce gets if allowed to sit for too long.\" Marie began eating again and, after a few beats, Joseph resumed as well.They stayed at that table for many hours, going over and revising their knowledge of maths and literature. However, already Marie wondered if there was something she could reveal, something that she could show about her parents culture that would not threaten expose them and, as the old saying went among her tribe, get them cut in half and buried in two graves.Later that night, The Trinhs upstairs apartmentTo Maries relief, her parents reaction to her plan wasnt anger. On the other hand, fear and worry could be almost as painful.\"I know how you feel about the Clayton boy. Hes well-liked, intelligent and his parents are our insurance agents.\" Thanh Thi Trinh began, speaking in her families particular dialect of Viet as she, Marie and Thuch Van sat around their dining room table. \"But I ask this of you: is Joesph and his interest in this celebration worth the risk of exposure and, may I add, possible death when this town realizes who we are, when they realize what we are?\" Thanh Thi had always been the more reserved, more cautious and, frankly, more paranoid spouse in this family when it came to their safety. Where her husband was the face of the restaurant, she ran the kitchen with an eye on the back door and all of their cooks. While Thuch made friendly at social gatherings, Thanh kept track of all possible escape routes and who was and wasnt looking at them. She kept track of any news about gangs and hate-group activity in the area, and about any other strange things.The sort of things that might lure out the kind of people who hunted their people.But Marie had prepared for this. \"Mother, I know the risks that revealing the secrets of our people would bring. However, I am counting on two circumstances to make sure that only the most benign and harmless information is portrayed.\" She rallied herself, knowing that the way she handled this could make the difference on how she presented herself to nearly everyone, especially Joseph . \"First, I must inform both of you that there are some people in this town, including my boyfriend, that realize that we are not quite from the mainstream culture of modern Vietnam.\" At this, both Thanh and Thuch got even more worried but they werent shocked, seeing as any bumpkin with an Internet connection could find that tribal tattooing wasnt really the rage in downtown Hanoi. \"The good news is that while these people realize that we belong to a distinct subgroup, they often deduce that we are either rural Hmong or some other obscure ethnic group. In other words, they know nothing about who our people are and, like the rest of the town, they honestly do not care.\"\"What about the nature of our traditons, Marie? What would you do, what rite of our people would be performed on that stage that would not end up with half the town vomiting and the other half trying to hang us?\" Her father had been relatively quiet in this conversation, but he knew that the rituals of his village had, during various times in history, left such a bad impression upon outsiders that they had responded in force to try to stamp them out.Here, Marie began grasping the thick, heavy and old scrapbook that lay closed upon the table before her. It had been entrusted to them by their village and, by the blessings of the Gods and their Instrument, they had kept it safe and hidden for more than twenty years. \"Father, it is not as if I wish to set up an alter on the stage, recite the incantations of the harvest rites and slice something open; frankly, I would have no idea how. However, I believe that there is a ritual that is benign, unusual and, even according to the author of this book, beautiful enough to make people forget its oddity.\" She opened the book, filled with sepia photographs and notes written in French on yellowed paper, to the page she had bookmarked. \"I want to do the Stork Dance.\"Her parents were quiet for a minute. Admittedly, this was probably the least unusual rite of their people and it did seem to have a calming effect on its audiences. However, it took weeks of intensive training in order to do it right, the costuming and specific actions depended on whether the dancer was a man or woman and the phonograph with the instrumental music and vocals, only having been recorded once before, was on the other side of the planet. It was a tall order to pull off for anyone. \"You do realize that practicing for the dance requires grueling routine, so much so that it might effect your school work?\" Asked her mother, wondering if her daughter was truly sincere.\"I know that. Ill just have to sacrifice my time with Joesph, a sacrifice that Im sure hed understand.\" Marie responded in English this time, the plans for her act becoming clearer. \"However, Ill need some help in creating the proper costuming and... I know that shipping items from the Old Country is like trying to smuggle Plutonium but if you could convince the shamans to release that phonograph for a month or two, I would be eternally grateful to all of them, and to you.\"Her parents wondered, not for the first time, if Marie truly comprehended what could be asked of that gratitude in the years to come. She had the opportunity to live a life completely detached from the paranoia, the fear and the constant danger that followed her people. Would she give that chance away simply for the sake of a boy?Whatever choice she made, however, was hers to make.In the end, they acquiesced... but not without informing their daughter of what their home village could ask of her in exchange for the items she wished. It might be years until it was asked but one day, a representative of their village would approach her and request a repayment, be it in money, information or something else.It was that \"something else\" that truly worried Thuch and Thanh.", "1945, 10 years after Smifts abduction. InnsmouthA man was running in a dark town. The chasers were holding torches and pitchforks. \"Go die you human scum!\" one of them growled, the young man was about to fire a pistol to this antagonistic chord when a knife reached the back of this heart. Before he could die he saw these enemies more closely, looking similar to humans, even using casual suits, but this faces were slightly distorted, with a bluish tinge and big eyes. These hands were very close to being webbed. One of them reaches the pockets of the corpses clothes, finding a diary with a logo in the middle: Miskatonic University.The next day. at Miskatonic, Massachusetts, Wilhelm Smift was very old, at the age of 68. He was in a bed resting this very frail body. He was accompanied by this young friend Johnathan Clarke. \"My dear friend, due to the fact that I will die, and I never had a family before…I will give to you the weapon that can protect humanity from the unknown. But please, pass some of my blood to you so he can perceive you as a member of my family, also you dont need to worry, my blood is not ill, I figured out that the Infinitely Timed Room makes you die of old age once you exited it, and due to the fact that my wife never could give me a child…and she is deceased, you will be my new successor\" Clarke used a syringe and injected some of the blood of this predecessor into himself. And then Wilhelm Smift died. The young would be teacher found himself sad, he knows that this mentor had told him of the physical god he mastered. But he wanted to learn more about not only physics but the alien technology as well, but he always told him that \"this mind would crack\" but how such an old fellow acquired such knowledge and remained sane? He departed to the basement, he knows that such places are only allowed to certain people, but Smift had told him that if he declared himself this son he would pass. The place was light by a single torch. To find a tall humanoid structure close to him, this shadow taller than any man he has seen. \"So my master had passed away…such a pity, I wanted to serve him more than no one.\" The voice was sly, and with a sharp tone. As this mentor said, but right now he sounded…sad? \"He was a great man, and me? Only an fucking killer…heh, its funny…how the good can die, alone and unnoticed…and they stay dead.\" he noticed John \"who we have here?\" he stared at the young man and in turn he noticed the mechanical being before him: this main body was cylindrical and red, with a single crimson cat like eye in the center of this \"head\" this arms have white with red colorations like the rest of this limbs, he had a large rectangular shield in this left arm, a set of three small red pouches and in the right a knife holder and the left a pistol holder, and a white cloth skirt. \"What is doing a brat in my home?\" he tried this best to gather mental strength and answer: \"I am the…son of Wilhelm Smift, he told me you would serve me\" the beast looked at him with this single blood colored eye, \"I can see trough you…and that is true, the Smift blood is in you kid, I mean master\" then the monster grabbed this pistol and started to show it at this server, \"so tell me, what shall I do? I am capable for killing anything\" he young man tried this best to organize this words and asks: \"why do you look different from what my father told me?\" the creature chuckles and says: \"heh, isnt it obvious? I wanted to look different cause I dont want to look like the jackasses that wanted me gone. They made this suit look like a fuckin asylum inmate . I was looking for something that suited me, so I left my dimension for one day. And I saw the perfect one, this one, why do you ask? cause I wanted a new look that minds insurrection?\" he pointed this white finger at the young man, that eye…its just like the devil itself was looking at him. \"And the eye?\" \"Oh…that was my…personal touch\" he started to laugh and this companion started to tremble. \"Dont be afraid kid…I dont bite, for much that I want to.\" Azathoth pointed at this \"face\" revealing that he doesnt have a mouth. Then he started to laugh like a maniac. He kid got out of the basement in fear. \"Hey dont get out! I was about to have tell you a great joke! MASTER!\"The next day…\"sire, we have bad news, Roy Urkam has…died\" a messenger told to this young chief, \"and who is that man, messenger?\" Clarke asks, \"He was a freelance investigator. He heard that something strange happened in Innsmouth so we sent him there, when I came this corpse was on a stick on the end of the road, when I asked they said: \"just a couple of kids that did it\" it was obvious that was a lie.\" The kid was…shocked but after scare from yesterday this was nothing. Suddenly a car was coming to the entrance, the occupants got out, they have guns and their eyes had watered eyes that were slightly out of their sockets. And they forced the main door down, \"thank god there are not students!\" the sire said, Clarke rushed to the basement and yelled the name of this protector and servant. \"INVASORS! COME AND KILL THEM! THEY HAVE GUNS!\" the young man yelled. \"Calm down master, I will go kick their skulls\" he got out of this dark lair and he readied this colt pistol and this knife. \"Come here! I can sense cowardly in this place!\" suddenly a blaze of bullets came from the outside of the campus. \"I think I need a bigger gun\" he turned this back and then a rectangular and red colored heavy machine gun was grabbed from this holster, the weapon was so tall as the cylinder body of this user and it looked different from any gun ever made: it had a slightly bended square in this top. This barrel had holes and this body was metallic instead of wood. Then he got out of the building and he saw these enemies \"Deep ones!\" they started to fire but it was useless, the bullets just bounce this tick metal skin. He started firing and he shot 4, the other ones tried to run to the car. \"NO YOU WONT!\" Azathoth yelled and he used this incredible strength and stomped the vehicle. \"Now we can start this party!\" the half deep ones tried to counter attack with this pistols but nothing changed. Azathoth grabbed one and crushed this skull with these bare hands, he shot three to death with this colt and machine gun; he blazed 1 to death with a thick cylindrical magenta/red heat ray that emanated from this crimson eye. \"COME ON! GIVE ME A CHALENGE!\" he yelled, and then he realized that only one was left. \"Oh…damn I wanted a massacre. Well my good friend, come here\" but before he can grab this new prisoner a bullet came to this skull, Azathoth saw that 2 more cars came. \"Oh…YES MORE FUN!\" he welcomed this new \"guests\" with this heat ray; a few ones changed their ammo and used armor piercing. The bullets were now making dents in the body of the armored god. But then they started to self-repair. \"YES, this is the real deal!\" he did 4 head shots and destroyed the two cars that came with this heat ray, some of the half fish men tried to enter the house from the back, but they saw with horror a large creature with a vertical mouth and large pink eyes located in both parts of the divided head, he had two right arms fused into one and two left that were identical, with large nails. The main body was shaggy with black and some purple hair. \"What in Dagons name is that!\" one of them asked before being eaten by the giant. The ex-outer god was enjoying like a maniac that the cars that he fried had some occupants and they got out of them showered in flames \"THATS WHAT I CALL EXTRA CRISPY!\" the daemon yelled to this frightened fish enemies. Only 5 were left and they tried to run to the exit, but before that can happen Azathoth flicked this finger and the giant vertical mouth monster appeared and lunged to the remaining ones and eaten them. Only one was left…again. \"Gug, go were you belong\" Azathoth flicked this fingers again and the monstrosity disappeared. \"Thanks CLAXTON, thanks Bertie\" he returned to the university. It had some gun holes but nothing that can be easily repaired.\"Hey master, are you in one piece?\" he asked to the young that was in the ground. He grabbed the shocked boy and handed him to the messenger. Put him in this home. He grabbed the survivor knocked him down with a flick of this finger and put him in the jail of the basement \"Well…that was exiting\""]}
{"id": "EN047", "pair": ["Professors Schultz and his entire team had reunited the night their space probe The Nautilus, was floating towards a landmark, it has gone farther than any other space probe. Oh what wonderful things they would discover from that point onward. Each had their own ideals of what they would find and prove that there might be more than what others in their field so strongly believed.For the deeply religious young man, Geralds, who entered the program through luck and his computer skills at twenty-four, he thought that they would find God.Schultz mocked such an idea. He and the majority of the team believed that such more galaxies would be found, hopefully they would include inhabited planets that they could attempt to contact.But one amongst them was nervous. George Sunderland, an old resident of Portland Rhode Island, he was an astro-nut like the rest of them, but on the side, it was revealed some time after their project jettisoned into space, that during down times in one field, he worked in another. And his other, strange field was the occult.\"Fhtagn,\" He breathed under his breath. \"Fhtagn, fhtagn, fhtagn.\"He chanted, hoping that it would protect him. Granted, he reminded himself prior to this that The Nautilus did not go between Hydra and Argo Navis, but the thought still scared him.On the machines before them, it showed exactly where it was. When it reached the landmark, were there cheers, the sounds of champagne popping, and congratulations were shared once more.On the large monitors before them, stars were few and far in between that it was as if they were traveling away from them and not moving towards anymore after them.Geralds was the first to point this out. He was also the first to see the mult-colored aurora that one would never expect to see in space.\"Its like the surface of a bubble,\" Andrea, second oldest member to Schultz stated.Schultz scoffed and was beginning his rant against her, when The Nautilus floated past the aurora and found darkness. A void darker than space itself, yet just light enough due to iridescent orbs that floated in a semi-orderly orbital around an unknown object.\"What is this place?\" Andrea asked.\"Not what, Andrea,\" A voice grated through nowhere. \"But who?\"A giant glowing bubble appeared before the camera. Geralds stood up, overjoyed; he exclaimed his love for God and happiness at finding him. But the grating voice merely chuckled.\"No, Geralds,\" It said, sounding like a six year old and twenty year old and sixty year old man speaking together. \"Not God; at least, not your Christian god. I am, and Sunderland will confirm this,\" The man shivered at his name. \"Yog-Sothoth; past, present, future…Time itself, is all within me.\"\"But what is this?\" Andrea asked.\"This is me.\" The multi-layered voice said. \"What you see is a form of mine. The Gate; right Sunderland.\"All eyes turned to their cowering companion. With a few inhales of the nose, he nodded, a whimper escaping him.\"And within each bubble is a plain; a piece of the bigger picture.\"\"And whats that?\" Schultz asked.\"That your universe; your world; your reality is expanding and shrinking in what-for your mental stability-well say random order.\"\"Preposterous!\" Schultz snapped.Yog-Sothoth chuckled, the intertwined voices sounding exotic over the speakers. It was not malignant-it sounded good natured compared to what Sunderland had expected.\"You see those two bubbles sticking together?\"No one spoke, but there was a sense that there did not have to be. That he could see them as well as hear them. Unsettling though it was, the information presented to them was to the same effect. Poor Sunderland seemed to have already cracked under the circumstances; cowering under a desk.\"They are other universes. Other galaxies; some inhabited, some not. But when they intertwine like that, the barrier of the bubble fades, allowing them to seemingly overlap. Like a continuation of itself. Your own has done so with many of them and has been one of a few to be graced with the central hub, so to speak.\"Schultz was finding this hard to swallow. Being a man of science; something like this was a freak accident not hard fact…Until now, since it was staring them in the face. Leaving skepticism behind; he found infinite possibilities. Keeping his mind wide open seemed to help a little, though. After all, science was still discovering new things almost everyday.\"Whats in the central hub?\" Geralds asked.\"Rlyeh,\" Came the instant reply.At that, Sunderland let out a scream. No one paid him any mind, though, for they were, for a brief second that in the scheme of things that could be said that it did not happen, overcome with primal urges and long lost images transmitted thousands upon thousands of generations before themselves.\"Sunderland,\" Yog-Sothoth said. \"Do not be frightened. Nothing can hurt you right now.\"Sunderland laughed long and hard. Everyone became uneasy except their translucent, shining friend.\"Right now he says.\" Sunderland cracked up, stuttering phrases together in a jumble of unheard sentences.\"If you wish to know more, Schultz, may I ask that you turn The Nautilus in that direction.\" The bubble seemed to turn to the right. \"Theres someone who will do a better job at explaining things in a-and dont be offended by this-lemans terms.\"Goaded on by what the bubble said, the satellite took off to the right. Everyone but Sunderland waited in bated breath at the edge of their seat. Then an insane, cacophonous symphony of flutes was heard.Sunderland snapped out of his babbling mess and stood abruptly, dashing towards Schultz.\"We have to stop this!\"\"We cant,\" Geralds began.\"The Nautilus moves according to projection, we didnt have the financial ability to control it back when we made it.\" Andrea finished.Sunderland made a warrior cry as he ran towards the screen. He beat at it, breaking it in places, but the image still shown through.\"No! No! No!\" He said between beatings. But the image never disappeared, but was, thankfully, distorted.There came a sound of bumping into something beneath the louder cacophony flutes. Sunderland saw an eye open. An eye that was never supposed to open. The Nautilus turned away due to impact, but the damage was done. Sunderland was in a fit of hysterics, writhing on the floor, laughing as his mouth foamed.He looked into the eye of chaos and it stared back with a mind blowing intensity. The distorted image shown next was of bubbles stacking upon themselves and became a vertical line orbiting around the central hub. But they popped.The media was in a frenzy. Children were amazed at seeing real life Pokémon in their back yard. Three teens who broke down in the middle of nowhere found a camp that was not there before and were killed by a man in a hockey mask. Teens who lived on Elm Street started to die in their dreams. A couple were eaten by a giant white worm in Perfection, Nevada. Reports of Batman fighting the Joker were rampant in New York. In Louisiana, there was a report of a man covered in moss and roots walking in the swamp.In London, there were sightings of a man in a Guy Fawkes mask walking around in shadows and on roofs.In the Middle East there were reports of Orcs raiding caves.(1) But Japan had gotten it worst. Godzilla attacks, a strange yet beautiful rider on a mechanical horse, an orange clad ninja, and giant robot fights became an everyday event.\"The world as we knew it is gone!\" Sunderland screamed in his padded cell in Arkham Asylum. \"It popped! Just like a bubble!\"", "The Judas Mark\"Cthulhu ftaghn,\" He said with a laugh, swaying his tilted head to the right in a drunken manner. \"Cthulhu ftaghn.\"He broke out into a laughing fit. Then as quickly as it started it stopped; like the lightning bolt outside his window. Arkham was his place of work. And as a patient, his work was hard to complete. Not like he wanted to do it, either.The rain stopped.\"I hear youuuuuuu.\" He chuckled. \"I hear you flapping those blasted wings outside my windah.\" He giggled, then sobered up. \"Damn Migo. YA CANT HAVE MY BRAIN!\"There came a drum of plastic on metal as his attention was drawn to the orderly with a plastic flashlight. Aforementioned light shining into his padded room.\"Keep it down in there!\" The orderly snapped before leaving him alone once again.\"Power outage, eh?\" He chuckled. \"Wonder whyyyy.\"He rolled his head back to his right; towards his window. His eyes registered the sound of unearthly wings twitching like insects contemplating flight. Oh how he hated those damn things. Far worse than those Shoggoths he faced a while back. At least the Shoggoths ate you; thus ending your torment. But a Migo…He shuttered. He did not want to think about it.\"Nyarlahotep…You son of a bitch.\" He said, looking grumpy, then broke out in hysterics, then going back as if it never happened. \"If it werent for you…Id be…Id be…\"Where would he be? In his mind, he saw himself in Miami, laying on the beach with Lucinda, their two kids playing in the sand as the waves crashed soothingly onto the shore. But then his logic would kick that to the curb. Lucinda was showing signs…She would have dumped him if it werent for that Deep One, that is, dragging her-kicking and screaming-to the bottom of the sea.He would be away from his insane parents. That insane town of Dunwich. Even if Lucinda did not accompany him, he would, at least, be free from here. But then he met him.\"Jesus…\"\"Yes?\" Came a sweet, velvety voice. A voice one would hear from royalty.\"Not you.\" He snapped.\"But I am him.\" A hand placed itself on his shoulder as the entire figure appeared, sitting beside him like they were best friends.\"No...Youre the fucking antichrist.\"\"Is there really a difference in that either?\" Jesus asked, a smirk gracing his regal, black lips. \"Both promise paradise. From there, its on a persons opinion on what that is.\" He chuckled. \"And do not tell me that you forgot your title, Ivan…Or should I say Judas?\"\"THEN WHY PLACE ME HERE?\" Ivan shouted.\"Hey!\" The orderly shouted, banging his flashlight on the bars again. \"What did I just say?\"The orderlys face began to bubble. His flesh boiled, broken screams erupted from his face. He collapsed and scratched at his face, letting more and more blood poor onto the floor.\"I hate interruptions.\" Jesus said. \"And as for your answer…Because. If Jesus was as all powerful as he claimed, why did he allow Judas to stay in the fold? Why did he allow the lowly wretches hope? Why did I command Tython to drag Lucinda down to the depths to suffer being rendered by hungry maws before she could drown?\"He smirked evilly as he described Lucindas gruesome demise. Ivan panted heavily, his rage rising faster than Rlyeh ever would to the surface. Ivan struck thin air as his body moved too slow for the deity; whom was already standing, laughing at the mortal.\"Because theres more to it, Judas.\" Jesus said. \"Judas of old was an important player in the world. The wretches were a growing populace, if they loved him, they would worship him.\"\"Bullshit!\" He spat.\"Is it?\"\"We want you to betray us, Judas.\" Jesus said after his question was ignored.\"Why?\"\"Sorry, but us Christs keep some secrets from their disciples.\"\"What makes you Jesus?\"\"Our roles.\" He stated simply. \"You see…He was supposed to preach about us. But, sadly, his mind couldnt take it. So Cthulhu became a god. Not like it matters, religion changes all the time.\"He smirked, all knowing. \"And no, he wasnt the son of Cthulhu. That was my little trick.\"\"Pray Judas,\" He said from behind Ivan-not allowing him to speak-his black, decaying lips mere inches from his ear. \"He likes that. It makes him feel powerful.\"\"No,\" Ivan said. \"I shall not ya damned bastard! And I wont bring about their reawakening! These crazies will remain sedated!\"Jesus laughed.\"Thats my cue.\"Jesus grabbed Ivan by the neck and slammed his body against the wall. Buzzing from outside the window grew from a silent drone into a frenzy. Jesus smirked evilly, drawing his face closer to his Judas.\"In blood the mark is drawn.\"Nyarlahotep drew the blade he was hiding and slashed Ivans wrist, splattering drops of blood on the wall. He watched in delight as the drops spread, several linking up and continuing their intricate design.It consisted of a crude circle with intertwining tentacles and a pair of piercing eyes.\"There,\" He said. \"Done.\"He tossed Ivan. He landed next to the window and as he peered out of it he clearly saw the glowing heads and beating wings of the Migo, their forms slightly covered by the rain that began to fall again.\"Enjoy your trip, Judas.\" Nyarlahotep said. \"For though I am done with you, you still serve a purpose.\"The Migo swarmed, the window shattering like paper. Ivan barely had time to scream as they worked on his skull, amputating his brain and placing it inside their jar.\"Cthulhu ftagn, indeed.\""]}
{"id": "EN059", "pair": ["The Great Arising was far worse than anyone could have imagined, how can one comprehend the forces that can wrench an entire continent from deep beneath the murky abyss until its twisted green-black spires towered over even the highest of mountains known to man? When Ryleh arose, millions returned to life, but billions of others died. The geologic upheavals, the shifting of plates swallowed whole countries and ground mighty cities to dust. Tidal waves swept hundreds of miles inland, wiping away much of the world as if it had never existed. Those who survived were in chaos, of the major world powers, only Russia retained some capability to strike back, and a hail of nuclear warheads struck the mighty walls of Ryleh, accomplishing nothing but achieving Great Cthulhus disfavor, and Moscow was struck with such force by the mighty priests weapons that an inland sea now sits where one of mans greatest super-powers once stood.America fared no better, the entire west coast collapsed beneath an earthquake of unthinkable magnitude, from California to Mississippi river, the east coast was left in ruins by what later scholars would term a \"worldquake\" . The shattered survivors, staring into the dust filled sky, watched as great, bloated creatures with dragons bodies and tentacled faces swarmed across the earth, eager to reclaim their world. Of course, there was resistance, in the early years, men struck out at the Star Spawn with every weapon at their disposal, and always the result was the same, the Star Spawn could not be injured, as they existed in multiple dimensions at once. Cthulhus other servants, however, were more vulnerable. Human cultists could be easily killed, and the amphibious Deep Ones, though hardier than men, were only flesh and blood. Man soon learned, however, that such small victories brought attention and terrible reprisal, so much so that humanity finally ceased to fight, struggling to simply survive beneath the feet of a race that barely even noticed their very existence.In truth, Cthulhu was not malevolent, simply amoral, beyond human concerns and desires. He neither desired nor caused most of the devastation wrecked upon humanity by the Rise of Rlyeh. Had he control over Rlyehs rising and falling, it would never have sunken to begin with. The sidereal clockworks governed Rlyeh and its inhabitants. When the stars were wrong they had to sleep, when the stars were right, they wee free to walk and fly and crawl. It was that simple. Humanity had suffered the simple misfortune of being in the wrong place at the wrong time, nothing more. Those that fought Great Cthulhu and his kin were minor irritants at best, his worshipers, useful beasts, of a little more import than Shoggoths, and a little less than The Brood of Dagon. The rest, simply another breed of animal that had flourished during his long sleep. Insignificant creatures which could be used to further his grand designs. Bizarrely, despite this view of humanity, Great Cthulhu had several children by human, or once human, mates, via some of his more humanoid avatars, of course. The children of these unions were known as Half-Bloods.This was fortunate, in many ways, for mankind. Great Cthulhu and his minions saw humans as useful pawns, if they saw them at all, so mankind was able to regroup into a primitive society, surviving under the radar. The Star Spawn rarely noticed the affairs of men, but the Half-Bloods did. The Half-Bloods, more often than not, hated their human side, feeling the need to be excessively cruel and brutal toward the people whose blood they so despised within their own veins. Some, however, were kindly disposed toward mankind...Torren-Wraeth was the son of an avatar of Great Cthulhu and Teree, an outcast woman of the Rapa Nui people, born on the island of the same name, which the Europeans would later re-name Easter Island. In form and mind he took more after his mothers people than his fathers. In many ways, he was attractive, even beautiful by human standards, though his striking Polynesian features and lithe swimmers build were offset by a eight small tendrils, three on each side of his lower jaw and two on his chin, his skin was emerald green rather than his mothers warm brown, his almond eyes yellow and cat-like, and slender, bat-like wings that spread from his shoulders. His straight black hair hung long and loose around his pointed ears, though occasionally he would braid it, for special occasions.He did not hate his human side, rather, he embraced it. His name, given by his father, loosely translated as Spirit of the Raging Waters, but his personality was far different, though his mothers people were fierce warriors and his fathers, cold, calculating and unfeeling, Torren-Wraeth was gentle. He befriended humans, or tried to, both before and after the Rise of Rlyeh. Teree still lived, she had been transformed into something more than human, but less than Star-Spawn, another of his fathers many concubines.As a Half-Blood Torren-Wraeth possessed abilities his True-Blood brethren lacked, while they could only communicate with human minds in sleep, Torren-Wraeth could communicate mentally with humans sleeping or awake, and, unlike his kin, he possessed vocal chords capable of actual human conversation. This, combined with his attractive appearance and gentle manner, made him a frequent messenger between his father and the humans who worshiped him. The Elder Sign, bane of his father and those like him, even other Half-Bloods, held no power over Torren-Wraeth. He did not know if this was a sign of favor from the Elder Gods whod crafted that mystical defense, or due to some innate part of his human nature.Rapa Nui... The people had all but died out long before the rise of Rlyeh, a combination of factors had led to their demise, systematic deforestation, a genocidal internecine war, followed by starvation. The final nail in the coffin of the Rapa Nui was the arrival of the Europeans in 1722, who brought with them disease, mistreatment and slavery. Torren-Wraeth had wanted to help them, even though they had rejected his mother, rejected him... He had implored his father to intervene, but to no avail. They were not servants of Cthulhu... Torren-Wraeth had never truly forgiven his father...The island itself, with its famous Moai statues, now rested in a low valley on the Southwestern portion of Rlyeh, if such directions could be applied to the non-euclidean, extra-dimensional hyper-geometry of the dark city. Its few inhabitants, mostly descended of mixed Rapa Nui and European blood, now lived literally in the shadows of Rlyeh . Torren-Wraeth visited often, protecting his mothers people. He erected again the fallen Moai, many toppled by the Rapa Nui themselves during and after their horrific civil war, moving tons of stone with his bare hands. It was important to him, so much human blood, sweat and tears had gone into the making of the Moai, they symbolized the pride of a people, his people.Torren-Wraeth flapped his leathery wings lazily, mainly gliding along the strong winds that whipped through the black city whose structures loomed higher than the eye could see. Occasionally one of his massive half-siblings would glide by, surprisingly graceful for their incredible size, or stare impassively out from the portals of their stone domiciles. He knew they neither loved nor hated him, they merely acknowledged his existence even as they acknowledged their own. A cold, unfeeling people, the Cthuli, H.G. Wells description of his Martian Minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish, intellects vast and cool and unsympathetic aptly fit the Star Spawn . Far below him, Torren-Wraeth could see the slithering shapes of near-mindless Shoggoths, and he strained to see if, by chance, a Deep One, a Gyo-Jin, as his dearest friend had called them, lurked below. At least they had some feelings akin to those of humanity. He saw none. He was utterly alone in a city of millions.Then the loneliness, the aching struck at his heart. Japan was gone, destroyed in the tectonic cataclysm of The Arising. Though Rapa Nui was his birthplace, his heart had been in Japan. Many years ago, his father had sent him to that land to forge an alliance with the Emperor. The alliance had been refused, but while in Japan he had met Goro. Goro had been assigned as his personal servant during his stay, and the two had become fast-friends, once the seemingly insurmountable barriers of class were broken. He had healed Goros troubled mind, entering his dreams, soothing his nightmares. Goro had lived a life of suffering and loss, and his nights were filled with terrible nightmares and even more terrible realities, something that touched Torren-Wraeths heart. For the first time, he truly felt human suffering, he truly understood that side of himself, all the hopes and fears and pains... Such pain...When he left Japan, he took Goro with him. They traveled the world for over 200 years, Torren-Wraeth drawing on his fathers power to keep Goro young and healthy. They truly cared for each other, like brothers born. Torren-Wraeth even allowed Goro to call him Torren-kun, no one, other than his mother, could have referred to Torren-Wraeth like that. But Goro was different... He would even have accepted Torren-chan, though Goro never could shake off his shackles of low-self esteem to be so familiar with the son of Kami... Hed never truly understood, Torren-Wraeth needed Goro far more than Goro needed him. Goro made him feel... Human...Hed truly loved him, not in the way of ... Shonen-Ai, was it called? Even if Torren-Wraeth had been so inclined, Goro had already suffered far too much of that kind of love. It was difficult for Torren-Wraeth to describe in the terms of either of his parents tongues, a blending of souls, perhaps? He was a companion, a friend to whom he could open up his innermost heart without fear, and he strove to repay such care in kind. But time takes its toll, and Goro simply began to lose interest in this life, he yearned to be reunited with his long-dead family, and, finally, Torren-Wraeth let him go. He visited him often, watching in his ageless agony as Goro raised a family, grew old, and finally died. Death, even Half-Bloods had little concept of death, such loss was unknown to his fathers people. He had experienced loss for the first time in his young life, and this foreign agony crushed him. The pain he felt had never truly gone away, it had left a gaping hole in his soul... A void as deep and dark as the gulf between worlds. He had wept and raged and screamed to the heavens, angry at himself for letting Goro die, angry at Goro for wanting to live as a normal man, for wanting to die. But he came to accept that forcing immortality upon Goro would have been cruel, forcing him to live a life he no longer wanted just for his own sake would have been selfish. He had finally come to peace with himself,but God, did he miss him...Goros descendants were safe, though, even if Japan was gone, Torren-Wraeth had saved them, guiding them for decades, preparing them the best he could. He finally took them to the relative safety of Canada as the end became certain, gave them the signs and words to ward off any of his kin who might do them harm. It was the best he could do, under the circumstances.The jumbled spires of Rlyeh fell away, opening onto a gloomy sea. He shook his head to clear his thoughts. Africa lay ahead, just a short jaunt on his powerful wings. The survival of Africa was almost as miraculous as the survival of Australia (which was directly adjacent to Ryleh), buffeted by tsunamis and earthquakes, rent and torn almost beyond recognition, but still there.He turned to look back, and the greenish-black stone of Rlyeh blocked his view for as far as he could see, blotting out horizon and sky with its incredible bulk. It was unnatural, in more ways than one, Rlyeh was less a continent than a great, graven image to Great Cthulhu and to his god, Yog-Sothoth, The Key and The Gate. Torren-Wraeth knew that, someday, Rlyeh would simply fade away from its earthly presence and re-appear on some other, more desirable world. They were, after all, only temporary residents on this planet, Rlyeh was little more than a great city-engine to leech all it could from earth before leaving for greener pastures in an endless, soulless cycle of domination and devastation. He hoped silently that humanity would live to see that day when Great Cthulhu and his hordes left their world forever. He often wondered, if, when that day came, he would go with them...But he knew the answer to that. He would go. He had to go. The humans had a saying, at least before the Great Arising \"Hell is other people\", but they were wrong, oh so wrong. Hell is being alone...", "Joseph Clayton watched from his seat on the center aisle as Pete Tallier finished his act. The young man had performed a folk-dance from his ancestral Quebec, a homeland his family had left more than a century ago for jobs in the New England furniture industry. He himself had finished his act more than an hour ago, having opted for a simple folk dance and traditional Norman costume with a top hat. Of course, using a hat-rack instead of a dancing partner had been a bit... unusual; with Marie being so involved in her own routine, he had had to make do with what he could get.But now, as Joseph finished clapping in approval of the previous act, he realized that his girlfriend was due to come on. What would actually happen was a complete mystery to Joseph; Marie had kept a tight lid on her act by practicing at home and while she had spent much less time with him than normal, she had stressed how important this was for her. So, respecting her wishes, hed kept his distance and wished her luck. Now, with his parents sitting beside him, the Trinhs just across the aisle and after weeks of mystery, he was finally about to discover what the big secret was.The male student in charge of the event came forward after Tallier left the stage, dressed in traditional Greek costume. \"Next up is Marie Trinh, who will be performing a traditional journey rite in two parts from the Annamite Mountains of Vietnam and Laos. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you The Stork Dance!\" He exited downstage right as the lights dimmed even further than they had, the only illumination the bright center of the spotlight focused on the place he had been. Slowly, almost dramatically, the spotlight edged back towards the rear wall until it revealed a lone figure wrapped in a white cloak, face obscured by something.Utter silence pervaded the auditorium before the sound system gave off the squeal of a needle scratching on a record and the sounds of soft, high flutes began wafting upon the air. It was then that the figure started walking forward on bare feet, segmented anklets of carved jade just visible below the hem of the long, black skirt while the white cloak draped over the arms and... it almost looked like some sort of hat or strange mask was concealing the figures head. Suddenly, pipes of a lower pitch, possibly oboes, started playing a mournful tune and the figure stopped suddenly, lifting its head to face the crowd.A spoonbill... with a black beak. So that was what that big fuss with the paper-mache was about.The dance was in two parts. The first was a mournful, melancholy arrangement that supposedly was intended for farewell ceremonies. Zithers, oboes, various other instruments of the right mood and the creaky, brittle, almost sad songs of old women set the tone for the dance, a carefully choreographed routine that either imitated the intricate placement of a wading birds steps or imitated the slow soaring of those same birds. This was the Song of Departure. The second part, that of Arrival, was more...upbeat in its cadence. After the record was flipped, the plucking of lutes and brighter zithers, the delicate clanging of some sort of bells, jollier wind instruments and the celebratory singing of young women replaced the melancholy mood of earlier. The dancers steps also changed, with sudden, sprightly movements becoming the norm as imitations of courtship displays and feeding were performed.Throughout the dance, the audience had been enraptured by what was happening onstage. While Joseph was certainly enjoying his girlfriends act, he was not so enraptured that he failed to notice that several very strange things were happening in the darkened theater. The first change he noticed was the background odor. Slowly, over the course of the act, the smell in the theater had changed from the dry, dusty smell of upholstery and the hot metal of lighting equipment to... well, there was river mud, water thick with life, plants growing in the sun and warm wind. It wasnt a bad smell, but there was no real way that it could be coming from anywhere in the building.Other strange things were... shapes in the darkness. During the first part of the dance Joseph could have sworn that he glimpsed shadowy shapes moving in the aisle beside him, shapes that almost looked like... wading birds. During the second act, he could almost imagine that the silvery shapes of gliding birds were being outlined by the residual glare from the spotlight, though that could easily be passed off as wafting dust.Except that there wasnt that much dust in the theater.Thirdly, and much less unusually, an elderly man with thinning, almost white curly hair, wire rim spectacles and a short beard was watching the performance with interest, almost... studying it. Joseph had never seen him in the town before, so who was he and why was he here?And had he or anyone else seen the apparitions?When the dance was done and Marie (who had revealed herself at the end of the dance by taking off her headdress and taking a bow) had left the stage, Joseph kept thinking on that thought during the remaining acts. The smell had faded and gone, the shadows and shapes were no longer there but the mere hint of their possibility shook him. He was a person of science, of logic, of well-produced nature documentaries; in the real world, things like this did not happen outside the heads of crazy people.However... the very thought of the ghostly shapes thrilled Joseph, filled him with fantastic wonders and terrors not felt since he was a boy of five. And, thought the young man, it did not truly matter if it was wonderful or terrible, or if Marie could control or even knew about this sort of stuff. All that truly mattered was that... well, at the level of base wonderment, the entire experience was remarkably exciting.Sinister? Maybe. Normal? Not in the least. But very definitely exciting.But... maybe it would be best not to mention it until Marie brought it up.LaterAfter the show, as students were putting away their costumes and props and donning their late-autumn outerwear, Joseph approached his girlfriend who, with dress, cloak and headpiece in a garment bag, was heading out the door after her parents. \"Hey, Marie... about what you did on stage tonight?\"\"Yes?\" Questioned Marie as she turned towards Joseph. As a courtesy, he would never mention it but he could tell that something was weighing on her mind. The impression that she was on the very edge of flight made it seem that, perhaps, she was aware that strange things had happened.Strange things... but not necessarily bad things.\"I just have to say that you really hit a crowd pleaser tonight. I dont think any of the other acts got as much applause as yours did.\" With that, Joseph saw Maries face lighten from the mask of apprehension that had been there into a gratified smile.\"Thanks. You wouldnt believe how grueling the practicing was and then the costume and making all those fake pendants and charms... after all that, I was hoping it would get a good reception.\" With that, she turned back and began walking out into the early night air, over to the parking space where her parents had parked their combination commercial van and personal conveyance.Joseph had actively resisted losing himself in the weirdness that had struck him in the auditorium. However, he could never resist losing himself in his girlfriends smile.Perhaps because one was familiar and one was a bit... odd.Running to catch up with Marie, he wanted to ask his girlfriend something. \"On a different subject, I was wondering if you were doing anything tonight. Maybe we could catch a movie, go bowling, something like that.\"\"Id like to but I really cant.\" They were almost at the Trinhs van when Marie leaned in close to Joseph to whisper conspiratorially. \"Dad got a call from the cops when the Polish guy was on. They arrested someone vandalizing the front of the shop, and well probably be busy all night with statements, forms, the insurance guys and all the other police stuff.\"Though he was disappointed, Joseph Clayton knew that something like this couldnt be delayed. \"Alright, maybe Ill see you tomorrow. Goodnight.\" After getting an answer back in the form of a goodnight kiss (which still made him blush despite himself), he watched Marie depart toward her parents vehicle. The question came back to him, after all these weeks, of who in this town could be angry or stupid enough to be implicated in the vandalism spree that had plagued the Leng Trinh restaurant.At Roughly the Same time, Glaston Police StationAs Constance Blake entered the interview room, she reflected on the fact that it had to have been a pretty slow couple of weeks when they pulled the Chief of Police out of her office for a break in a vandalism case. On the other hand, shed finished the normal paperwork an hour before and had been flipping through a fishing catalog with the squawk-box on beside her when Lt. Anderson had come in. Hed told her that theyd arrested some punk kid trying to bust up the Trinhs restaurant, the culmination in a series of events that had been the height of municipal intrigue for weeks. As she got a look at the culprit, she was a little surprised.\"Punk kid\" indeed.As she sat down across from suspect, Chief Blake tapped the case file, a few reports inside a paper folder, against the table. \"You know,\" she began dryly, \"we get quite a few idiots through here: gang members, druggies, people whove taken offense one to many times. We just havent ever got one who was this high up in the High School Math Club.\" She dropped the file in front of Than Quang Due, a young man who, besides having a Sino-typical naming structure, was short, thin, bespectacled and looked amazingly like a 12-year old for someone who was actually 15. He and his parents had moved here the the summer and had set up a jewelery shop a few blocks over from Leng Trinh. Up until this, Due had never been anything but a model student, a respectful son and a bright (if somewhat timid) young man. \"So, whyd you do it?\"Due looked at the middle aged woman with a gaze that mixed deference with surprise in the face of seeming insanity. \"Because no one else would! Because this town has tolerated... people like that for so long.\". There was a touch of bitterness in his voice but also surprise. Were these people so stupid that they didnt recognize a threat in their very midst?\"Look, I dont know whats going on, but I know that it stops right now.\" Constance stood up and, even at 51\", the sight of her leaning over the suspect should have been intimidating to the boy. But then Blake began asking almost rhetorical questions \"What is this about anyway? You ask out their daughter and get refused? Well, if that is it, this was between you, her and the Clayton boy. No need to get mad at her parents.\" It was then that another idea came to the Chief of Police. \"Or is this because theyre Hmong?\"At this, Dues face carried a look of utter incomprehension.\"Look, I realize that theres some bad blood carried over from the War. But you have to realize something too: this is America, the land of opportunity, of freedom. This is the land where people should be able to get away from the madness, where every little feud and squabble is best left back in the old country. Now, your parents and the Trinhs are going to be here soon and if youre smart, you will apologize; Thuc Van and Thanh Thi are good people, theyre liked in the community and as sure as God made little green apples, they didnt deserve any of this.\"It was then that realization dawned on Due. The people who had informed him and sent him on this mission had mandated secrecy... but apparently he and they werent the only ones good at keeping secrets.With a look that held a touch of arrogance, a smidgen of fascinated bewilderment and, especially in his grin, the hint that he was not totally mentally hinged, Due asked a question that infuriated Constance Blake. \"You have no idea what they are, do you?\""]}
{"id": "EN100", "pair": ["Professors Schultz and his entire team had reunited the night their space probe The Nautilus, was floating towards a landmark, it has gone farther than any other space probe. Oh what wonderful things they would discover from that point onward. Each had their own ideals of what they would find and prove that there might be more than what others in their field so strongly believed.For the deeply religious young man, Geralds, who entered the program through luck and his computer skills at twenty-four, he thought that they would find God.Schultz mocked such an idea. He and the majority of the team believed that such more galaxies would be found, hopefully they would include inhabited planets that they could attempt to contact.But one amongst them was nervous. George Sunderland, an old resident of Portland Rhode Island, he was an astro-nut like the rest of them, but on the side, it was revealed some time after their project jettisoned into space, that during down times in one field, he worked in another. And his other, strange field was the occult.\"Fhtagn,\" He breathed under his breath. \"Fhtagn, fhtagn, fhtagn.\"He chanted, hoping that it would protect him. Granted, he reminded himself prior to this that The Nautilus did not go between Hydra and Argo Navis, but the thought still scared him.On the machines before them, it showed exactly where it was. When it reached the landmark, were there cheers, the sounds of champagne popping, and congratulations were shared once more.On the large monitors before them, stars were few and far in between that it was as if they were traveling away from them and not moving towards anymore after them.Geralds was the first to point this out. He was also the first to see the mult-colored aurora that one would never expect to see in space.\"Its like the surface of a bubble,\" Andrea, second oldest member to Schultz stated.Schultz scoffed and was beginning his rant against her, when The Nautilus floated past the aurora and found darkness. A void darker than space itself, yet just light enough due to iridescent orbs that floated in a semi-orderly orbital around an unknown object.\"What is this place?\" Andrea asked.\"Not what, Andrea,\" A voice grated through nowhere. \"But who?\"A giant glowing bubble appeared before the camera. Geralds stood up, overjoyed; he exclaimed his love for God and happiness at finding him. But the grating voice merely chuckled.\"No, Geralds,\" It said, sounding like a six year old and twenty year old and sixty year old man speaking together. \"Not God; at least, not your Christian god. I am, and Sunderland will confirm this,\" The man shivered at his name. \"Yog-Sothoth; past, present, future…Time itself, is all within me.\"\"But what is this?\" Andrea asked.\"This is me.\" The multi-layered voice said. \"What you see is a form of mine. The Gate; right Sunderland.\"All eyes turned to their cowering companion. With a few inhales of the nose, he nodded, a whimper escaping him.\"And within each bubble is a plain; a piece of the bigger picture.\"\"And whats that?\" Schultz asked.\"That your universe; your world; your reality is expanding and shrinking in what-for your mental stability-well say random order.\"\"Preposterous!\" Schultz snapped.Yog-Sothoth chuckled, the intertwined voices sounding exotic over the speakers. It was not malignant-it sounded good natured compared to what Sunderland had expected.\"You see those two bubbles sticking together?\"No one spoke, but there was a sense that there did not have to be. That he could see them as well as hear them. Unsettling though it was, the information presented to them was to the same effect. Poor Sunderland seemed to have already cracked under the circumstances; cowering under a desk.\"They are other universes. Other galaxies; some inhabited, some not. But when they intertwine like that, the barrier of the bubble fades, allowing them to seemingly overlap. Like a continuation of itself. Your own has done so with many of them and has been one of a few to be graced with the central hub, so to speak.\"Schultz was finding this hard to swallow. Being a man of science; something like this was a freak accident not hard fact…Until now, since it was staring them in the face. Leaving skepticism behind; he found infinite possibilities. Keeping his mind wide open seemed to help a little, though. After all, science was still discovering new things almost everyday.\"Whats in the central hub?\" Geralds asked.\"Rlyeh,\" Came the instant reply.At that, Sunderland let out a scream. No one paid him any mind, though, for they were, for a brief second that in the scheme of things that could be said that it did not happen, overcome with primal urges and long lost images transmitted thousands upon thousands of generations before themselves.\"Sunderland,\" Yog-Sothoth said. \"Do not be frightened. Nothing can hurt you right now.\"Sunderland laughed long and hard. Everyone became uneasy except their translucent, shining friend.\"Right now he says.\" Sunderland cracked up, stuttering phrases together in a jumble of unheard sentences.\"If you wish to know more, Schultz, may I ask that you turn The Nautilus in that direction.\" The bubble seemed to turn to the right. \"Theres someone who will do a better job at explaining things in a-and dont be offended by this-lemans terms.\"Goaded on by what the bubble said, the satellite took off to the right. Everyone but Sunderland waited in bated breath at the edge of their seat. Then an insane, cacophonous symphony of flutes was heard.Sunderland snapped out of his babbling mess and stood abruptly, dashing towards Schultz.\"We have to stop this!\"\"We cant,\" Geralds began.\"The Nautilus moves according to projection, we didnt have the financial ability to control it back when we made it.\" Andrea finished.Sunderland made a warrior cry as he ran towards the screen. He beat at it, breaking it in places, but the image still shown through.\"No! No! No!\" He said between beatings. But the image never disappeared, but was, thankfully, distorted.There came a sound of bumping into something beneath the louder cacophony flutes. Sunderland saw an eye open. An eye that was never supposed to open. The Nautilus turned away due to impact, but the damage was done. Sunderland was in a fit of hysterics, writhing on the floor, laughing as his mouth foamed.He looked into the eye of chaos and it stared back with a mind blowing intensity. The distorted image shown next was of bubbles stacking upon themselves and became a vertical line orbiting around the central hub. But they popped.The media was in a frenzy. Children were amazed at seeing real life Pokémon in their back yard. Three teens who broke down in the middle of nowhere found a camp that was not there before and were killed by a man in a hockey mask. Teens who lived on Elm Street started to die in their dreams. A couple were eaten by a giant white worm in Perfection, Nevada. Reports of Batman fighting the Joker were rampant in New York. In Louisiana, there was a report of a man covered in moss and roots walking in the swamp.In London, there were sightings of a man in a Guy Fawkes mask walking around in shadows and on roofs.In the Middle East there were reports of Orcs raiding caves.(1) But Japan had gotten it worst. Godzilla attacks, a strange yet beautiful rider on a mechanical horse, an orange clad ninja, and giant robot fights became an everyday event.\"The world as we knew it is gone!\" Sunderland screamed in his padded cell in Arkham Asylum. \"It popped! Just like a bubble!\"", "III.Meanwhile Old Whateley continued to buy cattle without measurably increasing the size of his herd. He also cut timber and began to repair the unused parts of his house—a spacious, peaked-roofed affair whose rear end was buried entirely in the rocky hillside, and whose three least-ruined ground-floor rooms had always been sufficient for himself and his daughter. There must have been prodigious reserves of strength in the old man to enable him to accomplish so much hard labour; and though he still babbled dementedly at times, his carpentry seemed to shew the effects of sound calculation. It had already begun as soon as Wilbur was born, when one of the many tool-sheds had been put suddenly in order, clapboarded, and fitted with a stout fresh lock. Now, in restoring the abandoned upper story of the house, he was a no less thorough craftsman. His mania shewed itself only in his tight boarding-up of all the windows in the reclaimed section—though many declared that it was a crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at all. Less inexplicable was his fitting up of another downstairs room for his new grandson—a room which several callers saw, though no one was ever admitted to the closely boarded upper story. This chamber he lined with tall, firm shelving; along which he began gradually to arrange, in apparently careful order, all the rotting ancient books and parts of books which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously in odd corners of the various rooms.      “I made some use of ’em,” he would say as he tried to mend a torn black-letter page with paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove, “but the boy’s fitten to make better use of ’em. He’d orter hev ’em as well sot as he kin, for they’re goin’ to be all of his larnin’.”      When Wilbur was a year and seven months old—in September of 1914—his size and accomplishments were almost alarming. He had grown as large as a child of four, and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker. He ran freely about the fields and hills, and accompanied his mother on all her wanderings. At home he would pore diligently over the queer pictures and charts in his grandfather’s books, while Old Whateley would instruct and catechise him through long, hushed afternoons. By this time the restoration of the house was finished, and those who watched it wondered why one of the upper windows had been made into a solid plank door. It was a window in the rear of the east gable end, close against the hill; and no one could imagine why a cleated wooden runway was built up to it from the ground. About the period of this work’s completion people noticed that the old tool-house, tightly locked and windowlessly clapboarded since Wilbur’s birth, had been abandoned again. The door swung listlessly open, and when Earl Sawyer once stepped within after a cattle-selling call on Old Whateley he was quite discomposed by the singular odour he encountered—such a stench, he averred, as he had never before smelt in all his life except near the Indian circles on the hills, and which could not come from anything sane or of this earth. But then, the homes and sheds of Dunwich folk have never been remarkable for olfactory immaculateness.      The following months were void of visible events, save that everyone swore to a slow but steady increase in the mysterious hill noises. On May-Eve of 1915 there were tremors which even the Aylesbury people felt, whilst the following Hallowe’en produced an underground rumbling queerly synchronised with bursts of flame—“them witch Whateleys’ doin’s”—from the summit of Sentinel Hill. Wilbur was growing up uncannily, so that he looked like a boy of ten as he entered his fourth year. He read avidly by himself now; but talked much less than formerly. A settled taciturnity was absorbing him, and for the first time people began to speak specifically of the dawning look of evil in his goatish face. He would sometimes mutter an unfamiliar jargon, and chant in bizarre rhythms which chilled the listener with a sense of unexplainable terror. The aversion displayed toward him by dogs had now become a matter of wide remark, and he was obliged to carry a pistol in order to traverse the countryside in safety. His occasional use of the weapon did not enhance his popularity amongst the owners of canine guardians.      The few callers at the house would often find Lavinia alone on the ground floor, while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the boarded-up second story. She would never tell what her father and the boy were doing up there, though once she turned pale and displayed an abnormal degree of fear when a jocose fish-peddler tried the locked door leading to the stairway. That peddler told the store loungers at Dunwich Village that he thought he heard a horse stamping on that floor above. The loungers reflected, thinking of the door and runway, and of the cattle that so swiftly disappeared. Then they shuddered as they recalled tales of Old Whateley’s youth, and of the strange things that are called out of the earth when a bullock is sacrificed at the proper time to certain heathen gods. It had for some time been noticed that dogs had begun to hate and fear the whole Whateley place as violently as they hated and feared young Wilbur personally.      In 1917 the war came, and Squire Sawyer Whateley, as chairman of the local draft board, had hard work finding a quota of young Dunwich men fit even to be sent to a development camp. The government, alarmed at such signs of wholesale regional decadence, sent several officers and medical experts to investigate; conducting a survey which New England newspaper readers may still recall. It was the publicity attending this investigation which set reporters on the track of the Whateleys, and caused the Boston Globe and Arkham Advertiser to print flamboyant Sunday stories of young Wilbur’s precociousness, Old Whateley’s black magic, the shelves of strange books, the sealed second story of the ancient farmhouse, and the weirdness of the whole region and its hill noises. Wilbur was four and a half then, and looked like a lad of fifteen. His lips and cheeks were fuzzy with a coarse dark down, and his voice had begun to break.      Earl Sawyer went out to the Whateley place with both sets of reporters and camera men, and called their attention to the queer stench which now seemed to trickle down from the sealed upper spaces. It was, he said, exactly like a smell he had found in the tool-shed abandoned when the house was finally repaired; and like the faint odours which he sometimes thought he caught near the stone circles on the mountains. Dunwich folk read the stories when they appeared, and grinned over the obvious mistakes. They wondered, too, why the writers made so much of the fact that Old Whateley always paid for his cattle in gold pieces of extremely ancient date. The Whateleys had received their visitors with ill-concealed distaste, though they did not dare court further publicity by a violent resistance or refusal to talk."]}
{"id": "EN097", "pair": ["In 2050 an ill-conceived invasion of earth was launched by the Kalkars, a human-like, if excessively tall, race from a world called Va-Nah. They were led by a petty dictator called Orthis. It was spectacularly unspectacular, just another failed attempt to subjugate pre-cataclysmic humanity. However, it is notable for the reason that they had brought with them one thousand Va-gas, a lavender-hued slave race of quadrupeds with human-like faces and front limbs that doubled as arms. Not particularly intelligent at this stage of their development, the Va-gas were violent and cannibalistic, (Due in part to a lack of available food on Va-Nah) even preferring Va-gas flesh over that of other races. Fierce fighters with great strength, they also bred rapidly, making them very useful to their masters, since, as well as serving as soldiers, they also served as food for their brutal masters. The Kalkars, though arguably more intelligent than the Va-gas, were even worse. They (The Kalkars) grew fat, lazy and complacent, still, for over 200 years they managed to rule earth, mainly through dumb luck and petty cruelty. Unlike H.G. Wells luckless Martian invaders in War of the Worlds, the Kalkars could survive (And breed) quite well in earths atmosphere.Torren-Wraeth played no part in the earth-Va-Nah war, Goro had died in 2042 and the youth was lost in his own private agonies and recriminations. The Great Old Ones and Outer Gods mostly stood by on the sidelines, it did not concern them whether earth was ruled by humans or Kalkars, in the end, earth belonged to them. They felt the Va-gas had potential as servants, but the Kalkars were fairly useless to them. So the war was fought, mortal against mortal, bloody and cruel as all wars are. Orthis died early in the war, but it was a costly victory, for the human leader had perished with him. For every human victory, there was a terrible loss, Mankind was thrust into loose fifedoms and petty kingdoms in what the scholars call, The Second Dark Age, and the Kalkars Empire reigned supreme. But, as with all empires, they faltered... The conquerers degenerated, forgetting the technology of their ancestors. Eventually humanity rose up and all but wiped them out with little more than swords and knives. Inter-species breeding and The Great Arising had, apparently, finished the job.The Va-gas, being even less human-like and therefore more easily despised, were nearly wiped out as well, but they had won the favor of various powerful entities who rescued and found uses for them, particularly Shub-Niggurath. Torren-Wraeth had protected a small tribe of Va-gas as well, leaving them to protect his personal sanctuary, an abandoned shrine to Tsathoggua in Canada. It was here that he kept his most valued possessions and important artifacts. Many of Goros belongings were housed within the temple, as were priceless treasures rescued from oblivion during the Great Arising. Paintings, statues, books... The history of humanity protected by descendants of alien invaders within a temple to an alien god. The Toad God himself allowed the use of his sanctuary for this purpose, as he was both Torren-Wraeths great-uncle and too lazy and indifferent to truly care.The Va-gas had become more intelligent over the centuries, and those associated with Torren-Wraeth were far less vicious than their ancestors. They even lived in a sort of uneasy peace with the nearby human tribes, by human terms, they had been civilized. Once again, Torren-Wraeth wondered if it was right to impose human standards on non-human beings: Werent they better off, not killing and eating each other? Werent the local humans safer now? Hadnt he helped them? Isnt that what the colonialists he so hated always said? It was too late to wonder about that now...Torren-Wraeth had visited Va-Nah once, and only once, it was worse than RLyeh, worse than Tond, even. Even in its current state, earth was a far better place to live than that wretched hell-hole.Torren-Wraeth glided over the burgeoning town of New Yokohama, set up by Japanese refugees hed managed to ferry safely to Canada. It was named after Goros hometown, though few knew of Torren-Wraeths prior dealings with Japan, the Emperor and Shoguns had hushed everything up. Great Cthulhu, through Torren-Wraeth, had offered to make the Japanese Empire the greatest in the world, but they had refused. They could not accept one of the terms of the agreement, they could never bear the dishonor of mixing their blood with Gyo-Jin. They had no idea that some of their people were already involved with the Gyo-Jin, as were people in coastal areas all over the world...and Torren-Wraeth had not enlightened them. People looked up and waved, Torren-Wraeth was well-liked in New Yokohama, as he had saved the original founders from certain death.The Va-gas settlement, Black-Stone-Place, was primitive, huts of wood and stone arraigned in a semi-circle around the black stone temple. Va-gas usually dwelled in Tepee-like structures, but these were settled, as guardians of the temple, they naturally remained in its vicinity. They even had a rude form of agriculture, though this was mainly for animal feed, as Va-gas vastly preferred meat over vegetables. They raised some pigs and horses for convenient food, but they were mainly hunters, deer, wild hogs, wild horses, and moose were abundant. They, like most Va-gas on earth, worshiped The Black Goat of The Woods With A Thousand Young, and a shrine of antlers and bone lay at the apex of the crescent shaped village. It was here that the Goats Dark Young came to collect their sacrifices and accept their worship, for the Dark Young were Shub-Nigguraths proxies, as Torren-Wraeth was Cthulhus.The Va-gas chieftain, Walks-With-The-Wind, met Torren-Wraeth as he landed. He stood upright on his hind limbs, and extended a three-digited paw in greeting. \"Welcome back. May The Mother of All bless you.\" His black hair was beginning to gray, but his grip was strong. \"And may she bless you, my friend.\" Torren-Wraeth replied, \"Hows hunting?\" A small crowd of Va-gas of various sizes and ages gathered around the Half-Spawn, \"The Mother has granted us abundance.\" \"Im glad to hear it. Any problems with the humans?\" Walks-With-The-Wind paused thoughtfully, \"No, humans rarely come, and none enter the temple.\" \"The guardian must be lonely.\" Of course, the guardian was never lonely, even if it did not have twelve heads to keep itself company, it lacked such mortal attributes as loneliness and boredom, but it possessed the key that made it an invaluable guardian, loyalty. At the mention of the guardian, the Va-gas drew back as one, they feared it, that terrible spirit with twelve heads on long, scraggly necks and twenty legs on its globular body. It had not been his intention to frighten the superstitious Va-gas, but he had. \"Im going to visit the temple. Thank you for guarding it so well.\" Torren-Wraeth smiled, and made his way through the parting creatures. They wouldnt set foot in the temple, they believed it to be filled with captive human souls from the Great Arising, despite Torren-Wraeths assertions to the contrary.The temple was of black stone, squat and rectangular, with massive stone doors.Torren-Wraeth entered the temple.", "A smile lit Goros dark face. He looked down at the elegant dark blue kimono in his arms. \"Its beautiful.\" Torren-Wraeth smiled in return, he loved to see Goro smile. \"It belongs to you, Goro-chan.\" \"But, this is too...\" \"You deserve it far more than any pampered noble.\" The dark-skinned youth blushed. \"Thank you, Torren-kun!\" As Goro dressed, Torren-Wraeth looked at his own kimono, bright red and fashionable. He had worried about attracting undue attention with the appearance of wealth, but he decided that he was strong enough to risk any human robber or thief. Besides, this was to be their first trip to the Kabuki theater. It had taken enough time and effort to make himself appear human, he might as well show off. He looked up at Goro, partly dressed and excitedly pulling himself together. He thought of the men who had abused him, and felt a twitch of rage... Goro must never find out what Torren-Wraeth had done to those men. He did not want Goro to ever even hear the name YGolonac, much less learn what he was, how he dealt with his victims. Torren-Wraeth loathed YGolonac, the Defiler, the Obscenity, the obese, headless god of depravity, who devoured his victims slowly with the mouths in the palms of his flabby, groping hands. But he had to avenge Goro, he had to make them pay for using him, for torturing him, for robbing him of his childhood and his innocence. Only YGolonac could grant the punishment those men deserved... Then Goro was standing there, smiling, in his blue kimono, and Torren-Wraeth was happy again...Torren-Wraeth awoke slowly, not wanting to leave his dream, because Goro still lived in his dreams... He was in China, not Japan, in the Monastery of The Order of The Bloated Woman. Japan was gone, Goro was gone, and Torren-Wraeth was still here. Warm tears ran down his cheeks, but he brushed them away. Life had to go on, and on, and on...Great Cthulhu was concerned. Hastur seemed to have gained some favor in Nyarlathoteps many eyes, and anything that benefited Hastur weakened Cthulhu, in both their eyes. \"My Lord Cthulhu, there is no need for concern,\" The tall, red-robed figure that stood at the side of Cthulhus throne moved forward respectfully, Chxixsas bone-white face seemed to swim within his voluminous robes, \"It is well known that the fruits of Nyarlathoteps attentions are rarely to be desired.\" The voice was thin, hollow, distant, \" This may prove, in fact, a setback for The King in Tatters. Even now he trembles in his palace at Carcosa, fearing what manner of spawn this union may unleash.\" Cthulhu gave the equivalent of a laugh, \"Can you picture them, The Black Wind knocking down the walls of Carcosa, the Bloody Tongue crushing that cursed palace into dust! Oh, one can dream, Chxixsas... One can dream...\"The two masks, the Golden Angel and the Slender Maiden stood side by side, Isnt it all a lie, in the end? Torren-Wraeth bowed politely before the Bloated Woman. She was holding the Black Fan under her eyes, giving the illusion that she was a slender young lady, at least to the humans present. Ho Fong stood by reverently, but his jealousy of Tek was as strong as ever. Torren-Wraeth wondered if The Bloated Woman would play them against each other...He hoped not, for both their sakes. \"It is an honor to again have the presence of the Son of Cthulhu in my humble monastery.\" \"The honor is all mine,\" Torren-Wraeth replied softly, \"My father sends his greetings and good-will toward you, My Lady.\" The Bloated Womans nose-tendril curled delicately in the air, \"No doubt. Send him my good-will in return.\" Torren-Wraeth couldnt help but look at the sacrificial altar, where human victims had their arms cut off by the sacred sickles, after which they bled to death. He shuddered slightly at the horrible images flashing through his mind. The Bloated Woman noted this, but politely made no mention of it. Torren-Wraeth honestly could not condemn her, almost all of the worshiped entities, including his own father, demanded human sacrifice, many in even more horrible ways... \"I regret that I have to leave so soon, though I am grateful for your hospitality.\" The last part, at least, was true. \"May The Key and The Gate be with you.\""]}
{"id": "EN092", "pair": ["An autumnal chill descended upon the streets of Glaston as the young man walked upon the concrete sidewalk, passing redbrick storefronts and shop windows, every surface still wet with the morning rain. Leaves, red and orange and each vibrant in their hue, were shaken loose from the trees lining the street by the wind, landing wherever they fell. For an instant in time, the spectacle of the leaves drew the attention of the man, in fact little more than a teenage boy, as he made his way toward the corner. However, Joseph Clayton, clad in bluejeans and jacket with a backpack slung from his shoulders, had far more important things to focus on than a show of falling leaves. An important test for this semester was arriving in a week or so and he needed to study.Also, he was getting quite hungry this close to lunch.As Joseph rounded the corner and continued toward his favorite eatery, he wondered if he would get swamped in the usual lunch crowd. However, as he saw the front of the Leng Trinh Restaurant, his thoughts turned to quiet dejection.\"Damnit!\" muttered Joseph as he approached the eatery. The reason for this turn in mood was the carpet of tempered glass fragments on the sidewalk below the picture window at the front of the establishment, which was now covered by plastic sheeting. Thuch Van Trinh, one half of the husband-and-wife ownership, was wearing a plaid jacket over his apron and usual cooking clothes and was shoveling the broken glass into a bucket. \"Hey, Mr. Trinh, hows it going?\". Joseph asked with a smile. This was more false cheer than anything, as Joseph could guess how Thuch must be feeling: anger was always a popular choice, followed closely by worry about the reason why.Despite what he must have been feeling, Thuch Van Trinh grinned back, the black lines of his facial tattooing creasing as the muscles moved under his cheeks. \"Not so good, Mr. Clayton. If this keeps up, I may have to put in Plexiglas so that the window wont break.\" The Trinhs accents, as his parents and the other adults of the town told it, had been rather strong (even unusually so) when they had immigrated to Glaston from their first home in Boston. This had usually been waved off by their purported origins in the remote hills on the Vietnam-Laos border, seemingly collaborated by how their teeth had been dyed black. On the other hand, given their rural roots, their speed in adapting local speech patterns so that they now sounded more like second generation Americans (and especially their daughters complete lack of any accent except the local standard) did make for a puzzling situation. However, for their ease of assimilation and the food they served, they had become well-liked in the community.So why were things like this happening to them recently? \"How many times does this make this month; two, three?\" Joseph had to ask this, wondering if things were worse than he thought.\"Its happened three times already, this time not more than an hour ago. Thanh wants to install security cameras to watch the place and with how small and cheap they are now, I think we just might.\" An hour ago? Theyd smashed a picture window in broad daylight? Who in town could be that stupid or that angry? Josephs train of thought was broken then, when Thuch said something of much more interest to the younger man. \"By the way, if youre looking for Marie, shes helping her mother in the kitchen. Even without a window we seem to be doing good business.\" Thuch went back to his work and Joseph, not wanting to delay any longer, entered the restaurant.Just as Thuch had said, Leng Trinh still had its usual busy lunchtime crowd, albeit one that was concentrated near the back wall. Picking his way around tables packed with diners, Joseph finally arrived at a table set for two, a reserved sign upon it. Removing his backpack and laying it beside a chair, he sat down, shuffled off his coat and went to bury his nose in the menu.It always felt a bit odd to Joseph, eating in an ethnic restaurant where none of the diners were the same ethnicity as the cooks, or even from the same part of the world. However, none of it mattered when the food was as good as it was here.\"Now then, what would a fine, upstanding New England boy like yourself want in a place like this?\" The voice that asked this was soft, amused, female and had an almost mocking tone. It also had the accent of the New England uplands. To Joseph, it could only be one person.\"The same thing I always get here.\" He answered dryly before looking up from the menu. There, holding a pad of paper and a pen, was teenage girl with almond-shaped eyes, shoulder length black hair with green streaks, a cooking apron and an amused grin. \"Hi Marie... you sure your moms alright with you waitressing this crowd?\"\"Weve got enough help in the kitchen already and Dads coming in after all the glass is cleaned up.\" She glanced up at the window, plastic sheet and all, after she wrote his order down. \"I just wish we knew who was doing this. If we dont get someone else to cough up some money, our insurance company might go sour on us.\" Marie went back to the kitchen to get the food for both of them.Ten minutes later, she was laying out two place settings of food that had been prepared ahead of time. \"Alright, thats two plates of grilled pork on beds of Leng-style rice, your dish of steamed green beans with soy sauce for dipping, my bowl of soup and two cans of soda.\" Theyd eat lunch before studying, with Joseph paying the tab for both of them.If anyone asked, it wasnt a date. Not in the strictest sense, anyway.\"What, no bak bon dzhow?\" Asked Joseph, decidedly disappointed at the apparent lack of the special ingredient.To this, Marie moved a small earthen bowl from the serving tray onto the table and lifted the lid to reveal a thick gray sauce containing mushrooms and cracked black pepper. \"Would I be one to deny you the gravy of the gods?\" She asked (rhetorically) with a soft smile; Joseph couldnt help but smile back as he cracked the tab on his soda and began on his green beans.A bit later, when his beans were gone and Marie had almost finished her soup, Joesph began formulating a question that related to a curious thought that had sprung up earlier. \"Not to sound like a nag or anything, but Im just curious but what was all that upstanding stuff about?\" The only time he had ever heard anyone talk like that was...Oh God...Marie swallowed the last bits of her soup. \"Oh, I dont know. Maybe Its that I had no idea that the son of insurance brokers had such deep and aristocratic roots? Maybe its that I was surprised to find out that the Claytons had come not from hardy New England farming stock as I had assumed, but from the urbane, wealthy ranks of those grand Brahmins of Boston? Im sure Granny Cora could tell some fascinating stories about the old days; she sure seemed interested in mine.\" If anything, Marie took the entire thing in stride, treating both the memory of the experience and the experience itself with a a great deal of interested amusement. Certainly, mocking the type of language she had encountered was almost cracking her up.Joseph, on the other hand, had first felt bemusement at the scene in which the Clayton family reunion of the past summer had found itself, quickly turning into outright embarrassment. \"Look, Im sorry that I didnt tell you about her, but everybody thought that she wouldnt be able to come due to health concerns. Its not my fault that a half-senile, 97 year old woman worked up enough stubbornness to drag her nurse halfway across the state!\".\"I never said anything about anyone being at fault. I just thought it was an interesting revelation about your family.\" She had meant her cajoling in good humour, but Josephs defensiveness and embarrassment were never good emotions to bring out. \"Anyway, most people would be proud to have the Boston gentry in their family history: industrialists, merchants, art, culture, philanthropy, charity...\" With every word, Marie spooned a bit of ban boc dzhow onto her grilled pork.\"As well as whaling, slave trading, opium smuggling, snobbery and having your entire life guided by the expectations of your peers; exactly the sorts of things my parents taught me to loathe. The thing is, my great-great-grandmother came from a very select, very privileged and lily-white background; I was worried that shed... well, react oddly to you.\" Joseph retorted as he began spooning (or rather, pouring) the sauce onto his meat after Marie had finished with it and passed it to him. In the case of Cora Clayton (nee Coffin), Josephs fear hadnt primarily been that she would find Marie objectionable on account of her race since that prejudice had been more ingrained in her parents generation than hers. His fear had instead been that his great great grandmother, as self-proclaimed guardian of the old, aristocratic traditions, might object to their relationship because the Trinhs were restaurateurs with no history of pedigree, education or money behind them.In Coras world (the 1920s, where her mind was half the time), heirs had married heiresses, families had coordinated their fortunes and everyone had kept an eye on everyone else; these were rules of decorum that had lasted for her long after the Claytons had gone bust in the great Crash of 29. The fact that she had taken Joseph aside and explained her concerns to him had done nothing to soothe his embarrassment, although he had finally convinced her that, being naturalized citizens with a successful restaurant, the Trinhs were firmly in the middling classes. She had also estimated that said restaurant, with no other inheritors besides Marie, would most likely pass into Clayton hands in the fullness of time.No one had dared explain to her the differences between modern teenage dating and the genteel courtships of her youth.\"I dont think she reacted that oddly. Sure, she was so out of date that you had to explain that I meant French Indochina when I said that my parents came from Vietnam and she did seem a bit too fascinated with my families origins and, alright, it was weird hearing someone actually use the word courting without trying to be funny. However, it was kind of nice to speak French with someone in this town after all the time my parents invested in me learning it.\" Marie knew that while it had been terrifying for Joseph, having to put up with his relatives dissection of his relationship and fearing disapproval, she herself had enjoyed a chance to see if the old stereotypes were true. When it had become clear to Marie that the elderly woman was not about to spew racial epitaphs at her but was, indeed, fascinated as to her families background, Marie had made it a point to ham it up in telling their story.To an entranced Cora Clayton, Marie had described her parents lives before emigration as a subsistence existence in a village high up in the fog-choked mountain passes. She had woven scenes of her people worshiping strange, heathen gods far from the civilized lands of the Buddha and partaking in ghastly rituals to ensure harvests of rice from narrow mountainside terraces. She told the old woman that her parents had tired of such a life and had dreamed of something more, something in the wider world glimpsed in third-hand magazines and radio broadcasts.After receiving a dispensation from their village shaman to leave (but promising to sent back remittances), they had made their way to Hanoi and then to Boston and finally to Glaston where, having never truly given up the more religious and symbolic aspects of their heathenish past, they nevertheless had made good names for themselves in the community. Marie had made sure that her prose had been both lurid and exotic so as to fully entrance a child of the Age of Empire as well as making proper use of tone, whether enraptured, casual or deathly serious, to emphasize mood. The end result was to make it sound as if her culture wasnt just some rural outlet of modern Vietnam or Laos, but as if it was truly unlike any other in the world.That was an opinion that Joseph was also rapidly adopting.They ate in relative silence for a while, the bustle of the lunch crowd beginning to die down as people left, many of them stopping to talk to Mr. Trinh at the till, expressing their concern over what had happened with the window. They were just about half done when Joseph began another conversation. \"So, did you know that theres a Heritage Day coming up at school in a few weeks?\"\"Yeah, and?\" Deep down in her gut, Marie was beginning to get a slightly worried feeling from the direction this conversation was going. This pretty much happened whenever the subject of her parents past came up but, like so many times before, she could probably bluff her way through it.\"I thought that, maybe, we could do something for it. I was thinking about dredging up something from Normandy because I didnt want to clog up the schedule with another variation of British regional culture.\" It sounded perfectly innocent, but Marie knew that this was a potentially tricky situation that might require misdirection, a convincing excuse and possible outright lying.She hated lying to Joseph.\"Alright then. You can do that, Ill do the Vietnamese thing and well knock em all dead.\" She answered with an enthusiasm that she hoped had betrayed nothing of her growing unease with the conversation. This seemed to provoke nothing but a non-committal murmur of agreement and thus, thinking that that was over with, she began eating again.However, that was not the end of it.\"By Vietnamese, do you mean the standard culture from around Hanoi... or the culture from your parents home village?\" Joseph asked, seemingly as if only for the purpose of clarification. There was much more behind it though, and whether it was just ingrained paranoia or any real danger of exposure, Marie knew that this was entering onto some very tenuous and potentially very dangerous ground. Still, the subject had to be breached.\"Arent they pretty much the same? I mean, sure, it was pretty rural back there, but whether village or city, we were all Viet: same language, same culture, same blood, same... pretty much everything, when you think about it.\" As denials went, this one wasnt half bad: sincere enough to be taken seriously and with enough internal logic that it wouldnt fall apart immediately in the face of the mildly educated mind.On this subject, however, Joseph had become rather more than merely mildly educated. He had observed things for a long time: a lot of little things and one or two big things for the most part. And he, after long deliberation and study, had discovered that some of those things just didnt match up.\"You know, there was a time when I could believe that. But... there are just too many deviations to discount.\" Joesph stopped eating all together, putting down his fork and looking his girlfriend straight in the eyes before closing and opening them again, as if to rally his thoughts. \"The food, for one thing, isnt like any kind of Vietnamese food Ive read about. Yes, you have the side dishes but thats about it for similarity. Second, your parents tattoos. Again, unlike any other group in Southeast Asia; the closest matches I could find were incised lines on bronze figurines from over two thousand years ago.\"He stopped again. \"And then theres the language you guys speak. Im fairly sure its in the Mon-Khmer group, but Ive been doing some research and... honestly, Ive seen words on this menu that Ive never been able to find in any other source. And Im not the only one whos noticed these things.\" Joesph saw panic flash across Maries eyes, though she tried to hide it. \"Most people dont pay attention and honestly dont care, and the ones who do notice just assume that you guys are either Hmong or some little minority that no-ones ever heard of... but even that doesnt match very well either. Its like you said, youre Viet... but what about all this other stuff?\"It was then that Marie could have ended it all: the doubts, the questions, the lingering curiosity... as well as twenty one centuries of secrecy, tradition and very likely her relationship with this young man. In the end, she decided to dodge again. \"What can I say? We were very rural.\" When Joesph just got this frustrated look on his face, Marie sighed, reached across the table and enveloped one of his hands with hers. \"Look, Ill try and dredge something up if I can, but I cant promise anything, okay?\"Joseph mulled on this lack of answers, but as the moment dragged on, his resistance wore down. \"Alright. If you dont want to talk about your culture, thats alright; lots of people come to America to get away from stuff. But I still am sorta curious.\" Then he changed the subject. \"Anyway, after we eat, we should begin studying for our tests. Do you want to go over the English or the Algebra first?\"\"We should do the Math first, then we can cool off with the Shakespeare. But we better not let the food get cold, what with how the sauce gets if allowed to sit for too long.\" Marie began eating again and, after a few beats, Joseph resumed as well.They stayed at that table for many hours, going over and revising their knowledge of maths and literature. However, already Marie wondered if there was something she could reveal, something that she could show about her parents culture that would not threaten expose them and, as the old saying went among her tribe, get them cut in half and buried in two graves.Later that night, The Trinhs upstairs apartmentTo Maries relief, her parents reaction to her plan wasnt anger. On the other hand, fear and worry could be almost as painful.\"I know how you feel about the Clayton boy. Hes well-liked, intelligent and his parents are our insurance agents.\" Thanh Thi Trinh began, speaking in her families particular dialect of Viet as she, Marie and Thuch Van sat around their dining room table. \"But I ask this of you: is Joesph and his interest in this celebration worth the risk of exposure and, may I add, possible death when this town realizes who we are, when they realize what we are?\" Thanh Thi had always been the more reserved, more cautious and, frankly, more paranoid spouse in this family when it came to their safety. Where her husband was the face of the restaurant, she ran the kitchen with an eye on the back door and all of their cooks. While Thuch made friendly at social gatherings, Thanh kept track of all possible escape routes and who was and wasnt looking at them. She kept track of any news about gangs and hate-group activity in the area, and about any other strange things.The sort of things that might lure out the kind of people who hunted their people.But Marie had prepared for this. \"Mother, I know the risks that revealing the secrets of our people would bring. However, I am counting on two circumstances to make sure that only the most benign and harmless information is portrayed.\" She rallied herself, knowing that the way she handled this could make the difference on how she presented herself to nearly everyone, especially Joseph . \"First, I must inform both of you that there are some people in this town, including my boyfriend, that realize that we are not quite from the mainstream culture of modern Vietnam.\" At this, both Thanh and Thuch got even more worried but they werent shocked, seeing as any bumpkin with an Internet connection could find that tribal tattooing wasnt really the rage in downtown Hanoi. \"The good news is that while these people realize that we belong to a distinct subgroup, they often deduce that we are either rural Hmong or some other obscure ethnic group. In other words, they know nothing about who our people are and, like the rest of the town, they honestly do not care.\"\"What about the nature of our traditons, Marie?

It had been entrusted to them by their village and, by the blessings of the Gods and their Instrument, they had kept it safe and hidden for more than twenty years. \"Father, it is not as if I wish to set up an alter on the stage, recite the incantations of the harvest rites and slice something open; frankly, I would have no idea how. However, I believe that there is a ritual that is benign, unusual and, even according to the author of this book, beautiful enough to make people forget its oddity.\" She opened the book, filled with sepia photographs and notes written in French on yellowed paper, to the page she had bookmarked. \"I want to do the Stork Dance.\"Her parents were quiet for a minute. Admittedly, this was probably the least unusual rite of their people and it did seem to have a calming effect on its audiences. However, it took weeks of intensive training in order to do it right, the costuming and specific actions depended on whether the dancer was a man or woman and the phonograph with the instrumental music and vocals, only having been recorded once before, was on the other side of the planet. It was a tall order to pull off for anyone. \"You do realize that practicing for the dance requires grueling routine, so much so that it might effect your school work?\" Asked her mother, wondering if her daughter was truly sincere.\"I know that. Ill just have to sacrifice my time with Joesph, a sacrifice that Im sure hed understand.\" Marie responded in English this time, the plans for her act becoming clearer. \"However, Ill need some help in creating the proper costuming and... I know that shipping items from the Old Country is like trying to smuggle Plutonium but if you could convince the shamans to release that phonograph for a month or two, I would be eternally grateful to all of them, and to you.\"Her parents wondered, not for the first time, if Marie truly comprehended what could be asked of that gratitude in the years to come. She had the opportunity to live a life completely detached from the paranoia, the fear and the constant danger that followed her people. Would she give that chance away simply for the sake of a boy?Whatever choice she made, however, was hers to make.In the end, they acquiesced... but not without informing their daughter of what their home village could ask of her in exchange for the items she wished. It might be years until it was asked but one day, a representative of their village would approach her and request a repayment, be it in money, information or something else.It was that \"something else\" that truly worried Thuch and Thanh.", "The Judas Mark\"Cthulhu ftaghn,\" He said with a laugh, swaying his tilted head to the right in a drunken manner. \"Cthulhu ftaghn.\"He broke out into a laughing fit. Then as quickly as it started it stopped; like the lightning bolt outside his window. Arkham was his place of work. And as a patient, his work was hard to complete. Not like he wanted to do it, either.The rain stopped.\"I hear youuuuuuu.\" He chuckled. \"I hear you flapping those blasted wings outside my windah.\" He giggled, then sobered up. \"Damn Migo. YA CANT HAVE MY BRAIN!\"There came a drum of plastic on metal as his attention was drawn to the orderly with a plastic flashlight. Aforementioned light shining into his padded room.\"Keep it down in there!\" The orderly snapped before leaving him alone once again.\"Power outage, eh?\" He chuckled. \"Wonder whyyyy.\"He rolled his head back to his right; towards his window. His eyes registered the sound of unearthly wings twitching like insects contemplating flight. Oh how he hated those damn things. Far worse than those Shoggoths he faced a while back. At least the Shoggoths ate you; thus ending your torment. But a Migo…He shuttered. He did not want to think about it.\"Nyarlahotep…You son of a bitch.\" He said, looking grumpy, then broke out in hysterics, then going back as if it never happened. \"If it werent for you…Id be…Id be…\"Where would he be? In his mind, he saw himself in Miami, laying on the beach with Lucinda, their two kids playing in the sand as the waves crashed soothingly onto the shore. But then his logic would kick that to the curb. Lucinda was showing signs…She would have dumped him if it werent for that Deep One, that is, dragging her-kicking and screaming-to the bottom of the sea.He would be away from his insane parents. That insane town of Dunwich. Even if Lucinda did not accompany him, he would, at least, be free from here. But then he met him.\"Jesus…\"\"Yes?\" Came a sweet, velvety voice. A voice one would hear from royalty.\"Not you.\" He snapped.\"But I am him.\" A hand placed itself on his shoulder as the entire figure appeared, sitting beside him like they were best friends.\"No...Youre the fucking antichrist.\"\"Is there really a difference in that either?\" Jesus asked, a smirk gracing his regal, black lips. \"Both promise paradise. From there, its on a persons opinion on what that is.\" He chuckled. \"And do not tell me that you forgot your title, Ivan…Or should I say Judas?\"\"THEN WHY PLACE ME HERE?\" Ivan shouted.\"Hey!\" The orderly shouted, banging his flashlight on the bars again. \"What did I just say?\"The orderlys face began to bubble. His flesh boiled, broken screams erupted from his face. He collapsed and scratched at his face, letting more and more blood poor onto the floor.\"I hate interruptions.\" Jesus said. \"And as for your answer…Because. If Jesus was as all powerful as he claimed, why did he allow Judas to stay in the fold? Why did he allow the lowly wretches hope? Why did I command Tython to drag Lucinda down to the depths to suffer being rendered by hungry maws before she could drown?\"He smirked evilly as he described Lucindas gruesome demise. Ivan panted heavily, his rage rising faster than Rlyeh ever would to the surface. Ivan struck thin air as his body moved too slow for the deity; whom was already standing, laughing at the mortal.\"Because theres more to it, Judas.\" Jesus said. \"Judas of old was an important player in the world. The wretches were a growing populace, if they loved him, they would worship him.\"\"Bullshit!\" He spat.\"Is it?\"\"We want you to betray us, Judas.\" Jesus said after his question was ignored.\"Why?\"\"Sorry, but us Christs keep some secrets from their disciples.\"\"What makes you Jesus?\"\"Our roles.\" He stated simply. \"You see…He was supposed to preach about us. But, sadly, his mind couldnt take it. So Cthulhu became a god. Not like it matters, religion changes all the time.\"He smirked, all knowing. \"And no, he wasnt the son of Cthulhu. That was my little trick.\"\"Pray Judas,\" He said from behind Ivan-not allowing him to speak-his black, decaying lips mere inches from his ear. \"He likes that. It makes him feel powerful.\"\"No,\" Ivan said. \"I shall not ya damned bastard! And I wont bring about their reawakening! These crazies will remain sedated!\"Jesus laughed.\"Thats my cue.\"Jesus grabbed Ivan by the neck and slammed his body against the wall. Buzzing from outside the window grew from a silent drone into a frenzy. Jesus smirked evilly, drawing his face closer to his Judas.\"In blood the mark is drawn.\"Nyarlahotep drew the blade he was hiding and slashed Ivans wrist, splattering drops of blood on the wall. He watched in delight as the drops spread, several linking up and continuing their intricate design.It consisted of a crude circle with intertwining tentacles and a pair of piercing eyes.\"There,\" He said. \"Done.\"He tossed Ivan. He landed next to the window and as he peered out of it he clearly saw the glowing heads and beating wings of the Migo, their forms slightly covered by the rain that began to fall again.\"Enjoy your trip, Judas.\" Nyarlahotep said. \"For though I am done with you, you still serve a purpose.\"The Migo swarmed, the window shattering like paper. Ivan barely had time to scream as they worked on his skull, amputating his brain and placing it inside their jar.\"Cthulhu ftagn, indeed.\""]}
{"id": "EN082", "pair": ["An autumnal chill descended upon the streets of Glaston as the young man walked upon the concrete sidewalk, passing redbrick storefronts and shop windows, every surface still wet with the morning rain. Leaves, red and orange and each vibrant in their hue, were shaken loose from the trees lining the street by the wind, landing wherever they fell. For an instant in time, the spectacle of the leaves drew the attention of the man, in fact little more than a teenage boy, as he made his way toward the corner. However, Joseph Clayton, clad in bluejeans and jacket with a backpack slung from his shoulders, had far more important things to focus on than a show of falling leaves. An important test for this semester was arriving in a week or so and he needed to study.Also, he was getting quite hungry this close to lunch.As Joseph rounded the corner and continued toward his favorite eatery, he wondered if he would get swamped in the usual lunch crowd. However, as he saw the front of the Leng Trinh Restaurant, his thoughts turned to quiet dejection.\"Damnit!\" muttered Joseph as he approached the eatery. The reason for this turn in mood was the carpet of tempered glass fragments on the sidewalk below the picture window at the front of the establishment, which was now covered by plastic sheeting. Thuch Van Trinh, one half of the husband-and-wife ownership, was wearing a plaid jacket over his apron and usual cooking clothes and was shoveling the broken glass into a bucket. \"Hey, Mr. Trinh, hows it going?\". Joseph asked with a smile. This was more false cheer than anything, as Joseph could guess how Thuch must be feeling: anger was always a popular choice, followed closely by worry about the reason why.Despite what he must have been feeling, Thuch Van Trinh grinned back, the black lines of his facial tattooing creasing as the muscles moved under his cheeks. \"Not so good, Mr. Clayton. If this keeps up, I may have to put in Plexiglas so that the window wont break.\" The Trinhs accents, as his parents and the other adults of the town told it, had been rather strong (even unusually so) when they had immigrated to Glaston from their first home in Boston. This had usually been waved off by their purported origins in the remote hills on the Vietnam-Laos border, seemingly collaborated by how their teeth had been dyed black. On the other hand, given their rural roots, their speed in adapting local speech patterns so that they now sounded more like second generation Americans (and especially their daughters complete lack of any accent except the local standard) did make for a puzzling situation. However, for their ease of assimilation and the food they served, they had become well-liked in the community.So why were things like this happening to them recently? \"How many times does this make this month; two, three?\" Joseph had to ask this, wondering if things were worse than he thought.\"Its happened three times already, this time not more than an hour ago. Thanh wants to install security cameras to watch the place and with how small and cheap they are now, I think we just might.\" An hour ago? Theyd smashed a picture window in broad daylight? Who in town could be that stupid or that angry? Josephs train of thought was broken then, when Thuch said something of much more interest to the younger man. \"By the way, if youre looking for Marie, shes helping her mother in the kitchen. Even without a window we seem to be doing good business.\" Thuch went back to his work and Joseph, not wanting to delay any longer, entered the restaurant.Just as Thuch had said, Leng Trinh still had its usual busy lunchtime crowd, albeit one that was concentrated near the back wall. Picking his way around tables packed with diners, Joseph finally arrived at a table set for two, a reserved sign upon it. Removing his backpack and laying it beside a chair, he sat down, shuffled off his coat and went to bury his nose in the menu.It always felt a bit odd to Joseph, eating in an ethnic restaurant where none of the diners were the same ethnicity as the cooks, or even from the same part of the world. However, none of it mattered when the food was as good as it was here.\"Now then, what would a fine, upstanding New England boy like yourself want in a place like this?\" The voice that asked this was soft, amused, female and had an almost mocking tone. It also had the accent of the New England uplands. To Joseph, it could only be one person.\"The same thing I always get here.\" He answered dryly before looking up from the menu. There, holding a pad of paper and a pen, was teenage girl with almond-shaped eyes, shoulder length black hair with green streaks, a cooking apron and an amused grin. \"Hi Marie... you sure your moms alright with you waitressing this crowd?\"\"Weve got enough help in the kitchen already and Dads coming in after all the glass is cleaned up.\" She glanced up at the window, plastic sheet and all, after she wrote his order down. \"I just wish we knew who was doing this. If we dont get someone else to cough up some money, our insurance company might go sour on us.\" Marie went back to the kitchen to get the food for both of them.Ten minutes later, she was laying out two place settings of food that had been prepared ahead of time. \"Alright, thats two plates of grilled pork on beds of Leng-style rice, your dish of steamed green beans with soy sauce for dipping, my bowl of soup and two cans of soda.\" Theyd eat lunch before studying, with Joseph paying the tab for both of them.If anyone asked, it wasnt a date. Not in the strictest sense, anyway.\"What, no bak bon dzhow?\" Asked Joseph, decidedly disappointed at the apparent lack of the special ingredient.To this, Marie moved a small earthen bowl from the serving tray onto the table and lifted the lid to reveal a thick gray sauce containing mushrooms and cracked black pepper. \"Would I be one to deny you the gravy of the gods?\" She asked (rhetorically) with a soft smile; Joseph couldnt help but smile back as he cracked the tab on his soda and began on his green beans.A bit later, when his beans were gone and Marie had almost finished her soup, Joesph began formulating a question that related to a curious thought that had sprung up earlier. \"Not to sound like a nag or anything, but Im just curious but what was all that upstanding stuff about?\" The only time he had ever heard anyone talk like that was...Oh God...Marie swallowed the last bits of her soup. \"Oh, I dont know. Maybe Its that I had no idea that the son of insurance brokers had such deep and aristocratic roots? Maybe its that I was surprised to find out that the Claytons had come not from hardy New England farming stock as I had assumed, but from the urbane, wealthy ranks of those grand Brahmins of Boston? Im sure Granny Cora could tell some fascinating stories about the old days; she sure seemed interested in mine.\" If anything, Marie took the entire thing in stride, treating both the memory of the experience and the experience itself with a a great deal of interested amusement. Certainly, mocking the type of language she had encountered was almost cracking her up.Joseph, on the other hand, had first felt bemusement at the scene in which the Clayton family reunion of the past summer had found itself, quickly turning into outright embarrassment. \"Look, Im sorry that I didnt tell you about her, but everybody thought that she wouldnt be able to come due to health concerns. Its not my fault that a half-senile, 97 year old woman worked up enough stubbornness to drag her nurse halfway across the state!\".\"I never said anything about anyone being at fault. I just thought it was an interesting revelation about your family.\" She had meant her cajoling in good humour, but Josephs defensiveness and embarrassment were never good emotions to bring out. \"Anyway, most people would be proud to have the Boston gentry in their family history: industrialists, merchants, art, culture, philanthropy, charity...\" With every word, Marie spooned a bit of ban boc dzhow onto her grilled pork.\"As well as whaling, slave trading, opium smuggling, snobbery and having your entire life guided by the expectations of your peers; exactly the sorts of things my parents taught me to loathe. The thing is, my great-great-grandmother came from a very select, very privileged and lily-white background; I was worried that shed... well, react oddly to you.\" Joseph retorted as he began spooning (or rather, pouring) the sauce onto his meat after Marie had finished with it and passed it to him. In the case of Cora Clayton (nee Coffin), Josephs fear hadnt primarily been that she would find Marie objectionable on account of her race since that prejudice had been more ingrained in her parents generation than hers. His fear had instead been that his great great grandmother, as self-proclaimed guardian of the old, aristocratic traditions, might object to their relationship because the Trinhs were restaurateurs with no history of pedigree, education or money behind them.In Coras world (the 1920s, where her mind was half the time), heirs had married heiresses, families had coordinated their fortunes and everyone had kept an eye on everyone else; these were rules of decorum that had lasted for her long after the Claytons had gone bust in the great Crash of 29. The fact that she had taken Joseph aside and explained her concerns to him had done nothing to soothe his embarrassment, although he had finally convinced her that, being naturalized citizens with a successful restaurant, the Trinhs were firmly in the middling classes. She had also estimated that said restaurant, with no other inheritors besides Marie, would most likely pass into Clayton hands in the fullness of time.No one had dared explain to her the differences between modern teenage dating and the genteel courtships of her youth.\"I dont think she reacted that oddly. Sure, she was so out of date that you had to explain that I meant French Indochina when I said that my parents came from Vietnam and she did seem a bit too fascinated with my families origins and, alright, it was weird hearing someone actually use the word courting without trying to be funny. However, it was kind of nice to speak French with someone in this town after all the time my parents invested in me learning it.\" Marie knew that while it had been terrifying for Joseph, having to put up with his relatives dissection of his relationship and fearing disapproval, she herself had enjoyed a chance to see if the old stereotypes were true. When it had become clear to Marie that the elderly woman was not about to spew racial epitaphs at her but was, indeed, fascinated as to her families background, Marie had made it a point to ham it up in telling their story.To an entranced Cora Clayton, Marie had described her parents lives before emigration as a subsistence existence in a village high up in the fog-choked mountain passes. She had woven scenes of her people worshiping strange, heathen gods far from the civilized lands of the Buddha and partaking in ghastly rituals to ensure harvests of rice from narrow mountainside terraces. She told the old woman that her parents had tired of such a life and had dreamed of something more, something in the wider world glimpsed in third-hand magazines and radio broadcasts.After receiving a dispensation from their village shaman to leave (but promising to sent back remittances), they had made their way to Hanoi and then to Boston and finally to Glaston where, having never truly given up the more religious and symbolic aspects of their heathenish past, they nevertheless had made good names for themselves in the community. Marie had made sure that her prose had been both lurid and exotic so as to fully entrance a child of the Age of Empire as well as making proper use of tone, whether enraptured, casual or deathly serious, to emphasize mood. The end result was to make it sound as if her culture wasnt just some rural outlet of modern Vietnam or Laos, but as if it was truly unlike any other in the world.That was an opinion that Joseph was also rapidly adopting.They ate in relative silence for a while, the bustle of the lunch crowd beginning to die down as people left, many of them stopping to talk to Mr. Trinh at the till, expressing their concern over what had happened with the window. They were just about half done when Joseph began another conversation. \"So, did you know that theres a Heritage Day coming up at school in a few weeks?\"\"Yeah, and?\" Deep down in her gut, Marie was beginning to get a slightly worried feeling from the direction this conversation was going. This pretty much happened whenever the subject of her parents past came up but, like so many times before, she could probably bluff her way through it.\"I thought that, maybe, we could do something for it. I was thinking about dredging up something from Normandy because I didnt want to clog up the schedule with another variation of British regional culture.\" It sounded perfectly innocent, but Marie knew that this was a potentially tricky situation that might require misdirection, a convincing excuse and possible outright lying.She hated lying to Joseph.\"Alright then. You can do that, Ill do the Vietnamese thing and well knock em all dead.\" She answered with an enthusiasm that she hoped had betrayed nothing of her growing unease with the conversation. This seemed to provoke nothing but a non-committal murmur of agreement and thus, thinking that that was over with, she began eating again.However, that was not the end of it.\"By Vietnamese, do you mean the standard culture from around Hanoi... or the culture from your parents home village?\" Joseph asked, seemingly as if only for the purpose of clarification. There was much more behind it though, and whether it was just ingrained paranoia or any real danger of exposure, Marie knew that this was entering onto some very tenuous and potentially very dangerous ground. Still, the subject had to be breached.\"Arent they pretty much the same? I mean, sure, it was pretty rural back there, but whether village or city, we were all Viet: same language, same culture, same blood, same... pretty much everything, when you think about it.\" As denials went, this one wasnt half bad: sincere enough to be taken seriously and with enough internal logic that it wouldnt fall apart immediately in the face of the mildly educated mind.On this subject, however, Joseph had become rather more than merely mildly educated. He had observed things for a long time: a lot of little things and one or two big things for the most part. And he, after long deliberation and study, had discovered that some of those things just didnt match up.\"You know, there was a time when I could believe that. But... there are just too many deviations to discount.\" Joesph stopped eating all together, putting down his fork and looking his girlfriend straight in the eyes before closing and opening them again, as if to rally his thoughts. \"The food, for one thing, isnt like any kind of Vietnamese food Ive read about. Yes, you have the side dishes but thats about it for similarity. Second, your parents tattoos. Again, unlike any other group in Southeast Asia; the closest matches I could find were incised lines on bronze figurines from over two thousand years ago.\"He stopped again. \"And then theres the language you guys speak. Im fairly sure its in the Mon-Khmer group, but Ive been doing some research and... honestly, Ive seen words on this menu that Ive never been able to find in any other source. And Im not the only one whos noticed these things.\" Joesph saw panic flash across Maries eyes, though she tried to hide it. \"Most people dont pay attention and honestly dont care, and the ones who do notice just assume that you guys are either Hmong or some little minority that no-ones ever heard of... but even that doesnt match very well either. Its like you said, youre Viet... but what about all this other stuff?\"It was then that Marie could have ended it all: the doubts, the questions, the lingering curiosity... as well as twenty one centuries of secrecy, tradition and very likely her relationship with this young man. In the end, she decided to dodge again. \"What can I say? We were very rural.\" When Joesph just got this frustrated look on his face, Marie sighed, reached across the table and enveloped one of his hands with hers. \"Look, Ill try and dredge something up if I can, but I cant promise anything, okay?\"Joseph mulled on this lack of answers, but as the moment dragged on, his resistance wore down. \"Alright. If you dont want to talk about your culture, thats alright; lots of people come to America to get away from stuff. But I still am sorta curious.\" Then he changed the subject. \"Anyway, after we eat, we should begin studying for our tests. Do you want to go over the English or the Algebra first?\"\"We should do the Math first, then we can cool off with the Shakespeare. But we better not let the food get cold, what with how the sauce gets if allowed to sit for too long.\" Marie began eating again and, after a few beats, Joseph resumed as well.They stayed at that table for many hours, going over and revising their knowledge of maths and literature. However, already Marie wondered if there was something she could reveal, something that she could show about her parents culture that would not threaten expose them and, as the old saying went among her tribe, get them cut in half and buried in two graves.Later that night, The Trinhs upstairs apartmentTo Maries relief, her parents reaction to her plan wasnt anger. On the other hand, fear and worry could be almost as painful.\"I know how you feel about the Clayton boy. Hes well-liked, intelligent and his parents are our insurance agents.\" Thanh Thi Trinh began, speaking in her families particular dialect of Viet as she, Marie and Thuch Van sat around their dining room table. \"But I ask this of you: is Joesph and his interest in this celebration worth the risk of exposure and, may I add, possible death when this town realizes who we are, when they realize what we are?\" Thanh Thi had always been the more reserved, more cautious and, frankly, more paranoid spouse in this family when it came to their safety. Where her husband was the face of the restaurant, she ran the kitchen with an eye on the back door and all of their cooks. While Thuch made friendly at social gatherings, Thanh kept track of all possible escape routes and who was and wasnt looking at them. She kept track of any news about gangs and hate-group activity in the area, and about any other strange things.The sort of things that might lure out the kind of people who hunted their people.But Marie had prepared for this. \"Mother, I know the risks that revealing the secrets of our people would bring. However, I am counting on two circumstances to make sure that only the most benign and harmless information is portrayed.\" She rallied herself, knowing that the way she handled this could make the difference on how she presented herself to nearly everyone, especially Joseph . \"First, I must inform both of you that there are some people in this town, including my boyfriend, that realize that we are not quite from the mainstream culture of modern Vietnam.\" At this, both Thanh and Thuch got even more worried but they werent shocked, seeing as any bumpkin with an Internet connection could find that tribal tattooing wasnt really the rage in downtown Hanoi. \"The good news is that while these people realize that we belong to a distinct subgroup, they often deduce that we are either rural Hmong or some other obscure ethnic group. In other words, they know nothing about who our people are and, like the rest of the town, they honestly do not care.\"\"What about the nature of our traditons, Marie? What would you do, what rite of our people would be performed on that stage that would not end up with half the town vomiting and the other half trying to hang us?\" Her father had been relatively quiet in this conversation, but he knew that the rituals of his village had, during various times in history, left such a bad impression upon outsiders that they had responded in force to try to stamp them out.Here, Marie began grasping the thick, heavy and old scrapbook that lay closed upon the table before her. It had been entrusted to them by their village and, by the blessings of the Gods and their Instrument, they had kept it safe and hidden for more than twenty years. \"Father, it is not as if I wish to set up an alter on the stage, recite the incantations of the harvest rites and slice something open; frankly, I would have no idea how.

It was a tall order to pull off for anyone. \"You do realize that practicing for the dance requires grueling routine, so much so that it might effect your school work?\" Asked her mother, wondering if her daughter was truly sincere.\"I know that.

It might be years until it was asked but one day, a representative of their village would approach her and request a repayment, be it in money, information or something else.It was that \"something else\" that truly worried Thuch and Thanh.", "Spoonbill Village, Northernmost Quang Binh Province, SRVJune 30, 2011.Dreaming of the past was no strange thing for Joseph Clayton over the past year. Before yesterday, the memory had been of his and Maries last farewell, when she had told him that she was traveling to Vietnam for a one-year \"hiatus\" of sorts. Now, the memory of which he dreamed was of the occasion of Maries 18th birthday, some months before she had informed him of her imminent departure. There had been food and gifts from their few friends in the community and, despite the national legal drinking age of 21, Marie was invited by her parents to sample one of the traditional medicinal liquors or Ruou Thuocs of their native village, specifically a distilled rice whiskey of 100 proof in which had soaked a section of beef bone.Also that night, despite her parents usual diligence, things between Joseph Clayton and Marie had become rather... heated. Just as the dream began to verge into the more pleasurable parts of the experience, a sound woke him quite suddenly. The noise, a sort of odd, whooshing crack...Gunfire?!Leaping out of his bed in a panic, Joseph landed face first in very nearly the same place where he had sat last night at dinner. Finally looking up after peeling his cheek off the floor, he saw that with the exception of himself and the normal women of the household (namely Marie, her Aunt and paternal Grandmother), the house was now empty. He had landed in the central depression which housed the table, seating mats and hearth and that was surrounded by the raised platforms where the party and those inhabiting the house had bedded down last night. \"What is that?!\" Asked Joseph as another volley of cracks sounded, now followed audibly by a command to reload.Although the question was general, the response he got was specific. \"If you mean the gunshots, those are the men doing some target practice.\" Marie replied as she made to spoon some broth into a bronze bowl.\"Strange, those guys who brought us in didnt look like the type to actually use guns, what with the whole \"barbarian\" vibe they were giving off.\" Joseph sat properly at his seat as his girlfriend brought him what turned out to be soup of the kind that she usually favored as an appetizer. After thanking her, he began eating.\"Trust me, the hunters and warriors dont even like to look at firearms; they think theyre a demeaning farce of a weapon, farmers weapons as they call them... but given that theyre used by the farming men, its a pretty accurate description.\" Ladling soup into her own bowl, she sat down beside Joseph at the table.As the two older women looked on from their own work, the small talk went on between the two young ones: it turned out that these guns were old French repeating rifles from the 1920s rather than a modern Kalashnikov derivative and used an obscure 8mm cartridge that had to be produced by their agents in Vinh.Then Joseph noticed something else. \"You know, I just noticed something about your teeth... theyre white.\"\"Of course they are. I know it may be a bit hard to find toothpaste out here but...\" It was then that Marie caught on to what he had meant. \"Oh, I guess you want to know why I havent dyed them black yet, huh?\" After Joseph nodded, Marie laid out, at the most basic level, what she wanted to take away from this trip. \"Well, Ive accepted lots of conditions for this visit. I did the tattooing, I help in the rice paddies, Ive gone without modern clothing in almost every fashion, but these babies...\" She paused, did a tooth-bearing rictus grin and tapped her incisors with her right index fingernail three times. \"Ive worked far too long for this shade and Im not going to sacrifice them just so I can chew Betel nuts as a stimulant. Luckily, Dao managed to wrangle a small coffee supply from the Party minders; for a head priest hes not too bad, especially at this time of the morning.\"Somehow, Joseph suspected that this refusal had less to do with cosmetic concerns and more to do with her determination to not turn into a clone of her mother (in all of her paranoid glory) but something else caught his attention. \"What time is it, exactly? And where is everyone?\" Joseph asked in between bites. Everyone (including his party and Maries family members) had bedded down last night when the night grew dark and they had run out of things to do to stave off exhaustion. That they werent here now...Marie had an air of subtle amusement about her, possessed since untying Joseph last night. \"We dont really keep time as an exact science around here. We have morning, evening, dawn, dusk, a rough idea of mid-day... and not much else. Even the passing of the seasons tends to become a blur in the constant raining and mist; without a calendar, time can play tricks on a person up here.\"Her boyfriend did not exactly believe this. \"You dont have any clocks? I mean... National Geographic even had to edit an alarm clock out of one of their photos in order to make an African hut look primitive enough!\"Having never heard of this before, Marie could only shake her head in a form of self-depreciating humor. \"Its like I said once: this place is very rural and has historically been very isolated; it used to take years for news to filter up here from the coast. As to your other question, although Im unaware of the exact local time, your friends left the house about an hour ago.\" At this news, Joseph made a move to get up and join his friends (luckily, he had slept in his clothes) but was quickly (and effectively) shoved back down into his seat and told to finish his soup.According to Marie, the kids had gone up onto the northern terraces with Tracy to show her the rice paddies (as she was ostensibly a farmer like they) while Albert had gone to retrieve their electronic equipment from the watermill where a small water-powered electric generator had been installed by the Border Defense force just a few years before. As to the Prof and his assistant... apparently, thered been a meeting between some of the village bigwigs last night after the negotiations in the temple and Andover wanted to make sure that all the bad blood, anger and other annoyances had been cleared up before fieldwork was to commence.As a small aside however, Marie did note that the powder of the Blue Forest Lotus did seem to have a slight lingering effect on those... yet unaccustomed to the strangeness that was apparently all too common in the world. Since Andover, Malone, Tracy and Albert had come from experiences where the paranormal was slightly less para-, they had arisen early, eaten and left without any signs of sloth.After they finished eating, they returned their bowls to the hearth, thanked the two women and then left to join Josephs fellows who were set to gather in the temple for a meeting with Tsan Pho Dao himself.The way that they had left while holding hands, however, told Maries aunt and grandmother that the village matchmaker might be about to encounter another problem regarding Marie... or at the very least, the root of her current problems involving Marie.Approximately 20 Minutes LaterAs two acolytes opened the great double doors of the temple from the inside, Joseph could only gape in awe at the sights before him. The transition from the world outside with its bright sunlight and high humidity to the world of faintly lit darkness and incense smoke that contained itself within the temple of Spoonbill Village was.. almost magical. Given what he had already heard of, this might not just be a laymans impression.The interior of the temple also gave the impression of a sort of duality: on one hand, this building was probably the safest place in the village. On the other hand, the very atmosphere exuded by their surroundings, with acolytes working at mysterious duties before the various shrines of dark stone that lined the walls, indicated to any visitor that they just may not leave this building alive, an indication only strengthened by a large block of dark stone at the rear third of the interior. The sides of this almost altar-esqe block of Jadeite were engraved with many characters which appeared to be a bizarre mixture of Khoa Dau (the old script of Vietnam), the curving loops of Javanese and something even odder and older, resembling some of Alberts research on the old Seal Scripts of the Zhou... but not quite. The top of the block was formed into a shallow basin with notches for something of a liquid nature to run down into a series of channels (and from the look of it, recently had). The basin was large enough to hold a buffalo of considerable size and probably had many times over the years.According to what Marie had told him, it could also hold an adult Human male.Before the stone was low table on which was spread a yellow silken cloth. Upon the cloth, several strange items in ivory, jade, various metals and wood were placed, all seemingly used for the purpose of divining. However, what was most interesting about the table were the figures which were sitting behind it.The first and more distinctive figure was that of an old man in an ornate gold headdress and voluminous red robes. While allegedly in his early 70s and not nearly as old as some people he had met, Joseph could see that something had wizened his features to the point where he appeared decades older than he should. What hair could be seen was wispy and white, being contained mostly in a braided beard and a mustache that looked like it might have belonged on Fu Manchu if said character had survived to the age of 126. The mans eyes, however, were clear and bright, and his face held signs of amusement under the formal grimace; Later, Joseph would identify said amusement as the product of the old, sing-song adage of \"I Know Something You Dont Know\".But not yet.Professor Andover, at the head of the party that included his students and Marie, led them to a point just before the low table and motioned them to kneel and bow. When they all knelt, Andover finally spoke in the most reverent tone that Joseph had ever heard applied to this or any other form of Mon-Khmer. \"In the spirit of respect and friendship I greet you, Tsan Pho Dao, Oracle of the Jade Bones, Sage of the Blood and Master of the Way of Leng.\"Seemingly placated by the proper formal greeting, Tsan Pho Dao answered back.. but not in the way that everyone was expecting him to.\"And in the spirit of Peace and Hospitality I greet you, Professor Neville Andover of Miskatonic University.\" Replied the Chief Priest... in perfect, unaccented English. As a few heads raised and eyes gazed at him in surprise, the Priest shrugged and offered an explanation. \"A Language Acquisition Spell: sacrifice a pig and the world opens up to you. Now, I believe that you were to explain the purpose of this visit, were you not?\"Recovering remarkably well, Neville Andover explained exactly what he wanted to come out of this short, hopefully first survey. As the professor laid out the intricacies of the ethnographic process including both \"emic\" and \"etic\" (subject and researcher-derived, respectively) observations of daily life and material culture, interviews, historical research and recording of various events, Joseph slowly became aware of something. The first thing he noticed was that Maries left hand, still held and being held by his right hand as they sat next to each other, was exerting a steady pressure that was much increased from when they were walking toward the temple or entering it. He also found that she was looking sideways towards the second figure near the altar stone,This figure was a woman, somewhere between 60 and 70 years of age and rather less weathered than the man she sat beside and slightly to the rear of, her facial tattoos an asymmetric collection of delicate swirls and tiny trapezoids. Dressed in a fine formal gown of red and dark blue silk with gold filigree, she wore many sorts of jewelry from combs in her gray hair to bracelets of jade and gold on her wrists and even pendants and beads dangling from the ends of the jade hairpins that seemed to be ubiquitous in the hairstyles of married women in this village. Whereas this woman wore an expression of serene indifference, the look what Marie was giving her could easily be described as \"stink-eye\". While Joseph had been privy to a very mild version of this expression when he had almost implied cannibalism on the menu of her parents restaurant, the last time he had witnessed the full force of such a look was when they were in the fifth grade and a classmate had the gall to insult her parents tattoos.\"And Albert Noyes.. you know of the Whisperers? The mushrooms of Yuggoth?\" Tsan Pho Dao asked, examining the oracular bauble on the table which apparently indicated Noyes background. Josephs attention was brought back to the conversation by this question and the affirmative answer from Albert. \"Tell me then...\" Asked Dao. \"Have you encountered the Bringer of Strange Joy?\"\"Not face to face and neither have any others in my town. Ive heard of it... but almost as a legend across space and dimensions.\" Albert shrugged. \"I still dont understand what it really is.\"\"Nobody ever truly does.\" Dao replied sagely before moving onto the next token. Upon picking up and examining a piece of carved buffalo horn, his eyes flickered to Ms. Williams. \"It seems that you share something with our people, Ms. Williams. The bones indicate that you have participated in the rites of sacrifice, much as we do?\"\"Yes, but like Ive said before, weve only ever sacrificed our own livestock. I once helped to hold down a pig, alright but... I dont know, we never wanted to kill people and we never needed to. Some of the other groups we keep running into, though...\" Tracy sighed after she realized that she had almost began rambling. \"We try so hard to keep all of the weirdos in line year after year... and year after year its always the same: some crazy bastard tries to sneak in a human sacrifice, we get pissed and threaten to call the cops, they try to blackmail us into allowing it and then the saner worshipers just take the intended victim back where they came from, none the wiser on where they were. I just worry that someday, something horrible will happen on our doorstep and that well be blamed while the assholes slink off into the woods.\" She then looked up at the Chief Sorcerer in embarrassment. \"Im sorry that you had to hear that.. and sorry about the \"crazy bastard\" crack. Im sure youre a very nice person.\"Affecting a look of near-pity, Tsan Pho Dao offered a little of what he had seen in her future. \"The stress of such a life can be hard to bear... but I sense that help has already held out a hand. All that remains is for someone to be brave enough to accept it.\" As Tracy thought this bit of fortune-cookie wisdom over, the priest turned his head towards Joseph, who opened his mouth to speak. However, Dao held up two claw-like fingers to stop him. \"We know of you, Joseph Clayton and as of yet, nothing much outside the norm have you gazed. However, I would appreciate hearing the reasons on why you ceased playing your sport when you ventured away from home.\"Already prepared for such clarity of soothsaying, the young man shrugged. \"It turns out that I wasnt tall enough to play college basketball. However, even if I had been.. I dont I would have been content to play for a team which called itself the, and I quote, Mommas Boys.\" Albert groaned in embarrassment at the name while Tracy found reason to snicker, both knowing that the Miskatonic \"MBs\" were a long-time running punchline for the college leagues.With that interlude over, assignments were made. Tracy, coming from farm country, would stay with Maries Grandparents, conduct interviews among the farmers and record their daily lives, up to and including working alongside them on the terraced rice paddies. Albert, displaying more aptitude with technology due to his communities alliance with the so-called \"Migo\", would be stationed at the household of the Village Bronze-caster, who supplied many of the tools and utensils of the village. As they were also one of the most socially connected families in the village, the large house they inhabited would make an ideal central base for the expedition.Malone, as he had existing skills and reputedly the strongest stomach, would cover the operation of the Temple and thus be overseen by Professor Andover, who would be staying there as well. As for Joseph... for Joseph, it was decided, quite surprisingly, that he would live in the house of the hunters that had encountered the party.As the guests rose and began filing out, Tsan Pho Dao watched the retreating figures intently until the door closed behind them. He turned to the woman sitting beside him. \"Well, that certainly explains why the girl has rebuffed all of the potential suitors you pushed her way.\"The womans mask of indifference gave way to shock and then the stirrings of anger. \"You mean... him?! Are you saying that she, of her own accord, chose some foreign devil instead of one of her own kind?\"\"I wouldnt be that harsh on the boy. Hes appears not of the same fragile, treacherous mindset as the others we have encountered... if his having come this far without screaming is any indication.\" Since this morning, Dao had know that something like this was coming; his wife was comfortable in both her power and her confidence in her decisions and a conflict was bound to happen given the way Thuch and Thanh had raised their daughter in the West.\"You know what I mean! It was bad enough that her parents gave her a French name and now shes been consorting with one of them as well!\"Dao sardonically smiled. \"Im fairly sure that the boy is English; they and the French have the kind of mutual dislike for each other that we and the Han do. As to the boy himself, Ive put him far away from where Marie is staying, but she still will have to act as an interpreter for the group.\" He picked up a small, silvery disc from the table and began to examine it. \"But given her confidence in him, I feel that we should observe what happens before making any moves.\"The woman, known now only by her title of Matchmaker and by a few in her past by the name of Chau, looked at her husband in an appraising way. \"You know something, dont you?\"Still gazing at the disc that had told him something of the Clayton boy, a Unites States quarter-dollar coin circa 1961, Dao chose his words carefully. \"What I know is dwarfed by what I suspect. But... what I do know is that there is something about this boy... something that you may have to take into consideration. The threads of his fate show that something is about to pull at them... but whether for good or ill or who will pull, I do not know.\"He did not know but, as his gaze lifted from the coin (specifically a series of scratches upon the face of Washington) towards a winding pattern of black fretwork above the main door, he suspected that whatever may be coming toward the boy would be very familiar indeed.Spoonbill Village, Early AfternoonJune 30, 2011.As part of his integration into the community, Joseph had acquiesced into wearing the local clothing: a kilt and short sleeved jacket in brown cotton with geometric patterns of black lines and dots.However, there was one piece of clothing that the young man was already beginning to miss.\"You mean everyone goes commando around here? Couldnt I have at least kept my boxers on?\" Having never dressed this way outside his regular use of towel or robe for showering, Joseph was having a bit of trouble getting used to it.\"Yes we do and no, you cant have your shorts back; those things absolutely stunk! Heavens know what was going on in there.\" As they made their way from her grandparents house to their destination, materials and devices at hand, they were drawing a fair amount of stares from people going about their business, most of them absolutely bewildered by the conversation that was going on. However, Joseph could have imagined that in that last statement there was some... not amusement, although Maries tone since he had gotten his head off the metaphorical chopping block indicated that she was much more at ease in this place than he was. But there had been a hint of suggestion, a certain playfulness of tone that suggested that she knew full well some of the things which had gone on in those shorts.And then he connected the \"going commando\" remark with... Oh dear. \"And you..?\" Joseph began, quite unsure on how to word the question.\"Ive kept that part of my dignity, thank you very much.\" There was a sense of arrogance and snootiness in Maries reply, but it was a false arrogance and a playful, imitation snootiness at heart. \"Alright, so I cheated a bit but there are things I want to hang onto, even if leaving here becomes... difficult.\" They stopped in front of a house near the entrance to the village temple.\"Anything I should know about this guy?\" Joseph asked his girlfriend, desperate to get his mind out of the gutter.\"First, hes a hunter, archer and scout. Hes from the Clan of the Spider, which is one of the really old warrior lineages in this village. Second, hes also got a wife who came from a village in Laos, a Tai speaker, so there may be a language barrier. They have a son in the age range of my younger cousins. Third... well, many of the warriors do a little sorcery on the side. The odd... mutation occasionally pops up.\" There was again an awkwardness, as she was apparently describing another bit of weirdness that had slipped past the descriptions of last night.Absorbing this new description and momentarily deciding that his libido was a somewhat more comfortable avenue, Joseph mustered courage and.. well, kissed Marie again. \"I love you and... and I promise that if this goes bad, Ill make sure you get out of here.\" This statement was supposed to be one of affirmation but the worry also showed through.Momentarily flustered by her boyfriends brashness, Marie nevertheless recovered quickly. \"Hey, if things go bad, Ill be the one dragging you out of here...\" Here, her tone turned softer, more grateful and more genuine. \"But thanks all the same.\" Everything said, that kind of commitment was nice to have reinforced, even if it did point to some creeping uneasiness with the whole thing.Still, it was only the second day.As she went up to the door, Joseph thought that it was probably a good thing that he would not be able to watch her leave... and it was probably also a good thing that neither the mens nor the womens kilts were very snug.If he wasnt careful, this was going to turn into a very embarrassing few weeks."]}

A Result and a Prologue1.From a private hospital for the insane near Providence, Rhode Island, there recently disappeared an exceedingly singular person. He bore the name of Charles Dexter Ward, and was placed under restraint most reluctantly by the grieving father who had watched his aberration grow from a mere eccentricity to a dark mania involving both a possibility of murderous tendencies and a profound and peculiar change in the apparent contents of his mind. Doctors confess themselves quite baffled by his case, since it presented oddities of a general physiological as well as psychological character.      In the first place, the patient seemed oddly older than his twenty-six years would warrant. Mental disturbance, it is true, will age one rapidly; but the face of this young man had taken on a subtle cast which only the very aged normally acquire. In the second place, his organic processes shewed a certain queerness of proportion which nothing in medical experience can parallel. Respiration and heart action had a baffling lack of symmetry; the voice was lost, so that no sounds above a whisper were possible; digestion was incredibly prolonged and minimised, and neural reactions to standard stimuli bore no relation at all to anything heretofore recorded, either normal or pathological. The skin had a morbid chill and dryness, and the cellular structure of the tissue seemed exaggeratedly coarse and loosely knit. Even a large olive birthmark on the right hip had disappeared, whilst there had formed on the chest a very peculiar mole or blackish spot of which no trace existed before. In general, all physicians agree that in Ward the processes of metabolism had become retarded to a degree beyond precedent.      Psychologically, too, Charles Ward was unique. His madness held no affinity to any sort recorded in even the latest and most exhaustive of treatises, and was conjoined to a mental force which would have made him a genius or a leader had it not been twisted into strange and grotesque forms. Dr. Willett, who was Wards family physician, affirms that the patients gross mental capacity, as gauged by his response to matters outside the sphere of his insanity, had actually increased since the seizure. Ward, it is true, was always a scholar and an antiquarian; but even his most brilliant early work did not shew the prodigious grasp and insight displayed during his last examinations by the alienists. It was, indeed, a difficult matter to obtain a legal commitment to the hospital, so powerful and lucid did the youths mind seem; and only on the evidence of others, and on the strength of many abnormal gaps in his stock of information as distinguished from his intelligence, was he finally placed in confinement. To the very moment of his vanishment he was an omnivorous reader and as great a conversationalist as his poor voice permitted; and shrewd observers, failing to foresee his escape, freely predicted that he would not be long in gaining his discharge from custody.      Only Dr. Willett, who brought Charles Ward into the world and had watched his growth of body and mind ever since, seemed frightened at the thought of his future freedom. He had had a terrible experience and had made a terrible discovery which he dared not reveal to his sceptical colleagues. Willett, indeed, presents a minor mystery all his own in his connexion with the case. He was the last to see the patient before his flight, and emerged from that final conversation in a state of mixed horror and relief which several recalled when Wards escape became known three hours later. That escape itself is one of the unsolved wonders of Dr. Waites hospital. A window open above a sheer drop of sixty feet could hardly explain it, yet after that talk with Willett the youth was undeniably gone. Willett himself has no public explanations to offer, though he seems strangely easier in mind than before the escape. Many, indeed, feel that he would like to say more if he thought any considerable number would believe him. He had found Ward in his room, but shortly after his departure the attendants knocked in vain. When they opened the door the patient was not there, and all they found was the open window with a chill April breeze blowing in a cloud of fine bluish-grey dust that almost choked them. True, the dogs howled some time before; but that was while Willett was still present, and they had caught nothing and shewn no disturbance later on. Wards father was told at once over the telephone, but he seemed more saddened than surprised. By the time Dr. Waite called in person, Dr. Willett had been talking with him, and both disavowed any knowledge or complicity in the escape. Only from certain closely confidential friends of Willett and the senior Ward have any clues been gained, and even these are too wildly fantastic for general credence. The one fact which remains is that up to the present time no trace of the missing madman has been unearthed.      Charles Ward was an antiquarian from infancy, no doubt gaining his taste from the venerable town around him, and from the relics of the past which filled every corner of his parents old mansion in Prospect Street on the crest of the hill. With the years his devotion to ancient things increased; so that history, genealogy, and the study of colonial architecture, furniture, and craftsmanship at length crowded everything else from his sphere of interests. These tastes are important to remember in considering his madness; for although they do not form its absolute nucleus, they play a prominent part in its superficial form. The gaps of information which the alienists noticed were all related to modern matters, and were invariably offset by a correspondingly excessive though outwardly concealed knowledge of bygone matters as brought out by adroit questioning; so that one would have fancied the patient literally transferred to a former age through some obscure sort of auto-hypnosis. The odd thing was that Ward seemed no longer interested in the antiquities he knew so well. He had, it appears, lost his regard for them through sheer familiarity; and all his final efforts were obviously bent toward mastering those common facts of the modern world which had been so totally and unmistakably expunged from his brain. That this wholesale deletion had occurred, he did his best to hide; but it was clear to all who watched him that his whole programme of reading and conversation was determined by a frantic wish to imbibe such knowledge of his own life and of the ordinary practical and cultural background of the twentieth century as ought to have been his by virtue of his birth in 1902 and his education in the schools of our own time. Alienists are now wondering how, in view of his vitally impaired range of data, the escaped patient manages to cope with the complicated world of today; the dominant opinion being that he is lying low in some humble and unexacting position till his stock of modern information can be brought up to the normal.      The beginning of Wards madness is a matter of dispute among alienists. Dr. Lyman, the eminent Boston authority, places it in 1919 or 1920, during the boys last year at the Moses Brown School, when he suddenly turned from the study of the past to the study of the occult, and refused to qualify for college on the ground that he had individual researches of much greater importance to make. This is certainly borne out by Wards altered habits at the time, especially by his continual search through town records and among old burying-grounds for a certain grave dug in 1771; the grave of an ancestor named Joseph Curwen, some of whose papers he professed to have found behind the panelling of a very old house in Olney Court, on Stampers Hill, which Curwen was known to have built and occupied. It is, broadly speaking, undeniable that the winter of 1919-20 saw a great change in Ward; whereby he abruptly stopped his general antiquarian pursuits and embarked on a desperate delving into occult subjects both at home and abroad, varied only by this strangely persistent search for his forefathers grave.      From this opinion, however, Dr. Willett substantially dissents; basing his verdict on his close and continuous knowledge of the patient, and on certain frightful investigations and discoveries which he made toward the last. Those investigations and discoveries have left their mark upon him; so that his voice trembles when he tells them, and his hand trembles when he tries to write of them. Willett admits that the change of 1919-20 would ordinarily appear to mark the beginning of a progressive decadence which culminated in the horrible and uncanny alienation of 1928; but believes from personal observation that a finer distinction must be made. Granting freely that the boy was always ill-balanced temperamentally, and prone to be unduly susceptible and enthusiastic in his responses to phenomena around him, he refuses to concede that the early alteration marked the actual passage from sanity to madness; crediting instead Wards own statement that he had discovered or rediscovered something whose effect on human thought was likely to be marvellous and profound. The true madness, he is certain, came with a later change; after the Curwen portrait and the ancient papers had been unearthed; after a trip to strange foreign places had been made, and some terrible invocations chanted under strange and secret circumstances; after certain answers to these invocations had been plainly indicated, and a frantic letter penned under agonising and inexplicable conditions; after the wave of vampirism and the ominous Pawtuxet gossip; and after the patients memory commenced to exclude contemporary images whilst his voice failed and his physical aspect underwent the subtle modification so many subsequently noticed.      It was only about this time, Willett points out with much acuteness, that the nightmare qualities became indubitably linked with Ward; and the doctor feels shudderingly sure that enough solid evidence exists to sustain the youths claim regarding his crucial discovery. In the first place, two workmen of high intelligence saw Joseph Curwens ancient papers found. Secondly, the boy once shewed Dr. Willett those papers and a page of the Curwen diary, and each of the documents had every appearance of genuineness. The hole where Ward claimed to have found them was long a visible reality, and Willett had a very convincing final glimpse of them in surroundings which can scarcely be believed and can never perhaps be proved. Then there were the mysteries and coincidences of the Orne and Hutchinson letters, and the problem of the Curwen penmanship and of what the detectives brought to light about Dr. Allen; these things, and the terrible message in mediaeval minuscules found in Willetts pocket when he gained consciousness after his shocking experience.      And most conclusive of all, there are the two hideous results which the doctor obtained from a certain pair of formulae during his final investigations; results which virtually proved the authenticity of the papers and of their monstrous implications at the same time that those papers were borne forever from human knowledge.2.      One must look back at Charles Wards earlier life as at something belonging as much to the past as the antiquities he loved so keenly. In the autumn of 1918, and with a considerable show of zest in the military training of the period, he had begun his junior year at the Moses Brown School, which lies very near his home. The old main building, erected in 1819, had always charmed his youthful antiquarian sense; and the spacious park in which the academy is set appealed to his sharp eye for landscape. His social activities were few; and his hours were spent mainly at home, in rambling walks, in his classes and drills, and in pursuit of antiquarian and genealogical data at the City Hall, the State House, the Public Library, the Athenaeum, the Historical Society, the John Carter Brown and John Hay Libraries of Brown University, and the newly opened Shepley Library in Benefit Street. One may picture him yet as he was in those days; tall, slim, and blond, with studious eyes and a slight stoop, dressed somewhat carelessly, and giving a dominant impression of harmless awkwardness rather than attractiveness.      His walks were always adventures in antiquity, during which he managed to recapture from the myriad relics of a glamorous old city a vivid and connected picture of the centuries before. His home was a great Georgian mansion atop the well-nigh precipitous hill that rises just east of the river; and from the rear windows of its rambling wings he could look dizzily out over all the clustered spires, domes, roofs, and skyscraper summits of the lower town to the purple hills of the countryside beyond. Here he was born, and from the lovely classic porch of the double-bayed brick facade his nurse had first wheeled him in his carriage; past the little white farmhouse of two hundred years before that the town had long ago overtaken, and on toward the stately colleges along the shady, sumptuous street, whose old square brick mansions and smaller wooden houses with narrow, heavy-columned Doric porches dreamed solid and exclusive amidst their generous yards and gardens.      He had been wheeled, too, along sleepy Congdon Street, one tier lower down on the steep hill, and with all its eastern homes on high terraces. The small wooden houses averaged a greater age here, for it was up this hill that the growing town had climbed; and in these rides he had imbibed something of the colour of a quaint colonial village. The nurse used to stop and sit on the benches of Prospect Terrace to chat with policemen; and one of the childs first memories was of the great westward sea of hazy roofs and domes and steeples and far hills which he saw one winter afternoon from that great railed embankment, all violet and mystic against a fevered, apocalyptic sunset of reds and golds and purples and curious greens. The vast marble dome of the State House stood out in massive silhouette, its crowning statue haloed fantastically by a break in one of the tinted stratus clouds that barred the flaming sky.      When he was larger his famous walks began; first with his impatiently dragged nurse, and then alone in dreamy meditation. Farther and farther down that almost perpendicular hill he would venture, each time reaching older and quainter levels of the ancient city. He would hesitate gingerly down vertical Jenckes Street with its bank walls and colonial gables to the shady Benefit Street corner, where before him was a wooden antique with an Ionic-pilastered pair of doorways, and beside him a prehistoric gambrel-roofer with a bit of primal farmyard remaining, and the great Judge Durfee house with its fallen vestiges of Georgian grandeur. It was getting to be a slum here; but the titan elms cast a restoring shadow over the place, and the boy used to stroll south past the long lines of the pre-Revolutionary homes with their great central chimneys and classic portals. On the eastern side they were set high over basements with railed double flights of stone steps, and the young Charles could picture them as they were when the street was new, and red heels and periwigs set off the painted pediments whose signs of wear were now becoming so visible.      Westward the hill dropped almost as steeply as above, down to the old \"Town Street\" that the founders had laid out at the rivers edge in 1636. Here ran innumerable little lanes with leaning, huddled houses of immense antiquity; and fascinated though he was, it was long before he dared to thread their archaic verticality for fear they would turn out a dream or a gateway to unknown terrors. He found it much less formidable to continue along Benefit Street past the iron fence of St. Johns hidden churchyard and the rear of the 1761 Colony House and the mouldering bulk of the Golden Ball Inn where Washington stopped. At Meeting Street - the successive Gaol Lane and King Street of other periods - he would look upward to the east and see the arched flight of steps to which the highway had to resort in climbing the slope, and downward to the west, glimpsing the old brick colonial schoolhouse that smiles across the road at the ancient Sign of Shakespears Head where the Providence Gazette and Country-Journal was printed before the Revolution. Then came the exquisite First Baptist Church of 1775, luxurious with its matchless Gibbs steeple, and the Georgian roofs and cupolas hovering by. Here and to the southward the neighbourhood became better, flowering at last into a marvellous group of early mansions; but still the little ancient lanes led off down the precipice to the west, spectral in their many-gabled archaism and dipping to a riot of iridescent decay where the wicked old waterfront recalls its proud East India days amidst polyglot vice and squalor, rotting wharves, and blear-eyed ship-chandleries, with such surviving alley names as Packet, Bullion, Gold, Silver, Coin, Doubloon, Sovereign, Guilder, Dollar, Dime, and Cent.      Sometimes, as he grew taller and more adventurous, young Ward would venture down into this maelstrom of tottering houses, broken transoms, tumbling steps, twisted balustrades, swarthy faces, and nameless odours; winding from South Main to South Water, searching out the docks where the bay and sound steamers still touched, and returning northward at this lower level past the steep-roofed 1816 warehouses and the broad square at the Great Bridge, where the 1773 Market House still stands firm on its ancient arches. In that square he would pause to drink in the bewildering beauty of the old town as it rises on its eastward bluff, decked with its two Georgian spires and crowned by the vast new Christian Science dome as London is crowned by St. Pauls. He liked mostly to reach this point in the late afternoon, when the slanting sunlight touches the Market House and the ancient hill roofs and belfries with gold, and throws magic around the dreaming wharves where Providence Indiamen used to ride at anchor. After a long look he would grow almost dizzy with a poets love for the sight, and then he would scale the slope homeward in the dusk past the old white church and up the narrow precipitous ways where yellow gleams would begin to peep out in small-paned windows and through fanlights set high over double flights of steps with curious wrought-iron railings.      At other times, and in later years, he would seek for vivid contrasts; spending half a walk in the crumbling colonial regions northwest of his home, where the hill drops to the lower eminence of Stampers Hill with its ghetto and negro quarter clustering round the place where the Boston stage coach used to start before the Revolution, and the other half in the gracious southerly realm about George, Benevolent, Power, and Williams Streets, where the old slope holds unchanged the fine estates and bits of walled garden and steep green lane in which so many fragrant memories linger. These rambles, together with the diligent studies which accompanied them, certainly account for a large amount of the antiquarian lore which at last crowded the modern world from Charles Wards mind; and illustrate the mental soil upon which fell, in that fateful winter of 1919-20, the seeds that came to such strange and terrible fruition.      Dr. Willett is certain that, up to this ill-omened winter of first change, Charles Wards antiquarianism was free from every trace of the morbid. Graveyards held for him no particular attraction beyond their quaintness and historic value, and of anything like violence or savage instinct he was utterly devoid. Then, by insidious degrees, there appeared to develop a curious sequel to one of his genealogical triumphs of the year before; when he had discovered among his maternal ancestors a certain very long-lived man named Joseph Curwen, who had come from Salem in March of 1692, and about whom a whispered series of highly peculiar and disquieting stories clustered.      Wards great-great-grandfather Welcome Potter had in 1785 married a certain \"Ann Tillinghast, daughter of Mrs. Eliza, daughter to Capt. James Tillinghast\", of whose paternity the family had preserved no trace. Late in 1918, whilst examining a volume of original town records in manuscript, the young genealogist encountered an entry describing a legal change of name, by which in 1772 a Mrs. Eliza Curwen, widow of Joseph Curwen, resumed, along with her seven-year-old daughter Ann, her maiden name of Tillinghast; on the ground that her Husbands name was become a publick Reproach by Reason of what was knowne after his Decease; the which confirming an antient common Rumour, tho not to be credited by a loyall Wife till so proven as to be wholely past Doubting. This entry came to light upon the accidental separation of two leaves which had been carefully pasted together and treated as one by a laboured revision of the page numbers.      It was at once clear to Charles Ward that he had indeed discovered a hitherto unknown great-great-great-grandfather. The discovery doubly excited him because he had already heard vague reports and seen scattered allusions relating to this person; about whom there remained so few publicly available records, aside from those becoming public only in modern times, that it almost seemed as if a conspiracy had existed to blot him from memory. What did appear, moreover, was of such a singular and provocative nature that one could not fail to imagine curiously what it was that the colonial recorders were so anxious to conceal and forget; or to suspect that the deletion had reasons all too valid.      Before this, Ward had been content to let his romancing about old Joseph Curwen remain in the idle stage; but having discovered his own relationship to this apparently \"hushed-up\" character, he proceeded to hunt out as systematically as possible whatever he might find concerning him. In this excited quest he eventually succeeded beyond his highest expectations; for old letters, diaries, and sheaves of unpublished memoirs in cobwebbed Providence garrets and elsewhere yielded many illuminating passages which their writers had not thought it worth their while to destroy. One important sidelight came from a point as remote as New York, where some Rhode Island colonial correspondence was stored in the Museum at Fraunces Tavern. The really crucial thing, though, and what in Dr. Willetts opinion formed the definite source of Wards undoing, was the matter found in August 1919 behind the panelling of the crumbling house in Olney Court. It was that, beyond a doubt, which opened up those black vistas whose end was deeper than the pit.", "VII.Yet all this was only the prologue of the actual Dunwich horror. Formalities were gone through by bewildered officials, abnormal details were duly kept from press and public, and men were sent to Dunwich and Aylesbury to look up property and notify any who might be heirs of the late Wilbur Whateley. They found the countryside in great agitation, both because of the growing rumblings beneath the domed hills, and because of the unwonted stench and the surging, lapping sounds which came increasingly from the great empty shell formed by Whateley’s boarded-up farmhouse. Earl Sawyer, who tended the horse and cattle during Wilbur’s absence, had developed a woefully acute case of nerves. The officials devised excuses not to enter the noisome boarded place; and were glad to confine their survey of the deceased’s living quarters, the newly mended sheds, to a single visit. They filed a ponderous report at the court-house in Aylesbury, and litigations concerning heirship are said to be still in progress amongst the innumerable Whateleys, decayed and undecayed, of the upper Miskatonic valley.      An almost interminable manuscript in strange characters, written in a huge ledger and adjudged a sort of diary because of the spacing and the variations in ink and penmanship, presented a baffling puzzle to those who found it on the old bureau which served as its owner’s desk. After a week of debate it was sent to Miskatonic University, together with the deceased’s collection of strange books, for study and possible translation; but even the best linguists soon saw that it was not likely to be unriddled with ease. No trace of the ancient gold with which Wilbur and Old Whateley always paid their debts has yet been discovered.      It was in the dark of September 9th that the horror broke loose. The hill noises had been very pronounced during the evening, and dogs barked frantically all night. Early risers on the 10th noticed a peculiar stench in the air. About seven o’clock Luther Brown, the hired boy at George Corey’s, between Cold Spring Glen and the village, rushed frenziedly back from his morning trip to Ten-Acre Meadow with the cows. He was almost convulsed with fright as he stumbled into the kitchen; and in the yard outside the no less frightened herd were pawing and lowing pitifully, having followed the boy back in the panic they shared with him. Between gasps Luther tried to stammer out his tale to Mrs. Corey.      “Up thar in the rud beyont the glen, Mis’ Corey—they’s suthin’ ben thar! It smells like thunder, an’ all the bushes an’ little trees is pushed back from the rud like they’d a haouse ben moved along of it. An’ that ain’t the wust, nuther. They’s prints in the rud, Mis’ Corey—great raound prints as big as barrel-heads, all sunk daown deep like a elephant had ben along, only they’s a sight more nor four feet could make! I looked at one or two afore I run, an’ I see every one was covered with lines spreadin’ aout from one place, like as if big palm-leaf fans—twict or three times as big as any they is—hed of ben paounded daown into the rud. An’ the smell was awful, like what it is araound Wizard Whateley’s ol’ haouse. . . .”      Here he faltered, and seemed to shiver afresh with the fright that had sent him flying home. Mrs. Corey, unable to extract more information, began telephoning the neighbours; thus starting on its rounds the overture of panic that heralded the major terrors. When she got Sally Sawyer, housekeeper at Seth Bishop’s, the nearest place to Whateley’s, it became her turn to listen instead of transmit; for Sally’s boy Chauncey, who slept poorly, had been up on the hill toward Whateley’s, and had dashed back in terror after one look at the place, and at the pasturage where Mr. Bishop’s cows had been left out all night.      “Yes, Mis’ Corey,” came Sally’s tremulous voice over the party wire, “Cha’ncey he just come back a-postin’, and couldn’t haff talk fer bein’ scairt! He says Ol’ Whateley’s haouse is all blowed up, with the timbers scattered raound like they’d ben dynamite inside; only the bottom floor ain’t through, but is all covered with a kind o’ tar-like stuff that smells awful an’ drips daown offen the aidges onto the graoun’ whar the side timbers is blown away. An’ they’s awful kinder marks in the yard, tew—great raound marks bigger raound than a hogshead, an’ all sticky with stuff like is on the blowed-up haouse. Cha’ncey he says they leads off into the medders, whar a great swath wider’n a barn is matted daown, an’ all the stun walls tumbled every whichway wherever it goes.      “An’ he says, says he, Mis’ Corey, as haow he sot to look fer Seth’s caows, frighted ez he was; an’ faound ’em in the upper pasture nigh the Devil’s Hop Yard in an awful shape. Haff on ’em’s clean gone, an’ nigh haff o’ them that’s left is sucked most dry o’ blood, with sores on ’em like they’s ben on Whateley’s cattle ever senct Lavinny’s black brat was born. Seth he’s gone aout naow to look at ’em, though I’ll vaow he wun’t keer ter git very nigh Wizard Whateley’s! Cha’ncey didn’t look keerful ter see whar the big matted-daown swath led arter it leff the pasturage, but he says he thinks it p’inted towards the glen rud to the village.      “I tell ye, Mis’ Corey, they’s suthin’ abroad as hadn’t orter be abroad, an’ I for one think that black Wilbur Whateley, as come to the bad eend he desarved, is at the bottom of the breedin’ of it. He wa’n’t all human hisself, I allus says to everybody; an’ I think he an’ Ol’ Whateley must a raised suthin’ in that there nailed-up haouse as ain’t even so human as he was. They’s allus ben unseen things araound Dunwich—livin’ things—as ain’t human an’ ain’t good fer human folks.      “The graoun’ was a-talkin’ lass night, an’ towards mornin’ Cha’ncey he heerd the whippoorwills so laoud in Col’ Spring Glen he couldn’t sleep nun. Then he thought he heerd another faint-like saound over towards Wizard Whateley’s—a kinder rippin’ or tearin’ o’ wood, like some big box er crate was bein’ opened fur off. What with this an’ that, he didn’t git to sleep at all till sunup, an’ no sooner was he up this mornin’, but he’s got to go over to Whateley’s an’ see what’s the matter. He see enough, I tell ye, Mis’ Corey! This dun’t mean no good, an’ I think as all the men-folks ought to git up a party an’ do suthin’. I know suthin’ awful’s abaout, an’ feel my time is nigh, though only Gawd knows jest what it is.      “Did your Luther take accaount o’ whar them big tracks led tew? No? Wal, Mis’ Corey, ef they was on the glen rud this side o’ the glen, an’ ain’t got to your haouse yet, I calc’late they must go into the glen itself. They would do that. I allus says Col’ Spring Glen ain’t no healthy nor decent place. The whippoorwills an’ fireflies there never did act like they was creaters o’ Gawd, an’ they’s them as says ye kin hear strange things a-rushin’ an’ a-talkin’ in the air daown thar ef ye stand in the right place, atween the rock falls an’ Bear’s Den.”      By that noon fully three-quarters of the men and boys of Dunwich were trooping over the roads and meadows between the new-made Whateley ruins and Cold Spring Glen, examining in horror the vast, monstrous prints, the maimed Bishop cattle, the strange, noisome wreck of the farmhouse, and the bruised, matted vegetation of the fields and roadsides. Whatever had burst loose upon the world had assuredly gone down into the great sinister ravine; for all the trees on the banks were bent and broken, and a great avenue had been gouged in the precipice-hanging underbrush. It was as though a house, launched by an avalanche, had slid down through the tangled growths of the almost vertical slope. From below no sound came, but only a distant, undefinable foetor; and it is not to be wondered at that the men preferred to stay on the edge and argue, rather than descend and beard the unknown Cyclopean horror in its lair. Three dogs that were with the party had barked furiously at first, but seemed cowed and reluctant when near the glen. Someone telephoned the news to the Aylesbury Transcript; but the editor, accustomed to wild tales from Dunwich, did no more than concoct a humorous paragraph about it; an item soon afterward reproduced by the Associated Press.      That night everyone went home, and every house and barn was barricaded as stoutly as possible. Needless to say, no cattle were allowed to remain in open pasturage. About two in the morning a frightful stench and the savage barking of the dogs awakened the household at Elmer Frye’s, on the eastern edge of Cold Spring Glen, and all agreed that they could hear a sort of muffled swishing or lapping sound from somewhere outside. Mrs. Frye proposed telephoning the neighbours, and Elmer was about to agree when the noise of splintering wood burst in upon their deliberations. It came, apparently, from the barn; and was quickly followed by a hideous screaming and stamping amongst the cattle. The dogs slavered and crouched close to the feet of the fear-numbed family. Frye lit a lantern through force of habit, but knew it would be death to go out into that black farmyard. The children and the womenfolk whimpered, kept from screaming by some obscure, vestigial instinct of defence which told them their lives depended on silence. At last the noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful moaning, and a great snapping, crashing, and crackling ensued. The Fryes, huddled together in the sitting-room, did not dare to move until the last echoes died away far down in Cold Spring Glen. Then, amidst the dismal moans from the stable and the daemoniac piping of late whippoorwills in the glen, Selina Frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she could of the second phase of the horror.      The next day all the countryside was in a panic; and cowed, uncommunicative groups came and went where the fiendish thing had occurred. Two titan swaths of destruction stretched from the glen to the Frye farmyard, monstrous prints covered the bare patches of ground, and one side of the old red barn had completely caved in. Of the cattle, only a quarter could be found and identified. Some of these were in curious fragments, and all that survived had to be shot. Earl Sawyer suggested that help be asked from Aylesbury or Arkham, but others maintained it would be of no use. Old Zebulon Whateley, of a branch that hovered about half way between soundness and decadence, made darkly wild suggestions about rites that ought to be practiced on the hill-tops. He came of a line where tradition ran strong, and his memories of chantings in the great stone circles were not altogether connected with Wilbur and his grandfather.      Darkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organise for real defence. In a few cases closely related families would band together and watch in the gloom under one roof; but in general there was only a repetition of the barricading of the night before, and a futile, ineffective gesture of loading muskets and setting pitchforks handily about. Nothing, however, occurred except some hill noises; and when the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had gone as swiftly as it had come. There were even bold souls who proposed an offensive expedition down in the glen, though they did not venture to set an actual example to the still reluctant majority.      When night came again the barricading was repeated, though there was less huddling together of families. In the morning both the Frye and the Seth Bishop households reported excitement among the dogs and vague sounds and stenches from afar, while early explorers noted with horror a fresh set of the monstrous tracks in the road skirting Sentinel Hill. As before, the sides of the road shewed a bruising indicative of the blasphemously stupendous bulk of the horror; whilst the conformation of the tracks seemed to argue a passage in two directions, as if the moving mountain had come from Cold Spring Glen and returned to it along the same path. At the base of the hill a thirty-foot swath of crushed shrubbery saplings led steeply upward, and the seekers gasped when they saw that even the most perpendicular places did not deflect the inexorable trail. Whatever the horror was, it could scale a sheer stony cliff of almost complete verticality; and as the investigators climbed around to the hill’s summit by safer routes they saw that the trail ended—or rather, reversed—there.      It was here that the Whateleys used to build their hellish fires and chant their hellish rituals by the table-like stone on May-Eve and Hallowmass. Now that very stone formed the centre of a vast space thrashed around by the mountainous horror, whilst upon its slightly concave surface was a thick and foetid deposit of the same tarry stickiness observed on the floor of the ruined Whateley farmhouse when the horror escaped. Men looked at one another and muttered. Then they looked down the hill. Apparently the horror had descended by a route much the same as that of its ascent. To speculate was futile. Reason, logic, and normal ideas of motivation stood confounded. Only old Zebulon, who was not with the group, could have done justice to the situation or suggested a plausible explanation.      Thursday night began much like the others, but it ended less happily. The whippoorwills in the glen had screamed with such unusual persistence that many could not sleep, and about 3 A.M. all the party telephones rang tremulously. Those who took down their receivers heard a fright-mad voice shriek out, “Help, oh, my Gawd! . . .” and some thought a crashing sound followed the breaking off of the exclamation. There was nothing more. No one dared do anything, and no one knew till morning whence the call came. Then those who had heard it called everyone on the line, and found that only the Fryes did not reply. The truth appeared an hour later, when a hastily assembled group of armed men trudged out to the Frye place at the head of the glen. It was horrible, yet hardly a surprise. There were more swaths and monstrous prints, but there was no longer any house. It had caved in like an egg-shell, and amongst the ruins nothing living or dead could be discovered. Only a stench and a tarry stickiness. The Elmer Fryes had been erased from Dunwich."]}

The line was from an old song from the soundtrack of an old Japanese anime that had confused and depressed the hell out of him. He shook his head, Heavens Not Enough, Steve Conte, Wolfs Rain soundtrack, No... there had been two soundtracks for that series, this was the first song on the second. Why wasnt it called Wolves Rain? He thought, trying to dispel the sad song, but it played on, and he was even singing softly toward the songs end...Cause I couldnt cryCause I turned awayCouldnt see the scoreDidnt know the painOf leaving yesterday really far behindin another lifein another dreamBy a different namegave it all away for a memory and a quiet lieand I felt the face Of the cold tonightStill dont know the scoreBut I know the painOf leaving everything really far behind ...Thus distracted, he did not see Dahlman.The sorcerer was a servant of the He Who Gnaws in The Darkness. Azathoth was neither ally nor enemy to Cthulhu, he was actually his Great-Grandfather having sired both Yog-Sothoth and Shub-Niggurath, who had sired Nug and Yeb, Nug being Cthulhus parent by parthogenesis. Azathoths worshipers, however, tended to be madmen in the truest sense. He was a mindless entity, neither desiring nor rewarding worship. Some of the gods who danced round and round his throne often took it upon themselves to accept his worship and grant gifts in his behalf. Especially Nyarlathotep...The Outer Gods were the key. Humans were a weak species, helpless in the face of even the least of The Great Old Ones. But by learning, by studying the Outer Gods, by utilizing their power, a human could assume a form of divinity themselves. For decades Dahlman had faithfully studied the ancient texts, The Book of Eibon, The Necronomicon, The Book of Iod, and he had learned to harness the power of those who lurked mindless and blind beyond the thin veil of reality. And now he would prove his worth, he would bring down an immortal, the child of a god...A bolt of lightning shook Torren-Wraeth from his revery, it barely hurt, but he could tell it was not natural. He turned to see a black-clad figuring closing in upon him, and erected a Deflect Harm even as the human struck out with Fist of Yog-Sothoth. \"Okay, now youre annoying me.\" Torren-Wraeth lashed out with Implant Fear, hoping to avoid having to actually kill this irrational attacker. He disliked sorcerers, but he also disliked having to harm people. But the madman had cast Deflect Harm upon himself, and, thus protected, struck back with The Dread Curse of Azathoth. Torren-Wraeth reeled, Now that hurt! Enraged, Torren-Wraeth physically rushed the sorcerer, ignoring the protective amulet the man held out, and punched him square in the nose, breaking it. Distracted by the pain, Dahlman fell before Implant Fear.Dahlmans mind was instantly overwhelmed with unimaginable fear and he turned to flee, all spells forgotten in his terror, only to run into a golden monstrosity streaking toward him in the dawning sky. He called frantically upon his gods to save him. But these were not benevolent gods, they were fickle, and enjoyed granting lesser beings great power, just to have the pleasure of snatching it away. His gods deserted him mid-flight, his skin shriveled and shrank tight against his bones as he aged in seconds. The capricious Outer Gods no doubt laughed as their former ward fell into the sea, and was immediately set upon by sharks.Torren-Wraeth and Tek watched impassively as the dying sorcerer fell into the sea.\"Who was that?\"\"I have no idea.\"\"And I thought you were in trouble.\"\"Sorry.\"\"You do get in the strangest situations.\" Tek observed wryly.\"Sorry.\"Youve made me late, you know.\"\"Sorry about that.\"\"Its okay, I could use the break. A word of advice, never marry a woman with five mouths.\"Both Tek and Torren-Wraeth laughed.Ho Fong arched an eyebrow as he saw the disheveled Torren-Wraeth accompanying Lord Tektaktequataquarl. Hed seen him before, of course, he occasionally visited alongside Tek, though his distaste for the ritual sacrifices of human beings was clearly evident. Fortunately, no such events were scheduled. \"Are you alright, Lord Torren-Wraeth?\" He knew better than to call him simply Torren or Wraeth. \"Ill be all right, Master Ho,\" Torren-Wraeth said with perfect Chinese courtesy, \"But I would be most grateful for a place to rest for a while.\" Ho Fong smiled, \"Of course,\" he turned, \"Ping, take lord Torren-Wraeth to one of the guest areas and provide him with whatever refreshments he requires.\" A youngish monk, dressed in the standard yellow and black silk, stepped forward and led Torren-Wraeth deeper into the monastery.It was instantly obvious to Torren-Wraeth that Ping was not Chinese, at least, not in the ethnic sense. He was one of the dreaded Tcho-Tcho people, descendants of toad-like creatures created by the Great Old One Chaugnar Faugn and human cultists. The Tcho-Tcho had an evil reputation, one well earned. The vast majority of them served the Great Old Ones, and many practiced cannibalism. There were exceptions, of course, not all Tcho-Tcho were evil or insane, but those individuals were usually outcasts, hated and sometimes even hunted by their own people. As they walked, Torren-Wraeth halted for a moment before an idol of carved black stone. It was well-crafted and incredibly detailed, lean muscled and lanky, wings extended, the webbed hands held palm up like a divine supplicant, the curving trunk-mouth lifted upward as if it were sounding a call. A call to Death itself, for this was Shugoran, The Herald of Death, worshiped and feared by the Tcho-Tcho people. Ping knelt reverently then hurried Torren-Wraeth into a nearby chamber.The scent of Black Lotus was thick in the air as the monks shut the great copper door behind Tek. \"You really shouldnt smoke you know,\" he said casually, \"Terrible for the lungs...\" The Bloated Woman rose from her cushions, \"Only if you are a mortal, which I am not.\" Tek smiled, then shed his semblance of humanity, becoming a writhing, shapeless mass of golden flesh, golden tentacles, golden eyes and pearly white fangs. \"What of our child?\" Several mouths spoke at once. The Goddess came closer with a grace unfitting such an obese creature. \"Nothing can harm our offspring.\" \"How long, do you think?\" The Bloated Woman stopped, apparently this visit was for business, not pleasure. \"It is impossible to tell. I have born some children within days of conception, and others within centuries.\" She sensed a slight jealous possessiveness on the part of the Hastur-Spawn, he wanted her as his sole mate, an amusing and archaic notion, not often seen in a True-Blood. The fact that he knew she had devoured most of the former lovers did not apparently assuage this unseemly feeling. \"I feel that this one will be born within a month or two...\" She grinned horribly with all five mouths, \"How has your father reacted?\" \"Our child will be welcome in Carcosa.\" Hastur, in truth, was somewhat worried, fearing that the child would be another avatar of Nyarlathotep, that the Crawling Chaos would use the child as yet another form in which to manifest itself. In other words, he feared that Nyarlathotep would give birth to itself...For all the vile practices that went on in the Monastery of The Bloated Woman, it was a beautiful place, richly decorated in jade and silver, gold and silk. Yellow and black, every strand of silk in the monastery was either yellow or black. The yellow made for a much friendlier environment than the dark, ominous stones of RLyeh. The Goddess favored those colors, for some reason. Torren-Wraeth remembered something Goro had once said. Among his people and several other Asian cultures, yellow was the color of mourning. Black meant death and mourning in the West, yellow filled that role in the East. Was it intentional? Probably, but he was a guest, and it would be rude to question his hosts. He changed from his slightly charred clothing into the yellow and black robes that had been kindly provided him and stepped out into the hallway. There he saw Ping once again kneeling before Shugoran.", "Rodrigo [possessed] - \"The flies are their own lords, and ours as well.\"Benevento Chieti Bordighera - Massa di Requiem per ShuggayColonel Reginald Barnes wiped his sweating brow and cursed the infernal swamp. He double cursed the countless insects that seemed to make up the entire population of this sodden hell. He turned and motioned his men to halt. They were a hearty group, but the hardships of the swamp were bearing down on them. All were tired, their muscles aching, and most had open sores which the wretched little vermin were viciously exploiting.Private Sands was buried a few miles back, victim of some malignant strain of malaria that ignored quinine and killed within hours. The colonel wondered for a moment about the natives warnings. The natives had cautioned them to avoid this swamp, and the blacks feared this place so much that their normally loyal bearers had fled like rabbits rather than enter the lair of the insect god. As far as Barnes pidgin could make out, the natives believed that a giant insect lived within the swamp, ruling all its lesser kin. To add even greater spice to the tale, it was something of a Typhoid Mary, a many-legged Horseman of Pestilence. Rubbish, to be sure, but this swamp was undeniably unhealthy, as poor Private Sands had learned.Still, this was part of The Kings realm, and as such it was to be charted and explored. Any natives, (and he personally doubted even the hardiest of the Africans could survive in this God-forsaken place), introduced to the Enlightenment that came with British colonization.They were suffering for God, King and Country.That didnt make it any less painful.Humans were entering his domain. Not the natives, they knew of Him. They had the wisdom to avoid Him. Not so with these creatures. They were explorers and soldiers, enforcing the will of their mortal King in behalf of their flickering shadow of an empire. They were determined to come. To claim this land for their empire of dust.But this was His empire. His land. He had been driven from His world, from Shaggai. The Harbinger and The Worm That Gnaws In The Night had driven Him from His home. He had searched for centuries to find sanctuary. He would not give up His new home in the face of humanity.Baoht Zuqqa-Mogg stirred sluggishly, pulling His vast bulk from the slime and mire. He shook the muck from His six wings. Many-faceted eyes surveyed the area. The humans had wandered far too close to his lair. He bore no malice toward men, but He could not allow His realm to be infested by the violent ape-things.Such was His power that little could live in His presence. One had already perished, the swarms had infected them all. In the unlikely event any of them lived long enough to reach other humans they would set off a plague. Such weak creatures, these humans.It was an act of mercy, really.The swarms were intense, mosquitoes, tsetse flies and insects even the most knowledgeable of the men could not identify vied for a taste of their blood. One could barely see his hands in front of his face for the blood-thirsty little horrors. Still they pressed on, through baking heat and boiling humidity. Barnes could almost believe that some great insect god ruled this dark, dismal boil on the face of the earth. He sincerely hoped that the His Majesty would let the Germans have this sweltering hellhole.\"Sir,\" Private Carter pointed out, \"The swarms. Theres nothin else, sir. I mean, no animals. No birds. Just insects.\"\"Theyre just hiding, private. Ive seen a few snakes and lizards about. Animals have a natural fear of man. Nothing to bother about.\" In truth, Barnes himself wondered about the lack of wildlife. It was true that animals, even large ones, would hide from a company of men, but the absence of birds of any kind was disturbing. Even in the Sahara, hed seen birds. A swamp in the heart of Africa should be positively teeming with them. His hands went over his Rigby. Hed taken down a charging bull elephant in Malaya with that gun.He slid in a cartridge.He wondered for a moment if he were ill, thinking of using a Rigby on a swarm of infernal insects.A horrible smell filled the thick air, an overpowering reek of swamp stench and death. The men turned as one as something thundered through the thick trees and muck toward them.What came crashing through the brush was no earthly insect. Over six metres of horror reared up before them. It was a titanic perversion of a scorpion. The head was vaguely suggestive of a walnut, albeit covered with gleaming yellow eyes and twitching antennae. Yellow bile dripped from sharp mandibles, hissing as it hit the soggy ground. Its greenish-black body was thick and armored, dripping ichor, wet mud and maggots. Three sets of tattered, membranous wings and ten spindly, clawed legs sprouted from its thorax. It had the massive pincers and thick, segmented tail of a scorpion. More of the yellow venom dripped from the creatures metre long stinger. Disgusting vermin crawled across its foul body, surrounded it in thick clouds and seemed to pour from the segments between its exoskeleton.\"Its Beelzebub himself!\" Someone shouted. From the look of the thing, Barnes was inclined to agree.He raised his rifle, The Lord of The Flies, eh? Lets see how he holds up against the might of The British Empire!No order was needed. Barnes let loose with his Rigby as the men began to fire. The .450 Nitro Express struck the beast square in the head, eliciting little more than an angry hiss. A shot meant for taking down rhinoceros and elephants barely seemed to sting the abomination. The swarm was upon them before he could reload. The Rigby fell from his hands as Barnes fell to his knees, then collapsed into the mud. The screams of his men were almost drowned out by the insidious buzzing and overwhelming sensation of weakness that swept through his form. Wormwood. . . He thought as the world grew dark about him.A thin trickle of yellow ichor flowed from the injured eye. It hurt, but the wound was already healing. Baoht Zuqqa-Mogg picked up the weapon in His right claw, examined it. It was a crude device, but it had drawn blood. The humans were growing stronger. Smarter, in their own primitive way. And bolder. The day might come when He would have to fight them in numbers to protect His land. He snapped the weapon in two with His claw and cast it into the mud. He looked over the dying men, prying from their feeble, fevered brains the identity of this Beelzebub they took Him for. It was an unfair comparison in His eyes, but understandable given their limited intellects. He quickly slew them all, sparing them the agony of slow death by infection.The wound was completely healed as The Bringer of Pestilence nestled once more into the comfortable muck and mire of the swamp. His home was secure, for now."]}

That he at once took an intense interest in everything pertaining to the bygone mystery is not to be wondered at; for every vague rumour that he had heard of Curwen now became something vital to himself, in whom flowed Curwens blood. No spirited and imaginative genealogist could have done otherwise than begin forthwith an avid and systematic collection of Curwen data.      In his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at secrecy; so that even Dr. Lyman hesitates to date the youths madness from any period before the close of 1919. He talked freely with his family - though his mother was not particularly pleased to own an ancestor like Curwen - and with the officials of the various museums and libraries he visited. In applying to private families for records thought to be in their possession he made no concealment of his object, and shared the somewhat amused scepticism with which the accounts of the old diarists and letter-writers were regarded. He often expressed a keen wonder as to what really had taken place a century and a half before at that Pawtuxet farmhouse whose site he vainly tried to find, and what Joseph Curwen really had been.      When he came across the Smith diary and archives and encountered the letter from Jedediah Orne he decided to visit Salem and look up Curwens early activities and connexions there, which he did during the Easter vacation of 1919. At the Essex Institute, which was well known to him from former sojourns in the glamorous old town of crumbling Puritan gables and clustered gambrel roofs, he was very kindly received, and unearthed there a considerable amount of Curwen data. He found that his ancestor was born in Salem-Village, now Danvers, seven miles from town, on the eighteenth of February (O.S.) 1662-3; and that he had run away to sea at the age of fifteen, not appearing again for nine years, when he returned with the speech, dress, and manners of a native Englishman and settled in Salem proper. At that time he had little to do with his family, but spent most of his hours with the curious books he had brought from Europe, and the strange chemicals which came for him on ships from England, France, and Holland. Certain trips of his into the country were the objects of much local inquisitiveness, and were whisperingly associated with vague rumours of fires on the hills at night.      Curwens only close friends had been one Edward Hutchinson of Salem-Village and one Simon Orne of Salem. With these men he was often seen in conference about the Common, and visits among them were by no means infrequent. Hutchinson had a house well out toward the woods, and it was not altogether liked by sensitive people because of the sounds heard there at night. He was said to entertain strange visitors, and the lights seen from his windows were not always of the same colour. The knowledge he displayed concerning long-dead persons and long-forgotten events was considered distinctly unwholesome, and he disappeared about the time the witchcraft panic began, never to be heard from again. At that time Joseph Curwen also departed, but his settlement in Providence was soon learned of. Simon Orne lived in Salem until 1720, when his failure to grow visibly old began to excite attention. He thereafter disappeared, though thirty years later his precise counterpart and self-styled son turned up to claim his property. The claim was allowed on the strength of documents in Simon Ornes known hand, and Jedediah Orne continued to dwell in Salem till 1771, when certain letters from Providence citizens to the Rev. Thomas Barnard and others brought about his quiet removal to parts unknown.      Certain documents by and about all of these strange characters were available at the Essex Institute, the Court House, and the Registry of Deeds, and included both harmless commonplaces such as land titles and bills of sale, and furtive fragments of a more provocative nature. There were four or five unmistakable allusions to them on the witchcraft trial records; as when one Hepzibah Lawson swore on July 10, 1692, at the Court of Oyer and Terminer under Judge Hathorne, that fortie Witches and the Blacke Man were wont to meete in the Woodes behind Mr. Hutchinsons house, and one Amity How declared at a session of August 8th before Judge Gedney that Mr. G. B. (Rev. George Burroughs) on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B. Then there was a catalogue of Hutchinsons uncanny library as found after his disappearance, and an unfinished manuscript in his handwriting, couched in a cipher none could read. Ward had a photostatic copy of this manuscript made, and began to work casually on the cipher as soon as it was delivered to him. After the following August his labours on the cipher became intense and feverish, and there is reason to believe from his speech and conduct that he hit upon the key before October or November. He never stated, though, whether or not he had succeeded.      But of the greatest immediate interest was the Orne material. It took Ward only a short time to prove from identity of penmanship a thing he had already considered established from the text of the letter to Curwen; namely, that Simon Orne and his supposed son were one and the same person. As Orne had said to his correspondent, it was hardly safe to live too long in Salem, hence he resorted to a thirty-year sojourn abroad, and did not return to claim his lands except as a representative of a new generation. Orne had apparently been careful to destroy most of his correspondence, but the citizens who took action in 1771 found and preserved a few letters and papers which excited their wonder. There were cryptic formulae and diagrams in his and other hands which Ward now either copied with care or had photographed, and one extremely mysterious letter in a chirography that the searcher recognised from items in the Registry of Deeds as positively Joseph Curwens.      This Curwen letter, though undated as to the year, was evidently not the one in answer to which Orne had written the confiscated missive; and from internal evidence Ward placed it not much later than 1750. It may not be amiss to give the text in full, as a sample of the style of one whose history was so dark and terrible. The recipient is addressed as \"Simon\", but a line (whether drawn by Curwen or Orne Ward could not tell) is run through the word.Prouidence, I.

This letter, oddly enough, was what first gave Ward the exact location of Curwens Providence home; for none of the records encountered up to that time had been at all specific. The discovery was doubly striking because it indicated as the newer Curwen house built in 1761 on the site of the old, a dilapidated building still standing in Olney Court and well known to Ward in his antiquarian rambles over Stampers Hill. The place was indeed only a few squares from his own home on the great hills higher ground, and was now the abode of a negro family much esteemed for occasional washing, housecleaning, and furnace-tending services. To find, in distant Salem, such sudden proof of the significance of this familiar rookery in his own family history, was a highly impressive thing to Ward; and he resolved to explore the place immediately upon his return. The more mystical phases of the letter, which he took to be some extravagant kind of symbolism, frankly baffled him; though he noted with a thrill of curiosity that the Biblical passage referred to - Job 14, 14 - was the familiar verse, \"If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.\"2.      Young Ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement, and spent the following Saturday in a long and exhaustive study of the house in Olney Court. The place, now crumbling with age, had never been a mansion; but was a modest two-and-a-half story wooden town house of the familiar Providence colonial type, with plain peaked roof, large central chimney, and artistically carved doorway with rayed fanlight, triangular pediment, and trim Doric pilasters. It had suffered but little alteration externally, and Ward felt he was gazing on something very close to the sinister matters of his quest.      The present negro inhabitants were known to him, and he was very courteously shewn about the interior by old Asa and his stout wife Hannah. Here there was more change than the outside indicated, and Ward saw with regret that fully half of the fine scroll-and-urn overmantels and shell-carved cupboard linings were gone, whilst much of the fine wainscotting and bolection moulding was marked, hacked, and gouged, or covered up altogether with cheap wall-paper. In general, the survey did not yield as much as Ward had somehow expected; but it was at least exciting to stand within the ancestral walls which had housed such a man of horror as Joseph Curwen. He saw with a thrill that a monogram had been very carefully effaced from the ancient brass knocker.      From then until after the close of school Ward spent his time on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local Curwen data. The former still proved unyielding; but of the latter he obtained so much, and so many clues to similar data elsewhere, that he was ready by July to make a trip to New London and New York to consult old letters whose presence in those places was indicated. This trip was very fruitful, for it brought him the Fenner letters with their terrible description of the Pawtuxet farmhouse raid, and the Nightingale-Talbot letters in which he learned of the portrait painted on a panel of the Curwen library. This matter of the portrait interested him particularly, since he would have given much to know just what Joseph Curwen looked like; and he decided to make a second search of the house in Olney Court to see if there might not be some trace of the ancient features beneath peeling coats of later paint or layers of mouldy wall-paper.      Early in August that search took place, and Ward went carefully over the walls of every room sizeable enough to have been by any possibility the library of the evil builder. He paid especial attention to the large panels of such overmantels as still remained; and was keenly excited after about an hour, when on a broad area above the fireplace in a spacious ground-floor room he became certain that the surface brought out by the peeling of several coats of paint was sensibly darker than any ordinary interior paint or the wood beneath it was likely to have been. A few more careful tests with a thin knife, and he knew that he had come upon an oil portrait of great extent. With truly scholarly restraint the youth did not risk the damage which an immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture with the knife might have done, but just retired from the scene of his discovery to enlist expert help. In three days he returned with an artist of long experience, Mr. Walter C. Dwight, whose studio is near the foot of College Hill; and that accomplished restorer of paintings set to work at once with proper methods and chemical substances. Old Asa and his wife were duly excited over their strange visitors, and were properly reimbursed for this invasion of their domestic hearth.      As day by day the work of restoration progressed, Charles Ward looked on with growing interest at the lines and shades gradually unveiled after their long oblivion. Dwight had begun at the bottom; hence since the picture was a three-quarter-length one, the face did not come out for some time. It was meanwhile seen that the subject was a spare, well-shaped man with dark-blue coat, embroidered waistcoat, black satin small-clothes, and white silk stockings, seated in a carved chair against the background of a window with wharves and ships beyond. When the head came out it was observed to bear a neat Albemarle wig, and to possess a thin, calm, undistinguished face which seemed somehow familiar to both Ward and the artist. Only at the very last, though, did the restorer and his client begin to gasp with astonishment at the details of that lean, pallid visage, and to recognise with a touch of awe the dramatic trick which heredity had played. For it took the final bath of oil and the final stroke of the delicate scraper to bring out fully the expression which centuries had hidden; and to confront the bewildered Charles Dexter Ward, dweller in the past, with his own living features in the countenance of his horrible great-great-great-grandfather.      Ward brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered, and his father at once determined to purchase the picture despite its execution on stationary panelling. The resemblance to the boy, despite an appearance of rather greater age, was marvellous; and it could be seen that through some trick of atavism the physical contours of Joseph Curwen had found precise duplication after a century and a half. Mrs. Wards resemblance to her ancestor was not at all marked, though she could recall relatives who had some of the facial characteristics shared by her son and by the bygone Curwen. She did not relish the discovery, and told her husband that he had better burn the picture instead of bringing it home. There was, she averred, something unwholesome about it; not only intrinsically, but in its very resemblance to Charles. Mr. Ward, however, was a practical man of power and affairs - a cotton manufacturer with extensive mills at Riverpoint in the Pawtuxet Valley - and not one to listen to feminine scruples. The picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to his son, and he believed the boy deserved it as a present. In this opinion, it is needless to say, Charles most heartily concurred; and a few days later Mr. Ward located the owner of the house - a small rodent-featured person with a guttural accent - and obtained the whole mantel and overmantel bearing the picture at a curtly fixed priced which cut short the impending torrent of unctuous haggling.      It now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the Ward home, where provisions were made for its thorough restoration and installation with an electric mock-fireplace in Charless third-floor study or library. To Charles was left the task of superintending this removal, and on the twenty-eighth of August he accompanied two expert workmen from the Crooker decorating firm to the house in Olney Court, where the mantel and portrait-bearing overmantel were detached with great care and precision for transportation in the companys motor truck. There was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the chimneys course, and in this young Ward observed a cubical recess about a foot square, which must have lain directly behind the head of the portrait. Curious as to what such a space might mean or contain, the youth approached and looked within; finding beneath the deep coatings of dust and soot some loose yellowed papers, a crude, thick copybook, and a few mouldering textile shreds which may have formed the ribbon binding the rest together. Blowing away the bulk of the dirt and cinders, he took up the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover. It was in a hand which he had learned to recognise at the Essex Institute, and proclaimed the volume as the \"Journall and Notes of Jos: Curwen, Gent., of Providence-Plantations, Late of Salem.\"      Excited beyond measure by his discovery, Ward shewed the book to the two curious workmen beside him. Their testimony is absolute as to the nature and genuineness of the finding, and Dr. Willett relies on them to help establish his theory that the youth was not mad when he began his major eccentricities. All the other papers were likewise in Curwens handwriting, and one of them seemed especially portentous because of its inscription: \"To Him Who Shal Come After, & How He May Gett Beyonde Time & ye Spheres.\" Another was in a cipher; the same, Ward hoped, as the Hutchinson cipher which had hitherto baffled him. A third, and here the searcher rejoiced, seemed to be a key to the cipher; whilst the fourth and fifth were addressed respectively to \"Edw: Hutchinson, Armiger\" and \"Jedediah Orne, Esq.\", or Their Heir or Heirs, or Those Representg Them. The sixth and last was inscribed: \"Joseph Curwen his Life and Travells Betn ye yeares 1678 and 1687: Of Whither He Voyagd, Where He Stayd, Whom He Sawe, and What He Learnt.\"3.      We have now reached the point from which the more academic school of alienists date Charles Wards madness. Upon his discovery the youth had looked immediately at a few of the inner pages of the book and manuscripts, and had evidently seen something which impressed him tremendously. Indeed, in shewing the titles to the workmen he appeared to guard the text itself with peculiar care, and to labour under a perturbation for which even the antiquarian and genealogical significance of the find could hardly account. Upon returning home he broke the news with an almost embarrassed air, as if he wished to convey an idea of its supreme importance without having to exhibit the evidence itself. He did not even shew the titles to his parents, but simply told them that he had found some documents in Joseph Curwens handwriting, \"mostly in cipher\", which would have to be studied very carefully before yielding up their true meaning. It is unlikely that he would have shewn what he did to the workmen, had it not been for their unconcealed curiosity. As it was he doubtless wished to avoid any display of peculiar reticence which would increase their discussion of the matter.      That night Charles Ward sat up in his room reading the new-found book and papers, and when day came he did not desist. His meals, on his urgent request when his mother called to see what was amiss, were sent up to him; and in the afternoon he appeared only briefly when the men came to install the Curwen picture and mantelpiece in his study. The next night he slept in snatches in his clothes, meanwhile wrestling feverishly with the unravelling of the cipher manuscript. In the morning his mother saw that he was at work on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher, which he had frequently shewn her before; but in response to her query he said that the Curwen key could not be applied to it. That afternoon he abandoned his work and watched the men fascinatedly as they finished their installation of the picture with its woodwork above a cleverly realistic electric log, setting the mock-fireplace and overmantel a little out from the north wall as if a chimney existed, and boxing in the sides with panelling to match the rooms. The front panel holding the picture was sawn and hinged to allow cupboard space behind it. After the workmen went he moved his work into the study and sat down before it with his eyes half on the cipher and half on the portrait which stared back at him like a year-adding and century-recalling mirror.      His parents, subsequently recalling his conduct at this period, give interesting details anent the policy of concealment which he practiced. Before servants he seldom hid any paper which he might be studying, since he rightly assumed that Curwens intricate and archaic chirography would be too much for them. With his parents, however, he was more circumspect; and unless the manuscript in question were a cipher, or a mere mass of cryptic symbols and unknown ideographs (as that entitled \"To Him Who Shal Come After etc.\" seemed to be), he would cover it with some convenient paper until his caller had departed. At night he kept the papers under lock and key in an antique cabinet of his, where he also placed them whenever he left the room. He soon resumed fairly regular hours and habits, except that his long walks and other outside interests seemed to cease. The opening of school, where he now began his senior year, seemed a great bore to him; and he frequently asserted his determination never to bother with college. He had, he said, important special investigations to make, which would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and the humanities than any university which the world could boast.      Naturally, only one who had always been more or less studious, eccentric, and solitary could have pursued this course for many days without attracting notice. Ward, however, was constitutionally a scholar and a hermit; hence his parents were less surprised than regretful at the close confinement and secrecy he adopted. At the same time, both his father and mother thought it odd that he would shew them no scrap of his treasure-trove, nor give any connected account of such data as he had deciphered. This reticence he explained away as due to a wish to wait until he might announce some connected revelation, but as the weeks passed without further disclosures there began to grow up between the youth and his family a kind of constraint; intensified in his mothers case by her manifest disapproval of all Curwen delvings.      During October Ward began visiting the libraries again, but no longer for the antiquarian matter of his former days. Witchcraft and magic, occultism and daemonology, were what he sought now; and when Providence sources proved unfruitful he would take the train for Boston and tap the wealth of the great library in Copley Square, the Widener Library at Harvard, or the Zion Research Library in Brookline, where certain rare works on Biblical subjects are available. He bought extensively, and fitted up a whole additional set of shelves in his study for newly acquired works on uncanny subjects; while during the Christmas holidays he made a round of out-of-town trips including one to Salem to consult certain records at the Essex Institute.      About the middle of January, 1920, there entered Wards bearing an element of triumph which he did not explain, and he was no more found at work upon the Hutchinson cipher. Instead, he inaugurated a dual policy of chemical research and record-scanning; fitting up for the one a laboratory in the unused attic of the house, and for the latter haunting all the sources of vital statistics in Providence. Local dealers in drugs and scientific supplies, later questioned, gave astonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and instruments he purchased; but clerks at the State House, the City Hall, and the various libraries agree as to the definite object of his second interest. He was searching intensely and feverishly for the grave of Joseph Curwen, from whose slate slab an older generation had so wisely blotted the name.      Little by little there grew upon the Ward family the conviction that something was wrong. Charles had had freaks and changes of minor interests before, but this growing secrecy and absorption in strange pursuits was unlike even him. His school work was the merest pretence; and although he failed in no test, it could be seen that the old application had all vanished. He had other concernments now; and when not in his new laboratory with a score of obsolete alchemical books, could be found either poring over old burial records down town or glued to his volumes of occult lore in his study, where the startlingly - one almost fancied increasingly - similar features of Joseph Curwen stared blandly at him from the great overmantel on the north wall.      Late in March Ward added to his archive-searching a ghoulish series of rambles about the various ancient cemeteries of the city. The cause appeared later, when it was learned from City Hall clerks that he had probably found an important clue. His quest had suddenly shifted from the grave of Joseph Curwen to that of one Naphthali Field; and this shift was explained when, upon going over the files that he had been over, the investigators actually found a fragmentary record of Curwens burial which had escaped the general obliteration, and which stated that the curious leaden coffin had been interred \"10 ft. S. and 5 ft. W. of Naphthali Fields grave in ye - \". The lack of a specified burying-ground in the surviving entry greatly complicated the search, and Naphthali Fields grave seemed as elusive as that of Curwen; but here no systematic effacement had existed, and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on the stone itself even if its record had perished. Hence the rambles - from which St. Johns (the former Kings) Churchyard and the ancient Congregational burying-ground in the midst of Swan Point Cemetery were excluded, since other statistics had shewn that the only Naphthali Field (obiit 1729) whose grave could have been meant had been a Baptist.4.      It was toward May when Dr. Willett, at the request of the senior Ward, and fortified with all the Curwen data which the family had gleaned from Charles in his non-secretive days, talked with the young man. The interview was of little value or conclusiveness, for Willett felt at every moment that Charles was thoroughly master of himself and in touch with matters of real importance; but it at least forced the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanour. Of a pallid, impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment, Ward seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits, though not to reveal their object. He stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early scientific knowledge, for the most part in cipher, of an apparent scope comparable only to the discoveries of Friar Bacon and perhaps surpassing even those. They were, however, meaningless except when correlated with a body of learning now wholly obsolete; so that their immediate presentation to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all impressiveness and dramatic significance. To take their vivid place in the history of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of which they evolved, and to this task of correlation Ward was now devoting himself. He was seeking to acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of the Curwen data must possess, and hoped in time to make a full announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to the world of thought. Not even Einstein, he declared, could more profoundly revolutionise the current conception of things.      As to his graveyard search, whose object he freely admitted, but the details of whose progress he did not relate, he said he had reason to think that Joseph Curwens mutilated headstone bore certain mystic symbols - carved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by those who had effaced the name - which were absolutely essential to the final solution of his cryptic system. Curwen, he believed, had wished to guard his secret with care; and had consequently distributed the data in an exceedingly curious fashion. When Dr. Willett asked to see the mystic documents, Ward displayed much reluctance and tried to put him off with such things as photostatic copies of the Hutchinson cipher and Orne formulae and diagrams; but finally shewed him the exteriors of some of the real Curwen finds - the \"Journall and Notes\", the cipher (title in cipher also), and the formula-filled message \"To Him Who Shal Come After\" - and let him glance inside such as were in obscure characters.      He also opened the diary at a page carefully selected for its innocuousness and gave Willett a glimpse of Curwens connected handwriting in English. The doctor noted very closely the crabbed and complicated letters, and the general aura of the seventeenth century which clung round both penmanship and style despite the writers survival into the eighteenth century, and became quickly certain that the document was genuine. The text itself was relatively trivial, and Willett recalled only a fragment:\"Wedn. 16 Octr. 1754. My Sloope the Wakeful this Day putt in from London with XX newe Men pickd up in ye Indies, Spaniards from Martineco and 2 Dutch Men from Surinam.

Simon hath not Writ these V. Weekes, but I expecte soon hearg from him.\"      When upon reaching this point Dr. Willett turned the leaf he was quickly checked by Ward, who almost snatched the book from his grasp. All that the doctor had a chance to see on the newly opened page was a brief pair of sentences; but these, strangely enough, lingered tenaciously in his memory. They ran: \"Ye Verse from Liber-Damnatus beg spoke V Roodmasses and IV Hallows-Eves, I am Hopeful ye Thing is breedg Outside ye Spheres. It will drawe One who is to Come, if I can make sure he shal bee, and he shall think on Past thinges and look back thro all ye yeares, against ye which I must have ready ye Saltes or That to make em with.\"      Willett saw no more, but somehow this small glimpse gave a new and vague terror to the painted features of Joseph Curwen which stared blandly down from the overmantel. Ever after that he entertained the odd fancy - which his medical skill of course assured him was only a fancy - that the eyes of the portrait had a sort of wish, if not an actual tendency, to follow young Charles Ward as he moved about the room. He stopped before leaving to study the picture closely, marvelling at its resemblance to Charles and memorising every minute detail of the cryptical, colourless face, even down to a slight scar or pit in the smooth brow above the right eye. Cosmo Alexander, he decided, was a painter worthy of the Scotland that produced Raeburn, and a teacher worthy of his illustrious pupil Gilbert Stuart.      Assured by the doctor that Charless mental health was in no danger, but that on the other hand he was engaged in researches which might prove of real importance, the Wards were more lenient than they might otherwise have been when during the following June the youth made positive his refusal to attend college. He had, he declared, studies of much more vital importance to pursue; and intimated a wish to go abroad the following year in order to avail himself of certain sources of data not existing in America. The senior Ward, while denying this latter wish as absurd for a boy of only eighteen, acquiesced regarding the university; so that after a none too brilliant graduation from the Moses Brown School there ensued for Charles a three-year period of intensive occult study and graveyard searching. He became recognised as an eccentric, and dropped even more completely from the sight of his familys friends than he had been before; keeping close to his work and only occasionally making trips to other cities to consult obscure records. Once he went south to talk with a strange old mulatto who dwelt in a swamp and about whom a newspaper had printed a curious article. Again he sought a small village in the Adirondacks whence reports of certain odd ceremonial practices had come. But still his parents forbade him the trip to the Old World which he desired.      Coming of age in April, 1923, and having previously inherited a small competence from his maternal grandfather, Ward determined at last to take the European trip hitherto denied him. Of his proposed itinerary he would say nothing save that the needs of his studies would carry him to many places, but he promised to write his parents fully and faithfully. When they saw he could not be dissuaded, they ceased all opposition and helped as best they could; so that in June the young man sailed for Liverpool with the farewell blessings of his father and mother, who accompanied him to Boston and waved him out of sight from the White Star pier in Charlestown. Letters soon told of his safe arrival, and of his securing good quarters in Great Russell Street, London; where he proposed to stay, shunning all family friends, till he had exhausted the resources of the British Museum in a certain direction. Of his daily life he wrote but little, for there was little to write. Study and experiment consumed all his time, and he mentioned a laboratory which he had established in one of his rooms. That he said nothing of antiquarian rambles in the glamorous old city with its luring skyline of ancient domes and steeples and its tangles of roads and alleys whose mystic convolutions and sudden vistas alternately beckon and surprise, was taken by his parents as a good index of the degree to which his new interests had engrossed his mind.      In June, 1924, a brief note told of his departure for Paris, to which he had before made one or two flying trips for material in the Bibliothque Nationale. For three months thereafter he sent only postal cards, giving an address in the Rue St. Jacques and referring to a special search among rare manuscripts in the library of an unnamed private collector. He avoided acquaintances, and no tourists brought back reports of having seen him. Then came a silence, and in October the Wards received a picture card from Prague, Czecho-Slovakia, stating that Charles was in that ancient town for the purpose of conferring with a certain very aged man supposed to be the last living possessor of some very curious mediaeval information. He gave an address in the Neustadt, and announced no move till the following January; when he dropped several cards from Vienna telling of his passage through that city on the way toward a more easterly region whither one of his correspondents and fellow-delvers into the occult had invited him.      The next card was from Klausenburg in Transylvania, and told of Wards progress toward his destination. He was going to visit a Baron Ferenczy, whose estate lay in the mountains east of Rakus; and was to be addressed at Rakus in the care of that nobleman. Another card from Rakus a week later, saying that his hosts carriage had met him and that he was leaving the village for the mountains, was his last message for a considerable time; indeed, he did not reply to his parents frequent letters until May, when he wrote to discourage the plan of his mother for a meeting in London, Paris, or Rome during the summer, when the elder Wards were planning to travel in Europe. His researches, he said, were such that he could not leave his present quarters; while the situation of Baron Ferenczys castle did not favour visits. It was on a crag in the dark wooded mountains, and the region was so shunned by the country folk that normal people could not help feeling ill at ease. Moreover, the Baron was not a person likely to appeal to correct and conservative New England gentlefolk. His aspect and manners had idiosyncrasies, and his age was so great as to be disquieting. It would be better, Charles said, if his parents would wait for his return to Providence; which could scarcely be far distant.      That return did not, however, take place until May, 1926, when after a few heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into New York on the Homeric and traversed the long miles to Providence by motor-coach, eagerly drinking in the green rolling hills, the fragrant, blossoming orchards, and the white steepled towns of vernal Connecticut; his first taste of ancient New England in nearly four years. When the coach crossed the Pawcatuck and entered Rhode Island amidst the faery goldenness of a late spring afternoon his heart beat with quickened force, and the entry to Providence along Reservoir and Elmwood avenues was a breathless and wonderful thing despite the depths of forbidden lore to which he had delved. At the high square where Broad, Weybosset, and Empire Streets join, he saw before and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant, remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town; and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down the terminal behind the Biltmore, bringing into view the great dome and soft, roof-pierced greenery of the ancient hill across the river, and the tall colonial spire of the First Baptist Church limned pink in the magic evening light against the fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous background.      Old Providence! It was this place and the mysterious forces of its long, continuous history which had brought him into being, and which had drawn him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no prophet might fix. Here lay the arcana, wondrous or dreadful as the case might be, for which all his years of travel and application had been preparing him. A taxicab whirled him through Post Office Square with its glimpse of the river, the old Market House, and the head of the bay, and up the steep curved slope of Waterman Street to Prospect, where the vast gleaming dome and sunset-flushed Ionic columns of the Christian Science Church beckoned northward. Then eight squares past the fine old estates his childish eyes had known, and the quaint brick sidewalks so often trodden by his youthful feet. And at last the little white overtaken farmhouse on the right, on the left the classic Adam porch and stately bayed facade of the great brick house where he was born. It was twilight, and Charles Dexter Ward had come home.5.      A school of alienists slightly less academic than Dr. Lymans assign to Wards European trip the beginning of his true madness. Admitting that he was sane when he started, they believe that his conduct upon returning implies a disastrous change. But even to this claim Dr. Willett refuses to accede. There was, he insists, something later; and the queernesses of the youth at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroad - odd enough things, to be sure, but by no means implying mental aberration on the part of their celebrant. Ward himself, though visibly aged and hardened, was still normal in his general reactions; and in several talks with Willett displayed a balance which no madman - even an incipient one - could feign continuously for long. What elicited the notion of insanity at this period were the sounds heard at all hours from Wards attic laboratory, in which he kept himself most of the time. There were chantings and repetitions, and thunderous declamations in uncanny rhythms; and although these sounds were always in Wards own voice, there was something in the quality of that voice, and in the accents of the formulae it pronounced, which could not but chill the blood of every hearer. It was noticed that Nig, the venerable and beloved black cat of the household, bristled and arched his back perceptibly when certain of the tones were heard.      The odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise exceedingly strange. Sometimes they were very noxious, but more often they were aromatic, with a haunting, elusive quality which seemed to have the power of inducing fantastic images. People who smelled them had a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas, with strange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite distance. Ward did not resume his old-time rambles, but applied himself diligently to the strange books he had brought home, and to equally strange delvings within his quarters; explaining that European sources had greatly enlarged the possibilities of his work, and promising great revelations in the years to come. His older aspect increased to a startling degree his resemblance to the Curwen portrait in his library; and Dr. Willett would often pause by the latter after a call, marvelling at the virtual identity, and reflecting that only the small pit above the pictures right eye now remained to differentiate the long-dead wizard from the living youth. These calls of Willetts, undertaken at the request of the senior Wards, were curious affairs. Ward at no time repulsed the doctor, but the latter saw that he could never reach the young mans inner psychology. Frequently he noted peculiar things about; little wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables, and the half-erased remnants of circles, triangles, and pentagrams in chalk or charcoal on the cleared central space of the large room. And always in the night those rhythms and incantations thundered, till it became very difficult to keep servants or suppress furtive talk of Charless madness.      In January, 1927, a peculiar incident occurred. One night about midnight, as Charles was chanting a ritual whose weird cadence echoed unpleasantly through the house below, there came a sudden gust of chill wind from the bay, and a faint, obscure trembling of the earth which everyone in the neighbourhood noted. At the same time the cat exhibited phenomenal traces of fright, while dogs bayed for as much as a mile around. This was the prelude to a sharp thunderstorm, anomalous for the season, which brought with it such a crash that Mr. and Mrs. Ward believed the house had been struck. They rushed upstairs to see what damage had been done, but Charles met them at the door to the attic; pale, resolute, and portentous, with an almost fearsome combination of triumph and seriousness on his face. He assured them that the house had not really been struck, and that the storm would soon be over. They paused, and looking through a window saw that he was indeed right; for the lightning flashed farther and farther off, whilst the trees ceased to bend in the strange frigid gust from the water. The thunder sank to a sort of dull mumbling chuckle and finally died away. Stars came out, and the stamp of triumph on Charles Wards face crystallised into a very singular expression.      For two months or more after this incident Ward was less confined than usual to his laboratory. He exhibited a curious interest in the weather, and made odd inquiries about the date of the spring thawing of the ground. One night late in March he left the house after midnight, and did not return till almost morning; when his mother, being wakeful, heard a rumbling motor draw up to the carriage entrance. Muffled oaths could be distinguished, and Mrs. Ward, rising and going to the window, saw four dark figures removing a long, heavy box from a truck at Charless direction and carrying it within by the side door. She heard laboured breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs, and finally a dull thumping in the attic; after which the footfalls descended again, and the four men reappeared outside and drove off in their truck.      The next day Charles resumed his strict attic seclusion, drawing down the dark shades of his laboratory windows and appearing to be working on some metal substance. He would open the door to no one, and steadfastly refused all proffered food. About noon a wrenching sound followed by a terrible cry and a fall were heard, but when Mrs. Ward rapped at the door her son at length answered faintly, and told her that nothing had gone amiss. The hideous and indescribable stench now welling out was absolutely harmless and unfortunately necessary. Solitude was the one prime essential, and he would appear later for dinner. That afternoon, after the conclusion of some odd hissing sounds which came from behind the locked portal, he did finally appear; wearing an extremely haggard aspect and forbidding anyone to enter the laboratory upon any pretext. This, indeed, proved the beginning of a new policy of secrecy; for never afterward was any other person permitted to visit either the mysterious garret workroom or the adjacent storeroom which he cleaned out, furnished roughly, and added to his inviolably private domain as a sleeping apartment. Here he lived, with books brought up from his library beneath, till the time he purchased the Pawtuxet bungalow and moved to it all his scientific effects.      In the evening Charles secured the paper before the rest of the family and damaged part of it through an apparent accident. Later on Dr. Willett, having fixed the date from statements by various members of the household, looked up an intact copy at the Journal office and found that in the destroyed section the following small item had occurred:Nocturnal Diggers Surprised inNorth Burial GroundRobert Hart, night watchman at the North Burial Ground, this morning discovered a party of several men with a motor truck in the oldest part of the cemetery, but apparently frightened them off before they had accomplished whatever their object may have been.      The discovery took place at about four oclock, when Harts attention was attracted by the sound of a motor outside his shelter. Investigating, he saw a large truck on the main drive several rods away; but could not reach it before the sound of his feet on the gravel had revealed his approach. The men hastily placed a large box in the truck and drove away toward the street before they could be overtaken; and since no known grave was disturbed, Hart believes that this box was an object which they wished to bury.      The diggers must have been at work for a long while before detection, for Hart found an enormous hole dug at a considerable distance back from the roadway in the lot of Amasa Field, where most of the old stones have long ago disappeared. The hole, a place as large and deep as a grave, was empty; and did not coincide with any interment mentioned in the cemetery records.      Sergt. Riley of the Second Station viewed the spot and gave the opinion that the hole was dug by bootleggers rather gruesomely and ingeniously seeking a safe cache for liquor in a place not likely to be disturbed. In reply to questions Hart said he thought the escaping truck had headed up Rochambeau Avenue, though he could not be sure.      During the next few days Ward was seldom seen by his family. Having added sleeping quarters to his attic realm, he kept closely to himself there, ordering food brought to the door and not taking it in until after the servant had gone away. The droning of monotonous formulae and the chanting of bizarre rhythms recurred at intervals, while at other times occasional listeners could detect the sound of tinkling glass, hissing chemicals, running water, or roaring gas flames. Odours of the most unplaceable quality, wholly unlike any before noted, hung at times around the door; and the air of tension observable in the young recluse whenever he did venture briefly forth was such as to excite the keenest speculation. Once he made a hasty trip to the Athenaeum for a book he required, and again he hired a messenger to fetch him a highly obscure volume from Boston. Suspense was written portentously over the whole situation, and both the family and Dr. Willett confessed themselves wholly at a loss what to do or think about it.6.      Then on the fifteenth of April a strange development occurred. While nothing appeared to grow different in kind, there was certainly a very terrible difference in degree; and Dr. Willett somehow attaches great significance to the change. The day was Good Friday, a circumstance of which the servants made much, but which others quite naturally dismiss as an irrelevant coincidence. Late in the afternoon young Ward began repeating a certain formula in a singularly loud voice, at the same time burning some substance so pungent that its fumes escaped over the entire house. The formula was so plainly audible in the hall outside the locked door that Mrs. Ward could not help memorising it as she waited and listened anxiously, and later on she was able to write it down at Dr. Willetts request. It ran as follows, and experts have told Dr. Willett that its very close analogue can be found in the mystic writings of \"Eliphas Levi\", that cryptic soul who crept through a crack in the forbidden door and glimpsed the frightful vistas of the void beyond:\"Per Adonai Eloim, Adonai Jehova,Adonai Sabaoth, Metraton On Agla Mathon,verbum pythonicum, mysterium salamandrae,conventus sylvorum, antra gnomorum,daemonia Coeli Gad, Almousin, Gibor, Jehosua,Evam, Zariatnatmik, veni, veni, veni.\"      This had been going on for two hours without change or intermission when over all the neighbourhood a pandaemoniac howling of dogs set in. The extent of this howling can be judged from the space it received in the papers the next day, but to those in the Ward household it was overshadowed by the odour which instantly followed it; a hideous, all-pervasive odour which none of them had ever smelt before or have ever smelt since. In the midst of this mephitic flood there came a very perceptible flash like that of lightning, which would have been blinding and impressive but for the daylight around; and then was heard the voice that no listener can ever forget because of its thunderous remoteness, its incredible depth, and its eldritch dissimilarity to Charles Wards voice. It shook the house, and was clearly heard by at least two neighbours above the howling of the dogs. Mrs. Ward, who had been listening in despair outside her sons locked laboratory, shivered as she recognised its hellish import; for Charles had told her of its evil fame in dark books, and of the manner in which it had thundered, according to the Fenner letters, above the doomed Pawtuxet farmhouse on the night of Joseph Curwens annihilation. There was no mistaking that nightmare phrase, for Charles had described it too vividly in the old days when he had talked frankly of his Curwen investigations. And yet it was only this fragment of an archaic and forgotten language: \"DIES MIES JESCHET BOENE DOESEF DOUVEMA ENITEMAUS\".      Close upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening of the daylight, though sunset was still an hour distant, and then a puff of added odour different from the first but equally unknown and intolerable. Charles was chanting again now and his mother could hear syllables that sounded like \"Yi-nash-Yog-Sothoth-he-lgeb-fi-throdog\" - ending in a \"Yah!\" whose maniacal force mounted in an ear-splitting crescendo. A second later all previous memories were effaced by the wailing scream which burst out with frantic explosiveness and gradually changed form to a paroxysm of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Mrs. Ward, with the mingled fear and blind courage of maternity, advanced and knocked affrightedly at the concealing panels, but obtained no sign of recognition. She knocked again, but paused nervelessly as a second shriek arose, this one unmistakably in the familiar voice of her son, and sounding concurrently with the still bursting cachinnations of that other voice. Presently she fainted, although she is still unable to recall the precise and immediate cause. Memory sometimes makes merciful deletions.      Mr. Ward returned from the business section at about quarter past six; and not finding his wife downstairs, was told by the frightened servants that she was probably watching at Charless door, from which the sounds had been far stranger than ever before. Mounting the stairs at once, he saw Mrs. Ward stretched at full length on the floor of the corridor outside the laboratory; and realising that she had fainted, hastened to fetch a glass of water from a set bowl in a neighbouring alcove. Dashing the cold fluid in her face, he was heartened to observe an immediate response on her part, and was watching the bewildered opening of her eyes when a chill shot through him and threatened to reduce him to the very state from which she was emerging. For the seemingly silent laboratory was not as silent as it had appeared to be, but held the murmurs of a tense, muffled conversation in tones too low for comprehension, yet of a quality profoundly disturbing to the soul.      It was not, of course, new for Charles to mutter formulae; but this muttering was definitely different. It was so palpably a dialogue, or imitation of a dialogue, with the regular alteration of inflections suggesting question and answer, statement and response. One voice was undisguisedly that of Charles, but the other had a depth and hollowness which the youths best powers of ceremonial mimicry had scarcely approached before. There was something hideous, blasphemous, and abnormal about it, and but for a cry from his recovering wife which cleared his mind by arousing his protective instincts it is not likely that Theodore Howland Ward could have maintained for nearly a year more his old boast that he had never fainted. As it was, he seized his wife in his arms and bore her quickly downstairs before she could notice the voices which had so horribly disturbed him. Even so, however, he was not quick enough to escape catching something himself which caused him to stagger dangerously with his burden. For Mrs. Wards cry had evidently been heard by others than he, and there had come from behind the locked door the first distinguishable words which that masked and terrible colloquy had yielded. They were merely an excited caution in Charless own voice, but somehow their implications held a nameless fright for the father who overheard them. The phrase was just this: \"Sshh! - write!\"      Mr. and Mrs. Ward conferred at some length after dinner, and the former resolved to have a firm and serious talk with Charles that very night. No matter how important the object, such conduct could no longer be permitted; for these latest developments transcended every limit of sanity and formed a menace to the order and nervous well-being of the entire household. The youth must indeed have taken complete leave of his senses, since only downright madness could have prompted the wild screams and imaginary conversations in assumed voices which the present day had brought forth. All this must be stopped, or Mrs. Ward would be made ill and the keeping of servants become an impossibility.      Mr. Ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for Charless laboratory. On the third floor, however, he paused at the sounds which he heard proceeding from the now disused library of his son. Books were apparently being flung about and papers wildly rustled, and upon stepping to the door Mr. Ward beheld the youth within, excitedly assembling a vast armful of literary matter of every size and shape. Charless aspect was very drawn and haggard, and he dropped his entire load with a start at the sound of his fathers voice. At the elder mans command he sat down, and for some time listened to the admonitions he had so long deserved. There was no scene. At the end of the lecture he agreed that his father was right, and that his noises, mutterings, incantations, and chemical odours were indeed inexcusable nuisances. He agreed to a policy of greater quiet, though insisting on a prolongation of his extreme privacy. Much of his future work, he said, was in any case purely book research; and he could obtain quarters elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be necessary at a later stage. For the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed the keenest contrition, and explained that the conversation later heard was part of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental atmosphere. His use of abstruse technical terms somewhat bewildered Mr. Ward, but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and poise despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity. The interview was really quite inconclusive, and as Charles picked up his armful and left the room Mr. Ward hardly knew what to make of the entire business. It was as mysterious as the death of poor old Nig, whose stiffening form had been found an hour before in the basement, with staring eyes and fear-distorted mouth.      Driven by some vague detective instinct, the bewildered parent now glanced curiously at the vacant shelves to see what his son had taken up to the attic. The youths library was plainly and rigidly classified, so that one might tell at a glance the books or at least the kind of books which had been withdrawn. On this occasion Mr. Ward was astonished to find that nothing of the occult or the antiquarian, beyond what had been previously removed, was missing. These new withdrawals were all modern items; histories, scientific treatises, geographies, manuals of literature, philosophic works, and certain contemporary newspapers and magazines. It was a very curious shift from Charles Wards recent run of reading, and the father paused in a growing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense of strangeness. The strangeness was a very poignant sensation, and almost clawed at his chest as he strove to see just what was wrong around him. Something was indeed wrong, and tangibly as well as spiritually so. Ever since he had been in this room he had known that something was amiss, and at last it dawned upon him what it was.      On the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the house in Olney Court, but to the cracked and precariously restored oils of the large Curwen portrait disaster had come. Time and unequal heating had done their work at last, and at some time since the rooms last cleaning the worst had happened. Peeling clear of the wood, curling tighter and tighter, and finally crumbling into small bits with what must have been malignly silent suddenness, the portrait of Joseph Curwen had resigned forever its staring surveillance of the youth it so strangely resembled, and now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust.", "April 20th, 1909They have given me one hour to record my thoughts. Whether this be mercy or mockery, I know not. It seems at this point to be a matter of perspective and to their vision I cannot speak. They are among us and yet beyond us.My name, my true name, the name given to me by my mother on the day of my birth is Henry Davis Johnstone. Though by the time this is read there will be no memory of my being. And despite this note being written behind the ancient granite walls of Arkham Sanitarium believe that its author is not mad!I was mad. Even from birth I was stricken with a distinct melancholia, which puzzled doctors and strained the frail spirits of my parents. As I grew, the condition only worsened and my days as a schoolboy were marked with despondency and torpor. A fog of weariness touched all who came near and people hastily learned to avoid my influence.When it came time for me to move to higher education my father insisted I attend the local school, Miskatonic University, I suspect more out of frugality than to keep me near by need of fondness. My days as a college man were fraught with abject isolation. No field of study could hold my attention and no sport nor society could capture my interest. I had no friends and certainly no prospects for marriage.It came to pass that while arriving late to lecture on English literature of the sixteenth century I took the notice of a pompous and sarcastic professor. Seeing my black dress and sullen expression, he raised his arms like a dramatist and pronounced, Why look, class! Look at this young agelast. It be Hamlet the Dane, here in the flesh. Tell me, Prince, hast thou yet taken thy revenge gainst thy lecherous uncle Claudius?\"The students erupted in vexatious laughter. I was overcome, and I speedily exited the hall in search of some well-shadowed place. From then on, my peers knew me as Hamlet and murmured to each other in jest whenever I passed.I cannot recall the moment when my affliction grew from a simple eccentricity into a state of illness. The shift was slow and subtle. At the end of my second year at Miskatonic, the student liaison sat with me and I was informed that due to my abysmal student record and obvious aprosexia I was not welcome to attend the institute next semester. The only response I could muster was an impotent shrug. The news was not shocking, though I had desperately wished my case and I might escape the notice of the office staff. With a feeble groan, I lifted myself from my seat and began the way back to my fathers house. The journey was hardly laborious for we lived on Parsonage Street, within two miles of the school. But on that day I was drowned with fatigue. My legs were young and strong but I hadnt the volition to operate them.A schoolfellow found me the following afternoon lying in the shade of an apple tree. My memory of this event is vague and distant, suffering from the fugue in which I was held. The student who came to my aid (his name eludes me) was a graduate student in the competitive and arduous field of theoretical physics and had been witness to more than one mental lapse in his peers. He recognized my condition immediately and brought me directly to the colleges school of psychology.It took no more than a moment for those learned men to spot the illness in my mind. A simple exchange determined the path of my life for the next six years. I was bound for extended occupancy at Arkham Sanitarium.There are some who fear the sanatorium. One can hardly forget tales of Bedlam or Goyas images of poor idiots in torment. No doubt, such madhouses exist where callous professionals employ bizarre and deleterious procedures on the hapless lunatics in their care. But I found my hospital to be a different experience entirely. Here was a sanctum in the old tradition where mercy to the sick was put above the aggressive meddling of the analysts. This was my habernacle. My even disposition and independence swiftly earned me friends among the staff. And in the company of disruptive neurotics, my draining influence was taken as a blessing.Not to say I was left deserted - far from it. The doctors prescribed various laetificants, exposure to direct sunlight, massage, mineral baths, invigorating emollients and agents to thicken the blood. And as each therapy failed, as they all failed, they did not lose heart. They patiently and methodically exhausted every curative known to science.I was neither bitter at medicines inability to improve my condition nor at fortune for my having been born so feeble of will. Does a slug look to the gleeful hummingbird with envy? I was born a slug and I say it does not.As you might imagine, time passed uneventfully. Now and then, a doctor might remark that some advancement had been made in the medical community that might make the difference in my case. We would attempt the regimen and it would eventually prove ineffective. This continued for five long years until the arrival of the two men who led me to this fate. Two men who, due to my impending executioners, never existed.The first was Professor Adam Wayland Erikson, a graduate of Bute Medical School and honoured fellow of the Royal College of Physicians who served a lengthy internship under renowned patient advocate Sir John Charles Bucknill. I presume Dr. Bucknill still exists in memory. But how can I know? Maybe my life has descended into phantasm and this account is worthless. Or perhaps they will sweep this note into oblivion with the rest of my existence.That is enough of that. I have much to record and time is short. Suffice it to say that on a tour of American asylums Dr. Erikson was charmed and delighted by Arkhams facilities and benevolent ideology. He immediately appealed for a position at the institute and was accepted heartily.The good doctor brought with him the second man I know to be lost. Introduced to me as Mr. Sean Jones, a Welshman who was afflicted with mental disturbances reportedly so peculiar that Dr. Erikson devoted his life to the case. Seans family had spent the better part of the Georgian Era in the vilest but most lucrative acts of piracy. He had been born into substantial wealth but with such a nefarious family reputation that it was difficult to enjoy.As we were housed in rooms across the hall, were of similar age, and because we both understood what it was to be an outsider, Mr. Jones and I became quick friends. And that connection proved to be mutually beneficial. Whereas I was bound by lethargy, half-dead as some described me, my comrade was bursting with energy, a tireless maelstrom of activity. I found his company energizing and to him I was a source of calmness and rest.He confided in me, overflowing with stories of his ancestors terrible deeds and of their pact with dark powers hidden to mankind by the oceans depths. All sailors know to respect the guiding stars but only a few are privy to their secrets. Sean relayed to me in great detail the lessons in sabaism taught to him by his father. He spoke of worlds beyond where abnormous creatures harnessed dark energies so powerful that their influence could be felt here on earth. This was why, he claimed, he had caught the interest of Dr. Erikson. Not for his psychopathology but for the eldritch wisdom he had acquired in his life as a degenerate mystic.Though Seans charisma tempted me to believe him, his story was too fantastic to trust even the smallest detail. He was, after all, a madman. I continued to listen with interest but I was convinced I was audience to an elaborate fiction.Then it came that I was sitting with Dr. Erikson for a monthly interview and assessment. The doctor noted that I had been spending much of my time speaking with Sean and he inquired into the nature of our conversations. At first, I hesitated. My instinct was to misreport the wild stories out of loyalty to my friend. But reason led me to deduce that candour would best serve his treatment. I explained all I understood of what I had been told as precisely as I could.Erikson simply nodded and when I had finished he prepared for himself a cigarette.\"Hes a genius, you know,\" he said.I was astounded. It felt as if the floor was shifting beneath me.He continued: \"Sometime ago, I came across an article in the Journal of Mental Science entitled Oneiromancy as an Effect of Ferromagnetic Consequence. It was the most brilliant work I had ever seen. And it was submitted anonymously. I wanted desperately to contact the master behind the work but there were almost no leads.\"The doctor stared at the burning tip of his cigarette. I glanced about the room nervously.\"Sean was the author?\" I asked.\"It took me four years to find him. I followed a collection of academic treasures: medical research, historical treatises, mathematical proofs - even an English translation of the infamous Liber Damnatus. At the last, I bribed a courier to give up his secret employer. When he directed me to Denbigh Asylum, I assumed Id find my scholar amidst the staff. But there he was, locked away and heavily sedated. He had directed all of that magnificent research through intermediaries from a tiny cell. I swore at that moment both to heal him and learn from him.\"I couldnt have been more shocked. This tale seemed even less plausible than Seans wild accounts. A fear took me. I suspected that I had finally crossed into a realm of complete madness and unreality. But the doctor was not finished with me.\"Henry, I believe Sean and I have made a breakthrough. Its a radical procedure involving the surgical insertion of several rare earth magnets directly into the tissue of the brain. I have practised the operation on various animals and I am confident the procedure is sound. It follows logically that I begin human trials. The professionally responsible course of action would be to bring my findings to a university, but the theory behind our technique is so advanced it may take decades before our science is peer-approved. And the mystical nature of some of our discoveries will be easy sport for sceptics.Sean demands I perform the surgery on him. But you see, his mind, his metaphysical insight, is too precious to be lost to an experimental procedure. I am asking you, and it is a great deal to ask, to undergo the operation as a safety trial.\"My heart sank. I loved knowledge and cared for my friend. But surely this was insanity of the most outlandish variety.I inquired, \"What effect would a procedure designed for Seans brain have on my own?\"\"The operation would be adapted to suit your needs. Whereas Sean requires limiting and pacification, you need to be energized or awakened. Its a simple question of placing the magnets within different structures of the brain. Sean will determine the specifics.\"\"So this might possibly cure me?\" I asked.\"If our theories hold true you will see a miraculous increase in function. There is also a high risk that you will not survive.\"I could sense the doctors disappointment even before I spoke.\"I may be mad, but I have no wish to die. And this notion of health you offer is utterly alien to me. Who would be this happy man wearing my skin?\"Erikson replied, \"I am not ass enough to believe you enjoy your present condition.\"\"I accept my state of being and, more to the point, I identify with this way of life. This may be pitiful but it is my way. I refuse and that is my final word.\"He dismissed me with an understanding nod and I retired to the mineral baths. Their placid relaxation quickly blent away thoughts of experimental surgery. Before long, I could barely recall our conversation and considered the matter dealt with.Over the following week, I heard nothing of the subject. Sean kept away from me, I supposed to keep his dissatisfaction from affecting our friendship. I gave him a wide berth, confident he would surmount these feelings and soon all would be as it was. With time, Dr. Eriksons procedure would be approved by the medical community and he would have his cranial magnets.It was a cold and stirless night when he came to me. I was in my bed lost in dream when I was jerked awake. A drop of icy fluid trickled with precision into the canal of my ear. I flung myself from the bed in a chaotic motion. There, sitting peacefully, was Sean, his hands buried in the pockets of a heavy coat. I stood in puzzlement for on his face I saw neither malevolence nor jest. Indeed, the man before me was a portrait of repose.\"You will undergo the surgery,\" he said, looking blankly at the wall.It took me a moment to gather an answer. His disposition was so alien, his aspect so void.\"I will not. You are a dear friend, but dearer to me is my life.\"I had played tennis with Sean and I had run with him. To that point, I thought I possessed an understanding of his physical abilities. He was a slight man, no doubt the product of his overactive metabolism. But the speed with which he captured me and the strength with which he held his ether rag over my nose and mouth were simply astounding. I held my breath as best I could, but there was no escape. He had me locked like a master wrestler with an intensity reserved for the mad.As I faded, he spoke to me: \"The Powers mock me for having been born a mortal of an insignificant species. They bar me from the Dreamlands and laugh at my ambitions. But I know my power and I know my worth. I promise you, my friend, you shall be cured and soon after, I shall be delivered my mind in full. The knowledge of Pnakotus will I take and it shall lead me to Kadath in the Cold Waste. When I have conquered there the Gods will be compelled to honour me with a place in the Court of Azathoth at the centre of all things.\"I awoke in the sanatoriums infirmary, my head aching and bandaged like a mummy. All things seemed distant and unreal, no doubt from the powerful opiates they administered to me. Dr. Erikson came to observe later on that first day of my awakening. In my heart, I wished to cry out that he was a ruthless butcher, but in my state I did not possess the power of speech. And so I lay dazedly while he prodded at me with arcane devices. I even heard him remark that I was progressing well and that he was now confident enough to operate on Jones. The only action I could muster was a low groan.Soon after the doctor left, darkness took me and I slept for two more days. When I awoke on that third day it was to an awakening beyond that which any man before has had. For no one before me could have leapt from the pure anhedonia in which I was lost into the ripe fullness of living wonder I now experience. Still unconscious, I rose from my bed and wandered into the being of this new existence. It wasnt until a nurse found me mumbling in the garden that I finally awoke in full. Her grip on my arm was tight and yet wondrous, the pressure of each of her digits a new universe of interest. I could feel the twist and sway of every hair on my body. And what is more, I could concentrate and remember their feeling. For the first time in all my life, I began to understand what it was to be alive. Still in that transcendent moment, I remembered the awful state of things.\"Where is Sean?\" I asked.\"Wanted to wish your friend luck, did you? Im sorry, Henry, you just missed him. He entered surgery a few minutes ago.\"I rushed away at that second, for the clarity offered me by my newfound mind led me to dark conclusions. Sean Jones was not undergoing this surgery to alleviate madness but to unleash the full psychic potential of his diseased mind! What horrific consequences this might have on mankind I could not say. It seemed entirely possible that he could alter the shape of time and space not only in this universe but also beyond.I dashed through the halls of the sanatorium to the operating theatre and burst in.It appears my time has almost run out. I must be brief. This situation suits me fine as human language fails in describing what occurred next.In the operating room, I found Dr. Erikson, Sean and three humanoid figures caught in conversation. The creatures were uniformly tall, at least six feet, and utterly, completely featureless. They were smooth and indistinct, like matte cloth, and were completely motionless. Though they did not speak, I could feel their intelligence within the recesses of my own mind. They exuded no mood, feeling or character that I could discern but the presence of their psyches was profoundly apparent. No sooner had I entered than Sean and the doctor faded from existence. Right before my eyes, they shifted from being to nothingness in a slow gradient. I turned to run.\"Do not flee,\" said a voice that came from, or perhaps through, one of the alien figures.\"What have you done?\" I asked.\"The one had designs against one of our realities, the other an unwitting accomplice. They were, are, and ever shall be no more. To this end you too shall pass.\"My chest heaved with panic. Unlike any other time in my memory, I did not doubt my senses in this circumstance. These beings are truer than what sane men call reality. They are beyond it.And I said, \"Ive done nothing wrong.\"\"Your mind has been awoken. This will not be tolerated. The mere fact that you are capable of this exchange means you must be undone.\"I argued with those beings, but to no avail. We spent a great deal of time in communication and I have learned things I thought no man would ever discover. And woe befalls me for having this knowledge. I havent even the means to record here the details. There simply are no words.They sent me here to my room with the specific instruction to compose a note detailing the situation. I cannot guess their intent.I see by my bedside clock that my time is short. All that remains, I guess, is to bestow some moral on my tale.Perhaps sometime in the future a reader is thinking, \"Was your restoration worth the fate that befell you?\"To him, I can only reply that exp[note ends]"]}
{"id": "EN026", "pair": ["Heavens not enoughIf when Im there I dont remember you...The words came unbidden to Torren-Wraeths mind. The line was from an old song from the soundtrack of an old Japanese anime that had confused and depressed the hell out of him. He shook his head, Heavens Not Enough, Steve Conte, Wolfs Rain soundtrack, No... there had been two soundtracks for that series, this was the first song on the second. Why wasnt it called Wolves Rain? He thought, trying to dispel the sad song, but it played on, and he was even singing softly toward the songs end...Cause I couldnt cryCause I turned awayCouldnt see the scoreDidnt know the painOf leaving yesterday really far behindin another lifein another dreamBy a different namegave it all away for a memory and a quiet lieand I felt the face Of the cold tonightStill dont know the scoreBut I know the painOf leaving everything really far behind ...Thus distracted, he did not see Dahlman.The sorcerer was a servant of the He Who Gnaws in The Darkness. Azathoth was neither ally nor enemy to Cthulhu, he was actually his Great-Grandfather having sired both Yog-Sothoth and Shub-Niggurath, who had sired Nug and Yeb, Nug being Cthulhus parent by parthogenesis. Azathoths worshipers, however, tended to be madmen in the truest sense. He was a mindless entity, neither desiring nor rewarding worship. Some of the gods who danced round and round his throne often took it upon themselves to accept his worship and grant gifts in his behalf. Especially Nyarlathotep...The Outer Gods were the key. Humans were a weak species, helpless in the face of even the least of The Great Old Ones. But by learning, by studying the Outer Gods, by utilizing their power, a human could assume a form of divinity themselves. For decades Dahlman had faithfully studied the ancient texts, The Book of Eibon, The Necronomicon, The Book of Iod, and he had learned to harness the power of those who lurked mindless and blind beyond the thin veil of reality. And now he would prove his worth, he would bring down an immortal, the child of a god...A bolt of lightning shook Torren-Wraeth from his revery, it barely hurt, but he could tell it was not natural. He turned to see a black-clad figuring closing in upon him, and erected a Deflect Harm even as the human struck out with Fist of Yog-Sothoth. \"Okay, now youre annoying me.\" Torren-Wraeth lashed out with Implant Fear, hoping to avoid having to actually kill this irrational attacker. He disliked sorcerers, but he also disliked having to harm people. But the madman had cast Deflect Harm upon himself, and, thus protected, struck back with The Dread Curse of Azathoth. Torren-Wraeth reeled, Now that hurt! Enraged, Torren-Wraeth physically rushed the sorcerer, ignoring the protective amulet the man held out, and punched him square in the nose, breaking it. Distracted by the pain, Dahlman fell before Implant Fear.Dahlmans mind was instantly overwhelmed with unimaginable fear and he turned to flee, all spells forgotten in his terror, only to run into a golden monstrosity streaking toward him in the dawning sky. He called frantically upon his gods to save him. But these were not benevolent gods, they were fickle, and enjoyed granting lesser beings great power, just to have the pleasure of snatching it away. His gods deserted him mid-flight, his skin shriveled and shrank tight against his bones as he aged in seconds. The capricious Outer Gods no doubt laughed as their former ward fell into the sea, and was immediately set upon by sharks.Torren-Wraeth and Tek watched impassively as the dying sorcerer fell into the sea.\"Who was that?\"\"I have no idea.\"\"And I thought you were in trouble.\"\"Sorry.\"\"You do get in the strangest situations.\" Tek observed wryly.\"Sorry.\"Youve made me late, you know.\"\"Sorry about that.\"\"Its okay, I could use the break. A word of advice, never marry a woman with five mouths.\"Both Tek and Torren-Wraeth laughed.Ho Fong arched an eyebrow as he saw the disheveled Torren-Wraeth accompanying Lord Tektaktequataquarl. Hed seen him before, of course, he occasionally visited alongside Tek, though his distaste for the ritual sacrifices of human beings was clearly evident. Fortunately, no such events were scheduled. \"Are you alright, Lord Torren-Wraeth?\" He knew better than to call him simply Torren or Wraeth. \"Ill be all right, Master Ho,\" Torren-Wraeth said with perfect Chinese courtesy, \"But I would be most grateful for a place to rest for a while.\" Ho Fong smiled, \"Of course,\" he turned, \"Ping, take lord Torren-Wraeth to one of the guest areas and provide him with whatever refreshments he requires.\" A youngish monk, dressed in the standard yellow and black silk, stepped forward and led Torren-Wraeth deeper into the monastery.It was instantly obvious to Torren-Wraeth that Ping was not Chinese, at least, not in the ethnic sense. He was one of the dreaded Tcho-Tcho people, descendants of toad-like creatures created by the Great Old One Chaugnar Faugn and human cultists. The Tcho-Tcho had an evil reputation, one well earned. The vast majority of them served the Great Old Ones, and many practiced cannibalism. There were exceptions, of course, not all Tcho-Tcho were evil or insane, but those individuals were usually outcasts, hated and sometimes even hunted by their own people. As they walked, Torren-Wraeth halted for a moment before an idol of carved black stone. It was well-crafted and incredibly detailed, lean muscled and lanky, wings extended, the webbed hands held palm up like a divine supplicant, the curving trunk-mouth lifted upward as if it were sounding a call. A call to Death itself, for this was Shugoran, The Herald of Death, worshiped and feared by the Tcho-Tcho people. Ping knelt reverently then hurried Torren-Wraeth into a nearby chamber.The scent of Black Lotus was thick in the air as the monks shut the great copper door behind Tek. \"You really shouldnt smoke you know,\" he said casually, \"Terrible for the lungs...\" The Bloated Woman rose from her cushions, \"Only if you are a mortal, which I am not.\" Tek smiled, then shed his semblance of humanity, becoming a writhing, shapeless mass of golden flesh, golden tentacles, golden eyes and pearly white fangs. \"What of our child?\" Several mouths spoke at once. The Goddess came closer with a grace unfitting such an obese creature. \"Nothing can harm our offspring.\" \"How long, do you think?\" The Bloated Woman stopped, apparently this visit was for business, not pleasure. \"It is impossible to tell. I have born some children within days of conception, and others within centuries.\" She sensed a slight jealous possessiveness on the part of the Hastur-Spawn, he wanted her as his sole mate, an amusing and archaic notion, not often seen in a True-Blood. The fact that he knew she had devoured most of the former lovers did not apparently assuage this unseemly feeling. \"I feel that this one will be born within a month or two...\" She grinned horribly with all five mouths, \"How has your father reacted?\" \"Our child will be welcome in Carcosa.\" Hastur, in truth, was somewhat worried, fearing that the child would be another avatar of Nyarlathotep, that the Crawling Chaos would use the child as yet another form in which to manifest itself. In other words, he feared that Nyarlathotep would give birth to itself...For all the vile practices that went on in the Monastery of The Bloated Woman, it was a beautiful place, richly decorated in jade and silver, gold and silk. Yellow and black, every strand of silk in the monastery was either yellow or black. The yellow made for a much friendlier environment than the dark, ominous stones of RLyeh. The Goddess favored those colors, for some reason. Torren-Wraeth remembered something Goro had once said. Among his people and several other Asian cultures, yellow was the color of mourning. Black meant death and mourning in the West, yellow filled that role in the East. Was it intentional? Probably, but he was a guest, and it would be rude to question his hosts. He changed from his slightly charred clothing into the yellow and black robes that had been kindly provided him and stepped out into the hallway. There he saw Ping once again kneeling before Shugoran.", "\"Great Cthulhu looks favorably upon your sacrifices.\" Torren-Wraeth swept his arms expansively before the congregation, \"And your faith pleases him greatly.\" He had been summoned, he hated being summoned, but it was his duty. \"What is your desire?\" A fire blazed on the stone alter behind him, and dark-robed humans knelt before the child of their god as a tentacular, vaguely toad-like being known colloquially as a \"Servitor of the Outer Gods\", (His personal name was Grix), piped away on a bone flute. The High Priest, distinguished by his rich green robes, stood, \"We seeketh only a small boon from thy sire.\" Torren-Wraeth rolled his eyes mentally, why did humans always use that annoying Archaic English in religious rights. Cthulhu didnt speak English, let alone Ye Olde English. \"What is it?\" The priest then began a short list of needs, more game to hunt, more rain for the crops, as if Cthulhu could magically make them appear. Well, he could make rain, at least, but not animals... Animal life had flourished since The Great Arising, with so few humans left to hunt them, these people had probably been careless, overtaxing their resources...\"Rain will not be a problem,\" Torren-Wraeth said confidently, then, \"But animals and good crops are more in the domain of Shub-Niggurath.\" Grix stopped piping and eyed Torren-Wraeth in surprise. The priest looked confused, the congregation certainly was. \"Canst thou not aid us?\" Torren-Wraeth considered for a moment, Cthulhu could drive animals toward this village, but could he make crops grow? \"He can send rain and more game animals for you to hunt, but as for the growing of crops, you will likely have to either trust your luck or make sacrifices to Cernunos.\" That avatar of Shub-Niggurath was closely associated with agriculture, and Cthulhu didnt mind sharing his worshipers. Torren-Wraeth knew of one god he didnt want the people to follow, however. \"And by The Key and The Gate dont start worshiping He-Who-Walks-Between-the-Rows!\" Lightning struck near the entrance of the church, fusing sand to glass, \"If you sacrifice to him, Ill kill you all myself!\" The congregation recoiled in terror. A steady rain began to fall outside the church. The congregation, forgetting their confusing, terrifying angel, and went wild. \"PRAISE CTHULHU!\" \"IA! IA! CTHULHU NAFLFHTAGN!\"Great Cthulhu held court from his green-black graven throne in the Temple of The Key and The Gate. Though many worshiped him as a god or feared him as a devil, the Lord of RLyeh was in truth a high priest of Yog-Sothoth. Not that he discouraged his own worship, even as his own clerics, Father Dagon and Mother Hydra, gladly accepted the worshipful adulation of the lesser races. There were plenty of eager and fearful acolytes for everyone.Later, after the humans had all driven or drunken themselves into noisy slumber, Grix rolled over to Torren-Wraeth, who sat cross-legged and disgusted on the cold stone floor. \"Your father may not be pleased that you shattered his image of omnipotence.\" \"Should I give these people lies?\" Torren-Wraeth spoke freely, no one there but the two of them understood Grix tongue. Grix laughed, a peculiar gurgling sound, \"Isnt it all a lie, in the end? You made it rain, not your father. I could have, too, if I had wanted.\" Torren-Wraeth sighed, not knowing how to respond, then took the pipe from Grix slimy tentacles and began to play.Torren-Wraeth had some friends and allies, human or otherwise. Tektaktequataquarl, a True-Blood Hastur-Spawn. An unlikely friend, certainly, as Hastur and Cthulhu were grave enemies, and Hasturs Spawn were no more given to emotion in any human standard than those of his nemesis. Tek was an exception, wild, emotional, maybe even a little bit crazy, even by the standards of The King in Tatters. He took human form, male, beautiful, gold skin and gleaming wings, though in truth he was a hermaphroditic golden mass of flesh, tendrils, eyes and mouths. As Hastur-Spawn, he was unwelcome in Cthulhus court, but he ignored the threats with the casual indifference of an immortal, perhaps he even found a perverse pleasure in visiting enemy territory. Besides, his mate, the Bloated Woman, also known as the Goddess of the Black Fan, lived in the mountains of China. Seven feet tall, six hundred pounds of blubber and writhing tendrils topped with five vicious mouths and a pair of exquisitely beautiful eyes. When holding the Black Fan under her eyes, she was slim and beautiful, a mask for luring men to a gruesome death. Ironically, Tek found the true form more appealing, a form so similar to his own... Regardless, Cthulhu would never dare move against her, for The Bloated Woman was an avatar of the only being Cthulhu truly feared, Nyarlathotep. To anger Nyarlathotep meant horrors even Great Cthulhu dare not imagine. Torren-Wraeth did not care much for the cruel Goddess, but, in some strange way, Tek loved her. Torren-Wraeth had no way of knowing if the feeling was reciprocated, one never knew with The Crawling Chaos...Then there were the Insects from Shaggai, who had dwelt in Englands Severn valley for centuries, repairing their temple-ship. They brought with them their experiences, their dreams and nightmares of far-off wonders; The cities of long-dead Shaggai, the titanic natives of Thuggon, of Lghhx, Xiclotl and Tond. They had finally escaped earth shortly before The Great Arising. They had been cruel and twisted beings, but living their mortal memories made Torren-Wraeth long to visit these worlds, where eyeless giants strode teeming marshes and suns blazed black in amber skies. He sometimes used his skills at bending space and reality to take brief jaunts to these worlds. But he always came back. He could not seem to break earths hold on him, the ties of birth and blood were too strong.In his house at RLyeh Torren-Wraeth slept poorly. His home, small by Cthuli standards, was the size of a cathedral, one large room with a stone bed covered by warm blankets and a square, shallow pool of flowing seawater that served as a bath. A low stone shelf held an image of Goro, preserved forever beneath unbreakable, transparent alien stone. Several books, scrolls and tablets lay scattered about, and the room, from floor to ceiling, was covered with elaborate carvings of alien worlds and incredible creatures. A grim looking Moai sat in a corner, looking out over the green-black structure. A small chest of amber-colored stone, strongly contrasting the general color scheme, held Torren-Wraeths clothing.He rose from his bed and walked across the cool floor to the open portal, staring out at the fickle stars that flickered in the night sky. Isnt it all a lie in the end? He sighed, then turned to the chest and began to dress.Ho Fong stood at the gates of the Monastery of The Bloated Woman, catching the first rays of sunlight. He was old, centuries had passed since he became high priest of The Order of The Bloated Woman, yet time held no power over him. He appeared to be in his early fifties, without even a gray hair. Someone, an American, no doubt, had once insultingly compared him to the fictional Chinese villain Fu Manchu. In truth, he did resemble a significantly heavier version of the Devil Doctor, complete with the signature moustache. Hed killed the man, of course. The Goddess required sacrifices, after all. As the golden light began to bath the magnificent mountains of China in divine splendor, he thought about The Other. He did not worship lord Tektaktequataquarl, as he didnt seem to desire worship, but was obliged to give him all due respect as the Goddess consort. Tek was coming, of course. The only constant in that being of chaos life was his love for the Goddess, a love Ho Fong envied, though he could never bring himself to admit it. He straightened his yellow and black silk robes, the official garb of the Order, and prepared to greet the Hastur-Spawn.The monastery was fairly new, The Order had once had centers in Shanghai and on Gray Dragon Island, but these had been lost in 1926. Enemies of The Order had overwhelmed and destroyed them. Much had been lost, and Ho Fong himself had nearly been killed. These had been powerful setbacks, but, in the end, they had been immaterial, as both Shanghai and Gray Dragon Island now lay lost beneath the waves. Ho Fongs enemies, The Goddess enemies, were all long dead. He walked back into the monastery, passing lesser monks and acolytes who bowed dutifully toward him, and approached the great bronze doors behind which the Goddess rested. Two burly monks opened the doors and Ho Fong respectfully approached the screens of yellow and black silk that lay beyond the carven jade sacrificial alter.The Bloated Woman sat upon a pile of silken cushions, smoking essence of Black Lotus from an ornate hookah, its pipe in her third mouth. The Black Fan and six sacred golden sickles, used to dispatch human sacrifices, hung from a black silk sash wrapped around her prodigious belly. The priest bowed deeply to his beloved Goddess. \"He will not be here for some time yet.\" The Goddess voice was smooth and sultry. \"Receive him warmly.\" She blew fragrantly scented smoke from her fourth mouth, whilst speaking through her second and first.Tektaktequataquarl flapped his gleaming wings in the bright morning sun. He felt Torren-Wraeths approach long before he could see him. He was a good kid, level-headed and thoughtful, the total opposite of Tek himself. Perhaps that was why he liked him, a balance of chaos and order. Yin and Yang, so to speak. Ever since his human confidant had died, the Half-Blood had become more sullen and withdrawn. He needed more excitement in his life. Perhaps Tek himself needed less, courting an avatar of Nyarlathotep. Even Hastur had expressed concern about that union, but love is blind. She was evil, in human terms, but, then again, by human terms she was hideous. He found her beautiful and dangerous. He wondered what their coming offspring would be like...He suddenly realized something had changed. Torren-Wraeth was in trouble, his life was in danger. He turned back and sped toward the Half-Blood..."]}

A Result and a Prologue1.From a private hospital for the insane near Providence, Rhode Island, there recently disappeared an exceedingly singular person. He bore the name of Charles Dexter Ward, and was placed under restraint most reluctantly by the grieving father who had watched his aberration grow from a mere eccentricity to a dark mania involving both a possibility of murderous tendencies and a profound and peculiar change in the apparent contents of his mind. Doctors confess themselves quite baffled by his case, since it presented oddities of a general physiological as well as psychological character.      In the first place, the patient seemed oddly older than his twenty-six years would warrant. Mental disturbance, it is true, will age one rapidly; but the face of this young man had taken on a subtle cast which only the very aged normally acquire. In the second place, his organic processes shewed a certain queerness of proportion which nothing in medical experience can parallel. Respiration and heart action had a baffling lack of symmetry; the voice was lost, so that no sounds above a whisper were possible; digestion was incredibly prolonged and minimised, and neural reactions to standard stimuli bore no relation at all to anything heretofore recorded, either normal or pathological. The skin had a morbid chill and dryness, and the cellular structure of the tissue seemed exaggeratedly coarse and loosely knit. Even a large olive birthmark on the right hip had disappeared, whilst there had formed on the chest a very peculiar mole or blackish spot of which no trace existed before. In general, all physicians agree that in Ward the processes of metabolism had become retarded to a degree beyond precedent.      Psychologically, too, Charles Ward was unique. His madness held no affinity to any sort recorded in even the latest and most exhaustive of treatises, and was conjoined to a mental force which would have made him a genius or a leader had it not been twisted into strange and grotesque forms. Dr. Willett, who was Wards family physician, affirms that the patients gross mental capacity, as gauged by his response to matters outside the sphere of his insanity, had actually increased since the seizure. Ward, it is true, was always a scholar and an antiquarian; but even his most brilliant early work did not shew the prodigious grasp and insight displayed during his last examinations by the alienists. It was, indeed, a difficult matter to obtain a legal commitment to the hospital, so powerful and lucid did the youths mind seem; and only on the evidence of others, and on the strength of many abnormal gaps in his stock of information as distinguished from his intelligence, was he finally placed in confinement. To the very moment of his vanishment he was an omnivorous reader and as great a conversationalist as his poor voice permitted; and shrewd observers, failing to foresee his escape, freely predicted that he would not be long in gaining his discharge from custody.      Only Dr. Willett, who brought Charles Ward into the world and had watched his growth of body and mind ever since, seemed frightened at the thought of his future freedom. He had had a terrible experience and had made a terrible discovery which he dared not reveal to his sceptical colleagues. Willett, indeed, presents a minor mystery all his own in his connexion with the case. He was the last to see the patient before his flight, and emerged from that final conversation in a state of mixed horror and relief which several recalled when Wards escape became known three hours later. That escape itself is one of the unsolved wonders of Dr. Waites hospital. A window open above a sheer drop of sixty feet could hardly explain it, yet after that talk with Willett the youth was undeniably gone. Willett himself has no public explanations to offer, though he seems strangely easier in mind than before the escape. Many, indeed, feel that he would like to say more if he thought any considerable number would believe him. He had found Ward in his room, but shortly after his departure the attendants knocked in vain. When they opened the door the patient was not there, and all they found was the open window with a chill April breeze blowing in a cloud of fine bluish-grey dust that almost choked them. True, the dogs howled some time before; but that was while Willett was still present, and they had caught nothing and shewn no disturbance later on. Wards father was told at once over the telephone, but he seemed more saddened than surprised. By the time Dr. Waite called in person, Dr. Willett had been talking with him, and both disavowed any knowledge or complicity in the escape. Only from certain closely confidential friends of Willett and the senior Ward have any clues been gained, and even these are too wildly fantastic for general credence. The one fact which remains is that up to the present time no trace of the missing madman has been unearthed.      Charles Ward was an antiquarian from infancy, no doubt gaining his taste from the venerable town around him, and from the relics of the past which filled every corner of his parents old mansion in Prospect Street on the crest of the hill. With the years his devotion to ancient things increased; so that history, genealogy, and the study of colonial architecture, furniture, and craftsmanship at length crowded everything else from his sphere of interests. These tastes are important to remember in considering his madness; for although they do not form its absolute nucleus, they play a prominent part in its superficial form. The gaps of information which the alienists noticed were all related to modern matters, and were invariably offset by a correspondingly excessive though outwardly concealed knowledge of bygone matters as brought out by adroit questioning; so that one would have fancied the patient literally transferred to a former age through some obscure sort of auto-hypnosis. The odd thing was that Ward seemed no longer interested in the antiquities he knew so well. He had, it appears, lost his regard for them through sheer familiarity; and all his final efforts were obviously bent toward mastering those common facts of the modern world which had been so totally and unmistakably expunged from his brain. That this wholesale deletion had occurred, he did his best to hide; but it was clear to all who watched him that his whole programme of reading and conversation was determined by a frantic wish to imbibe such knowledge of his own life and of the ordinary practical and cultural background of the twentieth century as ought to have been his by virtue of his birth in 1902 and his education in the schools of our own time. Alienists are now wondering how, in view of his vitally impaired range of data, the escaped patient manages to cope with the complicated world of today; the dominant opinion being that he is lying low in some humble and unexacting position till his stock of modern information can be brought up to the normal.      The beginning of Wards madness is a matter of dispute among alienists. Dr. Lyman, the eminent Boston authority, places it in 1919 or 1920, during the boys last year at the Moses Brown School, when he suddenly turned from the study of the past to the study of the occult, and refused to qualify for college on the ground that he had individual researches of much greater importance to make. This is certainly borne out by Wards altered habits at the time, especially by his continual search through town records and among old burying-grounds for a certain grave dug in 1771; the grave of an ancestor named Joseph Curwen, some of whose papers he professed to have found behind the panelling of a very old house in Olney Court, on Stampers Hill, which Curwen was known to have built and occupied. It is, broadly speaking, undeniable that the winter of 1919-20 saw a great change in Ward; whereby he abruptly stopped his general antiquarian pursuits and embarked on a desperate delving into occult subjects both at home and abroad, varied only by this strangely persistent search for his forefathers grave.      From this opinion, however, Dr. Willett substantially dissents; basing his verdict on his close and continuous knowledge of the patient, and on certain frightful investigations and discoveries which he made toward the last. Those investigations and discoveries have left their mark upon him; so that his voice trembles when he tells them, and his hand trembles when he tries to write of them. Willett admits that the change of 1919-20 would ordinarily appear to mark the beginning of a progressive decadence which culminated in the horrible and uncanny alienation of 1928; but believes from personal observation that a finer distinction must be made. Granting freely that the boy was always ill-balanced temperamentally, and prone to be unduly susceptible and enthusiastic in his responses to phenomena around him, he refuses to concede that the early alteration marked the actual passage from sanity to madness; crediting instead Wards own statement that he had discovered or rediscovered something whose effect on human thought was likely to be marvellous and profound. The true madness, he is certain, came with a later change; after the Curwen portrait and the ancient papers had been unearthed; after a trip to strange foreign places had been made, and some terrible invocations chanted under strange and secret circumstances; after certain answers to these invocations had been plainly indicated, and a frantic letter penned under agonising and inexplicable conditions; after the wave of vampirism and the ominous Pawtuxet gossip; and after the patients memory commenced to exclude contemporary images whilst his voice failed and his physical aspect underwent the subtle modification so many subsequently noticed.      It was only about this time, Willett points out with much acuteness, that the nightmare qualities became indubitably linked with Ward; and the doctor feels shudderingly sure that enough solid evidence exists to sustain the youths claim regarding his crucial discovery. In the first place, two workmen of high intelligence saw Joseph Curwens ancient papers found. Secondly, the boy once shewed Dr. Willett those papers and a page of the Curwen diary, and each of the documents had every appearance of genuineness. The hole where Ward claimed to have found them was long a visible reality, and Willett had a very convincing final glimpse of them in surroundings which can scarcely be believed and can never perhaps be proved. Then there were the mysteries and coincidences of the Orne and Hutchinson letters, and the problem of the Curwen penmanship and of what the detectives brought to light about Dr. Allen; these things, and the terrible message in mediaeval minuscules found in Willetts pocket when he gained consciousness after his shocking experience.      And most conclusive of all, there are the two hideous results which the doctor obtained from a certain pair of formulae during his final investigations; results which virtually proved the authenticity of the papers and of their monstrous implications at the same time that those papers were borne forever from human knowledge.2.      One must look back at Charles Wards earlier life as at something belonging as much to the past as the antiquities he loved so keenly. In the autumn of 1918, and with a considerable show of zest in the military training of the period, he had begun his junior year at the Moses Brown School, which lies very near his home. The old main building, erected in 1819, had always charmed his youthful antiquarian sense; and the spacious park in which the academy is set appealed to his sharp eye for landscape. His social activities were few; and his hours were spent mainly at home, in rambling walks, in his classes and drills, and in pursuit of antiquarian and genealogical data at the City Hall, the State House, the Public Library, the Athenaeum, the Historical Society, the John Carter Brown and John Hay Libraries of Brown University, and the newly opened Shepley Library in Benefit Street. One may picture him yet as he was in those days; tall, slim, and blond, with studious eyes and a slight stoop, dressed somewhat carelessly, and giving a dominant impression of harmless awkwardness rather than attractiveness.      His walks were always adventures in antiquity, during which he managed to recapture from the myriad relics of a glamorous old city a vivid and connected picture of the centuries before. His home was a great Georgian mansion atop the well-nigh precipitous hill that rises just east of the river; and from the rear windows of its rambling wings he could look dizzily out over all the clustered spires, domes, roofs, and skyscraper summits of the lower town to the purple hills of the countryside beyond. Here he was born, and from the lovely classic porch of the double-bayed brick facade his nurse had first wheeled him in his carriage; past the little white farmhouse of two hundred years before that the town had long ago overtaken, and on toward the stately colleges along the shady, sumptuous street, whose old square brick mansions and smaller wooden houses with narrow, heavy-columned Doric porches dreamed solid and exclusive amidst their generous yards and gardens.      He had been wheeled, too, along sleepy Congdon Street, one tier lower down on the steep hill, and with all its eastern homes on high terraces. The small wooden houses averaged a greater age here, for it was up this hill that the growing town had climbed; and in these rides he had imbibed something of the colour of a quaint colonial village. The nurse used to stop and sit on the benches of Prospect Terrace to chat with policemen; and one of the childs first memories was of the great westward sea of hazy roofs and domes and steeples and far hills which he saw one winter afternoon from that great railed embankment, all violet and mystic against a fevered, apocalyptic sunset of reds and golds and purples and curious greens. The vast marble dome of the State House stood out in massive silhouette, its crowning statue haloed fantastically by a break in one of the tinted stratus clouds that barred the flaming sky.      When he was larger his famous walks began; first with his impatiently dragged nurse, and then alone in dreamy meditation. Farther and farther down that almost perpendicular hill he would venture, each time reaching older and quainter levels of the ancient city. He would hesitate gingerly down vertical Jenckes Street with its bank walls and colonial gables to the shady Benefit Street corner, where before him was a wooden antique with an Ionic-pilastered pair of doorways, and beside him a prehistoric gambrel-roofer with a bit of primal farmyard remaining, and the great Judge Durfee house with its fallen vestiges of Georgian grandeur. It was getting to be a slum here; but the titan elms cast a restoring shadow over the place, and the boy used to stroll south past the long lines of the pre-Revolutionary homes with their great central chimneys and classic portals. On the eastern side they were set high over basements with railed double flights of stone steps, and the young Charles could picture them as they were when the street was new, and red heels and periwigs set off the painted pediments whose signs of wear were now becoming so visible.      Westward the hill dropped almost as steeply as above, down to the old \"Town Street\" that the founders had laid out at the rivers edge in 1636. Here ran innumerable little lanes with leaning, huddled houses of immense antiquity; and fascinated though he was, it was long before he dared to thread their archaic verticality for fear they would turn out a dream or a gateway to unknown terrors. He found it much less formidable to continue along Benefit Street past the iron fence of St. Johns hidden churchyard and the rear of the 1761 Colony House and the mouldering bulk of the Golden Ball Inn where Washington stopped. At Meeting Street - the successive Gaol Lane and King Street of other periods - he would look upward to the east and see the arched flight of steps to which the highway had to resort in climbing the slope, and downward to the west, glimpsing the old brick colonial schoolhouse that smiles across the road at the ancient Sign of Shakespears Head where the Providence Gazette and Country-Journal was printed before the Revolution. Then came the exquisite First Baptist Church of 1775, luxurious with its matchless Gibbs steeple, and the Georgian roofs and cupolas hovering by. Here and to the southward the neighbourhood became better, flowering at last into a marvellous group of early mansions; but still the little ancient lanes led off down the precipice to the west, spectral in their many-gabled archaism and dipping to a riot of iridescent decay where the wicked old waterfront recalls its proud East India days amidst polyglot vice and squalor, rotting wharves, and blear-eyed ship-chandleries, with such surviving alley names as Packet, Bullion, Gold, Silver, Coin, Doubloon, Sovereign, Guilder, Dollar, Dime, and Cent.      Sometimes, as he grew taller and more adventurous, young Ward would venture down into this maelstrom of tottering houses, broken transoms, tumbling steps, twisted balustrades, swarthy faces, and nameless odours; winding from South Main to South Water, searching out the docks where the bay and sound steamers still touched, and returning northward at this lower level past the steep-roofed 1816 warehouses and the broad square at the Great Bridge, where the 1773 Market House still stands firm on its ancient arches. In that square he would pause to drink in the bewildering beauty of the old town as it rises on its eastward bluff, decked with its two Georgian spires and crowned by the vast new Christian Science dome as London is crowned by St. Pauls. He liked mostly to reach this point in the late afternoon, when the slanting sunlight touches the Market House and the ancient hill roofs and belfries with gold, and throws magic around the dreaming wharves where Providence Indiamen used to ride at anchor. After a long look he would grow almost dizzy with a poets love for the sight, and then he would scale the slope homeward in the dusk past the old white church and up the narrow precipitous ways where yellow gleams would begin to peep out in small-paned windows and through fanlights set high over double flights of steps with curious wrought-iron railings.      At other times, and in later years, he would seek for vivid contrasts; spending half a walk in the crumbling colonial regions northwest of his home, where the hill drops to the lower eminence of Stampers Hill with its ghetto and negro quarter clustering round the place where the Boston stage coach used to start before the Revolution, and the other half in the gracious southerly realm about George, Benevolent, Power, and Williams Streets, where the old slope holds unchanged the fine estates and bits of walled garden and steep green lane in which so many fragrant memories linger. These rambles, together with the diligent studies which accompanied them, certainly account for a large amount of the antiquarian lore which at last crowded the modern world from Charles Wards mind; and illustrate the mental soil upon which fell, in that fateful winter of 1919-20, the seeds that came to such strange and terrible fruition.      Dr. Willett is certain that, up to this ill-omened winter of first change, Charles Wards antiquarianism was free from every trace of the morbid. Graveyards held for him no particular attraction beyond their quaintness and historic value, and of anything like violence or savage instinct he was utterly devoid. Then, by insidious degrees, there appeared to develop a curious sequel to one of his genealogical triumphs of the year before; when he had discovered among his maternal ancestors a certain very long-lived man named Joseph Curwen, who had come from Salem in March of 1692, and about whom a whispered series of highly peculiar and disquieting stories clustered.      Wards great-great-grandfather Welcome Potter had in 1785 married a certain \"Ann Tillinghast, daughter of Mrs. Eliza, daughter to Capt. James Tillinghast\", of whose paternity the family had preserved no trace. Late in 1918, whilst examining a volume of original town records in manuscript, the young genealogist encountered an entry describing a legal change of name, by which in 1772 a Mrs. Eliza Curwen, widow of Joseph Curwen, resumed, along with her seven-year-old daughter Ann, her maiden name of Tillinghast; on the ground that her Husbands name was become a publick Reproach by Reason of what was knowne after his Decease; the which confirming an antient common Rumour, tho not to be credited by a loyall Wife till so proven as to be wholely past Doubting. This entry came to light upon the accidental separation of two leaves which had been carefully pasted together and treated as one by a laboured revision of the page numbers.      It was at once clear to Charles Ward that he had indeed discovered a hitherto unknown great-great-great-grandfather. The discovery doubly excited him because he had already heard vague reports and seen scattered allusions relating to this person; about whom there remained so few publicly available records, aside from those becoming public only in modern times, that it almost seemed as if a conspiracy had existed to blot him from memory. What did appear, moreover, was of such a singular and provocative nature that one could not fail to imagine curiously what it was that the colonial recorders were so anxious to conceal and forget; or to suspect that the deletion had reasons all too valid.      Before this, Ward had been content to let his romancing about old Joseph Curwen remain in the idle stage; but having discovered his own relationship to this apparently \"hushed-up\" character, he proceeded to hunt out as systematically as possible whatever he might find concerning him. In this excited quest he eventually succeeded beyond his highest expectations; for old letters, diaries, and sheaves of unpublished memoirs in cobwebbed Providence garrets and elsewhere yielded many illuminating passages which their writers had not thought it worth their while to destroy. One important sidelight came from a point as remote as New York, where some Rhode Island colonial correspondence was stored in the Museum at Fraunces Tavern. The really crucial thing, though, and what in Dr. Willetts opinion formed the definite source of Wards undoing, was the matter found in August 1919 behind the panelling of the crumbling house in Olney Court. It was that, beyond a doubt, which opened up those black vistas whose end was deeper than the pit.", "III.Meanwhile Old Whateley continued to buy cattle without measurably increasing the size of his herd. He also cut timber and began to repair the unused parts of his house—a spacious, peaked-roofed affair whose rear end was buried entirely in the rocky hillside, and whose three least-ruined ground-floor rooms had always been sufficient for himself and his daughter. There must have been prodigious reserves of strength in the old man to enable him to accomplish so much hard labour; and though he still babbled dementedly at times, his carpentry seemed to shew the effects of sound calculation. It had already begun as soon as Wilbur was born, when one of the many tool-sheds had been put suddenly in order, clapboarded, and fitted with a stout fresh lock. Now, in restoring the abandoned upper story of the house, he was a no less thorough craftsman. His mania shewed itself only in his tight boarding-up of all the windows in the reclaimed section—though many declared that it was a crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at all. Less inexplicable was his fitting up of another downstairs room for his new grandson—a room which several callers saw, though no one was ever admitted to the closely boarded upper story. This chamber he lined with tall, firm shelving; along which he began gradually to arrange, in apparently careful order, all the rotting ancient books and parts of books which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously in odd corners of the various rooms.      “I made some use of ’em,” he would say as he tried to mend a torn black-letter page with paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove, “but the boy’s fitten to make better use of ’em. He’d orter hev ’em as well sot as he kin, for they’re goin’ to be all of his larnin’.”      When Wilbur was a year and seven months old—in September of 1914—his size and accomplishments were almost alarming. He had grown as large as a child of four, and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker. He ran freely about the fields and hills, and accompanied his mother on all her wanderings. At home he would pore diligently over the queer pictures and charts in his grandfather’s books, while Old Whateley would instruct and catechise him through long, hushed afternoons. By this time the restoration of the house was finished, and those who watched it wondered why one of the upper windows had been made into a solid plank door. It was a window in the rear of the east gable end, close against the hill; and no one could imagine why a cleated wooden runway was built up to it from the ground. About the period of this work’s completion people noticed that the old tool-house, tightly locked and windowlessly clapboarded since Wilbur’s birth, had been abandoned again. The door swung listlessly open, and when Earl Sawyer once stepped within after a cattle-selling call on Old Whateley he was quite discomposed by the singular odour he encountered—such a stench, he averred, as he had never before smelt in all his life except near the Indian circles on the hills, and which could not come from anything sane or of this earth. But then, the homes and sheds of Dunwich folk have never been remarkable for olfactory immaculateness.      The following months were void of visible events, save that everyone swore to a slow but steady increase in the mysterious hill noises. On May-Eve of 1915 there were tremors which even the Aylesbury people felt, whilst the following Hallowe’en produced an underground rumbling queerly synchronised with bursts of flame—“them witch Whateleys’ doin’s”—from the summit of Sentinel Hill. Wilbur was growing up uncannily, so that he looked like a boy of ten as he entered his fourth year. He read avidly by himself now; but talked much less than formerly. A settled taciturnity was absorbing him, and for the first time people began to speak specifically of the dawning look of evil in his goatish face. He would sometimes mutter an unfamiliar jargon, and chant in bizarre rhythms which chilled the listener with a sense of unexplainable terror. The aversion displayed toward him by dogs had now become a matter of wide remark, and he was obliged to carry a pistol in order to traverse the countryside in safety. His occasional use of the weapon did not enhance his popularity amongst the owners of canine guardians.      The few callers at the house would often find Lavinia alone on the ground floor, while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the boarded-up second story. She would never tell what her father and the boy were doing up there, though once she turned pale and displayed an abnormal degree of fear when a jocose fish-peddler tried the locked door leading to the stairway. That peddler told the store loungers at Dunwich Village that he thought he heard a horse stamping on that floor above. The loungers reflected, thinking of the door and runway, and of the cattle that so swiftly disappeared. Then they shuddered as they recalled tales of Old Whateley’s youth, and of the strange things that are called out of the earth when a bullock is sacrificed at the proper time to certain heathen gods. It had for some time been noticed that dogs had begun to hate and fear the whole Whateley place as violently as they hated and feared young Wilbur personally.      In 1917 the war came, and Squire Sawyer Whateley, as chairman of the local draft board, had hard work finding a quota of young Dunwich men fit even to be sent to a development camp. The government, alarmed at such signs of wholesale regional decadence, sent several officers and medical experts to investigate; conducting a survey which New England newspaper readers may still recall. It was the publicity attending this investigation which set reporters on the track of the Whateleys, and caused the Boston Globe and Arkham Advertiser to print flamboyant Sunday stories of young Wilbur’s precociousness, Old Whateley’s black magic, the shelves of strange books, the sealed second story of the ancient farmhouse, and the weirdness of the whole region and its hill noises. Wilbur was four and a half then, and looked like a lad of fifteen. His lips and cheeks were fuzzy with a coarse dark down, and his voice had begun to break.      Earl Sawyer went out to the Whateley place with both sets of reporters and camera men, and called their attention to the queer stench which now seemed to trickle down from the sealed upper spaces. It was, he said, exactly like a smell he had found in the tool-shed abandoned when the house was finally repaired; and like the faint odours which he sometimes thought he caught near the stone circles on the mountains. Dunwich folk read the stories when they appeared, and grinned over the obvious mistakes. They wondered, too, why the writers made so much of the fact that Old Whateley always paid for his cattle in gold pieces of extremely ancient date. The Whateleys had received their visitors with ill-concealed distaste, though they did not dare court further publicity by a violent resistance or refusal to talk."]}
{"id": "EN005", "pair": ["An autumnal chill descended upon the streets of Glaston as the young man walked upon the concrete sidewalk, passing redbrick storefronts and shop windows, every surface still wet with the morning rain. Leaves, red and orange and each vibrant in their hue, were shaken loose from the trees lining the street by the wind, landing wherever they fell. For an instant in time, the spectacle of the leaves drew the attention of the man, in fact little more than a teenage boy, as he made his way toward the corner. However, Joseph Clayton, clad in bluejeans and jacket with a backpack slung from his shoulders, had far more important things to focus on than a show of falling leaves. An important test for this semester was arriving in a week or so and he needed to study.Also, he was getting quite hungry this close to lunch.As Joseph rounded the corner and continued toward his favorite eatery, he wondered if he would get swamped in the usual lunch crowd. However, as he saw the front of the Leng Trinh Restaurant, his thoughts turned to quiet dejection.\"Damnit!\" muttered Joseph as he approached the eatery. The reason for this turn in mood was the carpet of tempered glass fragments on the sidewalk below the picture window at the front of the establishment, which was now covered by plastic sheeting. Thuch Van Trinh, one half of the husband-and-wife ownership, was wearing a plaid jacket over his apron and usual cooking clothes and was shoveling the broken glass into a bucket. \"Hey, Mr. Trinh, hows it going?\". Joseph asked with a smile. This was more false cheer than anything, as Joseph could guess how Thuch must be feeling: anger was always a popular choice, followed closely by worry about the reason why.Despite what he must have been feeling, Thuch Van Trinh grinned back, the black lines of his facial tattooing creasing as the muscles moved under his cheeks. \"Not so good, Mr. Clayton. If this keeps up, I may have to put in Plexiglas so that the window wont break.\" The Trinhs accents, as his parents and the other adults of the town told it, had been rather strong (even unusually so) when they had immigrated to Glaston from their first home in Boston. This had usually been waved off by their purported origins in the remote hills on the Vietnam-Laos border, seemingly collaborated by how their teeth had been dyed black. On the other hand, given their rural roots, their speed in adapting local speech patterns so that they now sounded more like second generation Americans (and especially their daughters complete lack of any accent except the local standard) did make for a puzzling situation. However, for their ease of assimilation and the food they served, they had become well-liked in the community.So why were things like this happening to them recently? \"How many times does this make this month; two, three?\" Joseph had to ask this, wondering if things were worse than he thought.\"Its happened three times already, this time not more than an hour ago. Thanh wants to install security cameras to watch the place and with how small and cheap they are now, I think we just might.\" An hour ago? Theyd smashed a picture window in broad daylight? Who in town could be that stupid or that angry? Josephs train of thought was broken then, when Thuch said something of much more interest to the younger man. \"By the way, if youre looking for Marie, shes helping her mother in the kitchen. Even without a window we seem to be doing good business.\" Thuch went back to his work and Joseph, not wanting to delay any longer, entered the restaurant.Just as Thuch had said, Leng Trinh still had its usual busy lunchtime crowd, albeit one that was concentrated near the back wall. Picking his way around tables packed with diners, Joseph finally arrived at a table set for two, a reserved sign upon it. Removing his backpack and laying it beside a chair, he sat down, shuffled off his coat and went to bury his nose in the menu.It always felt a bit odd to Joseph, eating in an ethnic restaurant where none of the diners were the same ethnicity as the cooks, or even from the same part of the world. However, none of it mattered when the food was as good as it was here.\"Now then, what would a fine, upstanding New England boy like yourself want in a place like this?\" The voice that asked this was soft, amused, female and had an almost mocking tone. It also had the accent of the New England uplands. To Joseph, it could only be one person.\"The same thing I always get here.\" He answered dryly before looking up from the menu. There, holding a pad of paper and a pen, was teenage girl with almond-shaped eyes, shoulder length black hair with green streaks, a cooking apron and an amused grin. \"Hi Marie... you sure your moms alright with you waitressing this crowd?\"\"Weve got enough help in the kitchen already and Dads coming in after all the glass is cleaned up.\" She glanced up at the window, plastic sheet and all, after she wrote his order down. \"I just wish we knew who was doing this. If we dont get someone else to cough up some money, our insurance company might go sour on us.\" Marie went back to the kitchen to get the food for both of them.Ten minutes later, she was laying out two place settings of food that had been prepared ahead of time. \"Alright, thats two plates of grilled pork on beds of Leng-style rice, your dish of steamed green beans with soy sauce for dipping, my bowl of soup and two cans of soda.\" Theyd eat lunch before studying, with Joseph paying the tab for both of them.If anyone asked, it wasnt a date. Not in the strictest sense, anyway.\"What, no bak bon dzhow?\" Asked Joseph, decidedly disappointed at the apparent lack of the special ingredient.To this, Marie moved a small earthen bowl from the serving tray onto the table and lifted the lid to reveal a thick gray sauce containing mushrooms and cracked black pepper. \"Would I be one to deny you the gravy of the gods?\" She asked (rhetorically) with a soft smile; Joseph couldnt help but smile back as he cracked the tab on his soda and began on his green beans.A bit later, when his beans were gone and Marie had almost finished her soup, Joesph began formulating a question that related to a curious thought that had sprung up earlier. \"Not to sound like a nag or anything, but Im just curious but what was all that upstanding stuff about?\" The only time he had ever heard anyone talk like that was...Oh God...Marie swallowed the last bits of her soup. \"Oh, I dont know. Maybe Its that I had no idea that the son of insurance brokers had such deep and aristocratic roots? Maybe its that I was surprised to find out that the Claytons had come not from hardy New England farming stock as I had assumed, but from the urbane, wealthy ranks of those grand Brahmins of Boston? Im sure Granny Cora could tell some fascinating stories about the old days; she sure seemed interested in mine.\" If anything, Marie took the entire thing in stride, treating both the memory of the experience and the experience itself with a a great deal of interested amusement. Certainly, mocking the type of language she had encountered was almost cracking her up.Joseph, on the other hand, had first felt bemusement at the scene in which the Clayton family reunion of the past summer had found itself, quickly turning into outright embarrassment. \"Look, Im sorry that I didnt tell you about her, but everybody thought that she wouldnt be able to come due to health concerns. Its not my fault that a half-senile, 97 year old woman worked up enough stubbornness to drag her nurse halfway across the state!\".\"I never said anything about anyone being at fault. I just thought it was an interesting revelation about your family.\" She had meant her cajoling in good humour, but Josephs defensiveness and embarrassment were never good emotions to bring out. \"Anyway, most people would be proud to have the Boston gentry in their family history: industrialists, merchants, art, culture, philanthropy, charity...\" With every word, Marie spooned a bit of ban boc dzhow onto her grilled pork.\"As well as whaling, slave trading, opium smuggling, snobbery and having your entire life guided by the expectations of your peers; exactly the sorts of things my parents taught me to loathe. The thing is, my great-great-grandmother came from a very select, very privileged and lily-white background; I was worried that shed... well, react oddly to you.\" Joseph retorted as he began spooning (or rather, pouring) the sauce onto his meat after Marie had finished with it and passed it to him. In the case of Cora Clayton (nee Coffin), Josephs fear hadnt primarily been that she would find Marie objectionable on account of her race since that prejudice had been more ingrained in her parents generation than hers. His fear had instead been that his great great grandmother, as self-proclaimed guardian of the old, aristocratic traditions, might object to their relationship because the Trinhs were restaurateurs with no history of pedigree, education or money behind them.In Coras world (the 1920s, where her mind was half the time), heirs had married heiresses, families had coordinated their fortunes and everyone had kept an eye on everyone else; these were rules of decorum that had lasted for her long after the Claytons had gone bust in the great Crash of 29. The fact that she had taken Joseph aside and explained her concerns to him had done nothing to soothe his embarrassment, although he had finally convinced her that, being naturalized citizens with a successful restaurant, the Trinhs were firmly in the middling classes. She had also estimated that said restaurant, with no other inheritors besides Marie, would most likely pass into Clayton hands in the fullness of time.No one had dared explain to her the differences between modern teenage dating and the genteel courtships of her youth.\"I dont think she reacted that oddly. Sure, she was so out of date that you had to explain that I meant French Indochina when I said that my parents came from Vietnam and she did seem a bit too fascinated with my families origins and, alright, it was weird hearing someone actually use the word courting without trying to be funny. However, it was kind of nice to speak French with someone in this town after all the time my parents invested in me learning it.\" Marie knew that while it had been terrifying for Joseph, having to put up with his relatives dissection of his relationship and fearing disapproval, she herself had enjoyed a chance to see if the old stereotypes were true. When it had become clear to Marie that the elderly woman was not about to spew racial epitaphs at her but was, indeed, fascinated as to her families background, Marie had made it a point to ham it up in telling their story.To an entranced Cora Clayton, Marie had described her parents lives before emigration as a subsistence existence in a village high up in the fog-choked mountain passes. She had woven scenes of her people worshiping strange, heathen gods far from the civilized lands of the Buddha and partaking in ghastly rituals to ensure harvests of rice from narrow mountainside terraces. She told the old woman that her parents had tired of such a life and had dreamed of something more, something in the wider world glimpsed in third-hand magazines and radio broadcasts.After receiving a dispensation from their village shaman to leave (but promising to sent back remittances), they had made their way to Hanoi and then to Boston and finally to Glaston where, having never truly given up the more religious and symbolic aspects of their heathenish past, they nevertheless had made good names for themselves in the community. Marie had made sure that her prose had been both lurid and exotic so as to fully entrance a child of the Age of Empire as well as making proper use of tone, whether enraptured, casual or deathly serious, to emphasize mood. The end result was to make it sound as if her culture wasnt just some rural outlet of modern Vietnam or Laos, but as if it was truly unlike any other in the world.That was an opinion that Joseph was also rapidly adopting.They ate in relative silence for a while, the bustle of the lunch crowd beginning to die down as people left, many of them stopping to talk to Mr. Trinh at the till, expressing their concern over what had happened with the window. They were just about half done when Joseph began another conversation. \"So, did you know that theres a Heritage Day coming up at school in a few weeks?\"\"Yeah, and?\" Deep down in her gut, Marie was beginning to get a slightly worried feeling from the direction this conversation was going. This pretty much happened whenever the subject of her parents past came up but, like so many times before, she could probably bluff her way through it.\"I thought that, maybe, we could do something for it. I was thinking about dredging up something from Normandy because I didnt want to clog up the schedule with another variation of British regional culture.\" It sounded perfectly innocent, but Marie knew that this was a potentially tricky situation that might require misdirection, a convincing excuse and possible outright lying.She hated lying to Joseph.\"Alright then. You can do that, Ill do the Vietnamese thing and well knock em all dead.\" She answered with an enthusiasm that she hoped had betrayed nothing of her growing unease with the conversation. This seemed to provoke nothing but a non-committal murmur of agreement and thus, thinking that that was over with, she began eating again.However, that was not the end of it.\"By Vietnamese, do you mean the standard culture from around Hanoi... or the culture from your parents home village?\" Joseph asked, seemingly as if only for the purpose of clarification. There was much more behind it though, and whether it was just ingrained paranoia or any real danger of exposure, Marie knew that this was entering onto some very tenuous and potentially very dangerous ground. Still, the subject had to be breached.\"Arent they pretty much the same? I mean, sure, it was pretty rural back there, but whether village or city, we were all Viet: same language, same culture, same blood, same... pretty much everything, when you think about it.\" As denials went, this one wasnt half bad: sincere enough to be taken seriously and with enough internal logic that it wouldnt fall apart immediately in the face of the mildly educated mind.On this subject, however, Joseph had become rather more than merely mildly educated. He had observed things for a long time: a lot of little things and one or two big things for the most part. And he, after long deliberation and study, had discovered that some of those things just didnt match up.\"You know, there was a time when I could believe that. But... there are just too many deviations to discount.\" Joesph stopped eating all together, putting down his fork and looking his girlfriend straight in the eyes before closing and opening them again, as if to rally his thoughts. \"The food, for one thing, isnt like any kind of Vietnamese food Ive read about. Yes, you have the side dishes but thats about it for similarity. Second, your parents tattoos. Again, unlike any other group in Southeast Asia; the closest matches I could find were incised lines on bronze figurines from over two thousand years ago.\"He stopped again. \"And then theres the language you guys speak. Im fairly sure its in the Mon-Khmer group, but Ive been doing some research and... honestly, Ive seen words on this menu that Ive never been able to find in any other source. And Im not the only one whos noticed these things.\" Joesph saw panic flash across Maries eyes, though she tried to hide it. \"Most people dont pay attention and honestly dont care, and the ones who do notice just assume that you guys are either Hmong or some little minority that no-ones ever heard of... but even that doesnt match very well either. Its like you said, youre Viet... but what about all this other stuff?\"It was then that Marie could have ended it all: the doubts, the questions, the lingering curiosity... as well as twenty one centuries of secrecy, tradition and very likely her relationship with this young man. In the end, she decided to dodge again. \"What can I say? We were very rural.\" When Joesph just got this frustrated look on his face, Marie sighed, reached across the table and enveloped one of his hands with hers. \"Look, Ill try and dredge something up if I can, but I cant promise anything, okay?\"Joseph mulled on this lack of answers, but as the moment dragged on, his resistance wore down. \"Alright. If you dont want to talk about your culture, thats alright; lots of people come to America to get away from stuff. But I still am sorta curious.\" Then he changed the subject. \"Anyway, after we eat, we should begin studying for our tests. Do you want to go over the English or the Algebra first?\"\"We should do the Math first, then we can cool off with the Shakespeare. But we better not let the food get cold, what with how the sauce gets if allowed to sit for too long.\" Marie began eating again and, after a few beats, Joseph resumed as well.They stayed at that table for many hours, going over and revising their knowledge of maths and literature. However, already Marie wondered if there was something she could reveal, something that she could show about her parents culture that would not threaten expose them and, as the old saying went among her tribe, get them cut in half and buried in two graves.Later that night, The Trinhs upstairs apartmentTo Maries relief, her parents reaction to her plan wasnt anger. On the other hand, fear and worry could be almost as painful.\"I know how you feel about the Clayton boy. Hes well-liked, intelligent and his parents are our insurance agents.\" Thanh Thi Trinh began, speaking in her families particular dialect of Viet as she, Marie and Thuch Van sat around their dining room table. \"But I ask this of you: is Joesph and his interest in this celebration worth the risk of exposure and, may I add, possible death when this town realizes who we are, when they realize what we are?\" Thanh Thi had always been the more reserved, more cautious and, frankly, more paranoid spouse in this family when it came to their safety. Where her husband was the face of the restaurant, she ran the kitchen with an eye on the back door and all of their cooks. While Thuch made friendly at social gatherings, Thanh kept track of all possible escape routes and who was and wasnt looking at them. She kept track of any news about gangs and hate-group activity in the area, and about any other strange things.The sort of things that might lure out the kind of people who hunted their people.But Marie had prepared for this. \"Mother, I know the risks that revealing the secrets of our people would bring. However, I am counting on two circumstances to make sure that only the most benign and harmless information is portrayed.\" She rallied herself, knowing that the way she handled this could make the difference on how she presented herself to nearly everyone, especially Joseph . \"First, I must inform both of you that there are some people in this town, including my boyfriend, that realize that we are not quite from the mainstream culture of modern Vietnam.\" At this, both Thanh and Thuch got even more worried but they werent shocked, seeing as any bumpkin with an Internet connection could find that tribal tattooing wasnt really the rage in downtown Hanoi. \"The good news is that while these people realize that we belong to a distinct subgroup, they often deduce that we are either rural Hmong or some other obscure ethnic group. In other words, they know nothing about who our people are and, like the rest of the town, they honestly do not care.\"\"What about the nature of our traditons, Marie? What would you do, what rite of our people would be performed on that stage that would not end up with half the town vomiting and the other half trying to hang us?\" Her father had been relatively quiet in this conversation, but he knew that the rituals of his village had, during various times in history, left such a bad impression upon outsiders that they had responded in force to try to stamp them out.Here, Marie began grasping the thick, heavy and old scrapbook that lay closed upon the table before her. It had been entrusted to them by their village and, by the blessings of the Gods and their Instrument, they had kept it safe and hidden for more than twenty years. \"Father, it is not as if I wish to set up an alter on the stage, recite the incantations of the harvest rites and slice something open; frankly, I would have no idea how. However, I believe that there is a ritual that is benign, unusual and, even according to the author of this book, beautiful enough to make people forget its oddity.\" She opened the book, filled with sepia photographs and notes written in French on yellowed paper, to the page she had bookmarked. \"I want to do the Stork Dance.\"Her parents were quiet for a minute. Admittedly, this was probably the least unusual rite of their people and it did seem to have a calming effect on its audiences. However, it took weeks of intensive training in order to do it right, the costuming and specific actions depended on whether the dancer was a man or woman and the phonograph with the instrumental music and vocals, only having been recorded once before, was on the other side of the planet. It was a tall order to pull off for anyone. \"You do realize that practicing for the dance requires grueling routine, so much so that it might effect your school work?\" Asked her mother, wondering if her daughter was truly sincere.\"I know that. Ill just have to sacrifice my time with Joesph, a sacrifice that Im sure hed understand.\" Marie responded in English this time, the plans for her act becoming clearer. \"However, Ill need some help in creating the proper costuming and... I know that shipping items from the Old Country is like trying to smuggle Plutonium but if you could convince the shamans to release that phonograph for a month or two, I would be eternally grateful to all of them, and to you.\"Her parents wondered, not for the first time, if Marie truly comprehended what could be asked of that gratitude in the years to come. She had the opportunity to live a life completely detached from the paranoia, the fear and the constant danger that followed her people. Would she give that chance away simply for the sake of a boy?Whatever choice she made, however, was hers to make.In the end, they acquiesced... but not without informing their daughter of what their home village could ask of her in exchange for the items she wished. It might be years until it was asked but one day, a representative of their village would approach her and request a repayment, be it in money, information or something else.It was that \"something else\" that truly worried Thuch and Thanh.", "May 19th, 1929,Miskatonic University, Arkham, Mass.In all honesty, the manner which Robert Olmstead exited the Chancellors office was not the most graceful to be seen in the history of Miskatonic University. However, perhaps \"exited\" is too neutral a term for a man being forcibly escorted out the double doors by two University proctors with a firm grasp on his forearms. \"Ejected\" is probably a good description though \"assaulted\" would have a good chance of being upheld by a court. As Mr. Olmstead was finally shoved out into the hall, he finally lost his balance and fell to his knees, the voluminous robes which he had worn since his arrival seeming to weigh him down.As Hiriam Willows and Brian Fife rushed out of the office and hastened to Roberts side, the man himself seemed... tired, drained of energy and showing signs of a fatigue that had been present since the meeting had began. Still, Mr. Olmstead managed to raise his head to address Chancellor Douglas Gooding, who was still in his office. \"I take it... negotiations have ended.\" Robert said this in as controlled a way as possible, trying to ignore the irritation at the back of his throat and the sides of his neck.\"Negotiations, as you call them, never began.\" Chancellor Gooding, a patrician of a man at the age of 57, had risen from behind his desk and was now walking toward the spot where Mr. Olmstead has stood and presented his case. \"This College has been handed a chance to claim credit for discovering the root devices behind most, if not all, of vertebrate biology and promises to make careers for many of our staff and students. Unless the Navy, who has graciously allowed access to its prisoners for this purpose, decides to either withdraw that access or, as you suggest, release them back into the general population, I see no reason why they should not remain under our supervision in their current quarters.\" Gooding eyes fell upon the floor where Robert had stood... and the staff that now lay on the floor. It was a strange thing: the matter itself almost resembled gray, petrified wood but in places its form showed characteristics of crustacean carapace or of the strange shapes present in fishbone or shark-jaw and, when the light hit it just so, the surface displayed a luster more akin to Nautilus shell or Mother of Pearl than any of those things.Gooding, in a sudden fit of antiquarian fascination, began kneeling down to take the strange rod. \"However, if you could tell us about this staff...\" Just as his the tips of his fingers brushed against the smooth surface the staff, seemingly under its own power, jerked butt-first towards the door, skidding over the floors polished hardwood planks. When it reached Robert. who was now being helped to his feet by Professor Fife, the staff actually began tipping up on its butt, the shaft guiding itself into Roberts limp, open hand.Grasping the staff to regain his posture, Robert glanced once more at Gooding. \"The staff is a secret that keeps itself. As to my plea... if that is your decision, I pray that you do not live to reap the whirlwind.\"\"Is that a threat?\" Chancellor Gooding was losing patience rapidly after this manifestation of the strange had made an intrusion into his office and annoyance was threatening to turn to anger.\"Merely a warning, good Chancellor.\" These were the last words that Robert Olmstead spoke to Gooding as Fife, carrying the papers that Olmstead had presented, helped him as he unsteadily walked down the hallway, supported by his implement.Just as Hiriam Willows was about to follow the pair, Gooding called to him. \"Hiriam! Get back in this office!\" Willows, his eyes continuing to follow his two companions down the hall for a moment, turned and walked back into the Chancellors office with a tightening of the lips and the speed of a slow stroll, more amenable to his aging legs than the fast walk he had so recently exerted himself with. \"Im surprised, Douglas.\"\"Surprised that I called you back in here?\" Asked Gooding as he sat back down behind his desk.\"That we are apparently operating on a first name basis now. As I recall, that has not been our habit since nineteen hundred and... seven, was it?\" It may have been facetious (to say the least) in bringing this up but after today, last winter and, to be honest, most days since Gooding had restricted Willows to a single morning class per week, he and the Chancellor has not quite been on the best of terms.\"Ah yes, the Cuba business. However... actually, that ispart of why I called you in here.\" Gooding pointed an almost accusatory finger at the older man. \"As I recall, youwere the one to countermand my decision to use force against those two Voodoo cults in Las Tunas.\"\"First of all, they were Santeria practitioners. Second, I was able to forge an armistice between the two warring factions and convince them to give up their murderous ways...\"\"In favor of continued use of animal sacrifice, I remember, I remember.\" Gooding put that accusatory finger to his temple as if to calm a throbbing. Then that finger returned to the standing faculty member. \"But whether youre French or Spanish does not mean much of anything when youre trying to rip open a portal to the tenth dimension, summoning dangerous ichors and vapors from beyond and, may I remind you, trying to violently murderas many people as needed for their insane goals. Hiriam... I know that youre a Quaker, I knowthat negotiating between groups of violent, degenerate heathens has always been your strong point, but this is something radicallydifferent.\"The Chancellor noticed Willows disbelieving roll of the eyes but continued. \"These... things have been present in and off the coast of Essex Country for the better part of a century. Theyve killed people, they subverted local government, through their negligence the port of Innsmouth nearly crumbled due to neglect... not to mention that theyve potentially forced themselves on local residents due to the existence of apparently hybrid individuals!\" He motioned out the door and pointed in the direction that Olmstead and Fife had exited. \"Did you happen to take a good look at the person who was just ejected from this office? My God Hiriam, the man was practically turning into a herring before our very eyes!\" Gooding seemed to calm down a bit. \"I know you were always one to try to see both sides of the argument, to resolve conflicts through calm deliberation... but this wasntnegotiation. This was a demand backed by veiled threats. I remember you being much sterner in the face of demands than this.\" There was a thoughtful pause. \"What happened in Virginia, Hiriam? Ever since you got back, youve been at your usual quest for cooperation between man and eldritch forces except... moreso.\"A hundred images flashed in Willows mind of that December in the Luray Valley. The little clusters of field-stone houses and barns around the southern tip of Mt. Ida; the lean-faced Quaker farm-folk; the walk through the community cemetery and the graves of his mothers family, the Caulfields. The children, so desperate to experience a properly Victorian Christmas in pageantry unknown by the community, inviting him to a snowball fight and following his lead in decorating and games (which he had found invigorating at the time). The experience of being around others of his faith for the first time in decades.But there was also the first time he had ever been forced to kill, as a .45 caliber ACP round hit dead center on his war-painted assailant in the mountain forests. The moment when he had discovered the small shrine beneath the Longhouse Meeting Hall with its black deer hides, Eastern Elk antlers and strange mix of artifacts. The sight of his hosts sacrificing pigs, wailing and dancing in the manner of the Seneca Iroquois at an isolated stone circle south along the mountains from the Armys battle with their foes, mourning for all the dead who would be brought out. And two of the bodies brought back, an apparent pair of adult twin sisters in matching warpaint who had charged the federal troops with knives before being mowed down: their hands had been intertwined even as fire from Thompson submachineguns had demolished their ribcages, the agony of their situation apparent from their found journals... the swelling around their eyes under the paint indicative of weeping.Hiriam shrugged as if he experienced nothing. \"Just a bit of reconnection with my mothers side of the family. Now, if you will excuse me?\" Before Gooding could even respond, Hiriam Willows walked out of the office and closed the doors behind him, exhaling in relief before he continued on to Professor Fifes office.Shortly, Professor Fifes OfficeBrian Fife sighed in frustration and concern as he dabbed the side of Robert Olmsteads neck with a handkerchief soaked in ice water. \"When was the last time you bothered to moisten the reservoir layers in this cloak? Any longer without adequate water around the gills and you would have been coughing up blood.\"Robert, sitting in a chair across from Fife, was now much less weary now that relief was being applied. \" There was no time. I had to act quickly to try to get them released and the last two days have been a flurry.\"\"Well, its just as well that I keep ice and water in my study or you would have...\" Fife was interrupted by Hiriam Willows entry into the office who, upon entering, simply asked himself how a militant like Douglas Gooding had become chancellor. Fifes answer to this question was concise. \"Well, Masterson died of Diphtheria while in Shanghai, Harvey has his Cocaine habit, Peaslee isnt totally trusted after that Yith business and yourefused to take any oath of office acceptable to the Congregationalist clergy. Gooding was the only member of the senior faculty with the necessary respectability left.\" \"Thank you very much. Now, what do we do next?\" Hiriam sat down in another chair, forming a semicircular huddle as he addressed Olmstead. \"Gooding isnt going to budge an inch without a proper prodding, the Arkham Police are beginning to take note of your lodgings at the Miskatonic Hotel and your current appearance which, may I remark, is becoming more piscine by the day, will not inspire confidence in the other involved parties.\"\"Then we have to properly prod. I have to prod. I owe that much at least.\" Robert, now that his neck and gills were properly wetted (and the kelp layers under his robe properly inundated with cold water), became quiet, both hands still across his lap, grasping the staff he had carried since he had arrived.Fife knew what he was thinking, for it was also close to his heart. \"Robert, you dont have to do this. The Priests of Yha-Nthlei wont judge you harshly if you dont bring home any more of our people than your cousin; I know its tragic, but its happened before that people have been lost to the surface world.\"Robert suddenly got a hard look in his eyes and stared directly at the other man. \"Do you know what it feels like to lose your parents, your child, your neighbors or friends? To not know where they were taken? To fear for their lives while they might be undergoing hideous, nefarious tortures? And then, one day, you are suddenly confronted with the grinning idiot who, in his disgust and primordial fear, ensured your loved ones capture and now, while you are forced to hide like a crab in the sand, are expected to welcome this fool into your ranks?\"He groaned at the memory... or even more than the memory. \"The punishment for my loutish treachery was harsh, but even a flayed back will not absolve all I have done, all I have seen. My flogging will not return parents to children or husbands to wives. My pain will not sooth the fear of mothers for their sons. And the welts upon my back will not make me forget the accusation, the pain... the sorrowin their eyes. I am doing this as much for myself as for them; doing it so that I wont have to live with my failures for an eternity.\" Willows and Fife were quiet until Fife quietly asked \"So, what now?\"\"If I cant do anything, the warriors will be swimming upstream in less than a week. When they get here... I cant promise that anyone will be safe.\" Robert looked pensive, a calculating look on his face. \"We... Iwill have to make an impression in front of Gooding. Somewhere public, somewhere will it will make an impression that cant be dismissed or ignored. Anything come to mind?\"It was then that it struck Hiriam. \"Of course, the regatta tomorrow! Gooding will be attendance, he hasto be in attendance according to College statutes. But what are you going to do?\"Having been asked, Robert began to think. \"I assume itll be on the Miskatonic?\"\"Where else? Hangmans Brook has never been deep enough for rowing and the University never affluent enough to construct a canal.\" Fife explained.\"Will there be many other people there?\" Robert asked again, something beginning to form in his already-changed brain.\"Everyone who can: students, alumni, dock workers, beggars... why do you ask?\" Hiriam was now curious as to this whole thing.Robert looked down at the staff in his hands, feeling the smooth surface but also feeling the power coursing through the object. The Staff of Dagon... said to have been wielded by their king and blessed by the mighty Priest to whom Dagon and Hydra had sworn loyalty. Once, it had been said to have performed wonders.Once... and perhaps again."]}
{"id": "EN074", "pair": ["IV. A Mutation and a Madness1.In the week following that memorable Good Friday Charles Ward was seen more often than usual, and was continually carrying books between his library and the attic laboratory. His actions were quiet and rational, but he had a furtive, hunted look which his mother did not like, and developed an incredibly ravenous appetite as gauged by his demands upon the cook. Dr. Willett had been told of those Friday noises and happenings, and on the following Tuesday had a long conversation with the youth in the library where the picture stared no more. The interview was, as always, inconclusive; but Willett is still ready to swear that the youth was sane and himself at the time. He held out promises of an early revelation, and spoke of the need of securing a laboratory elsewhere. At the loss of the portrait he grieved singularly little considering his first enthusiasm over it, but seemed to find something of positive humour in its sudden crumbling.      About the second week Charles began to be absent from the house for long periods, and one day when good old black Hannah came to help with the spring cleaning she mentioned his frequent visits to the old house in Olney Court, where he would come with a large valise and perform curious delvings in the cellar. He was always very liberal to her and to old Asa, but seemed more worried than he used to be; which grieved her very much, since she had watched him grow up from birth. Another report of his doings came from Pawtuxet, where some friends of the family saw him at a distance a surprising number of times. He seemed to haunt the resort and canoe-house of Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet, and subsequent inquiries by Dr. Willett at that place brought out the fact that his purpose was always to secure access to the rather hedged-in river-bank, along which he would walk toward the north, usually not reappearing for a very long while.      Late in May came a momentary revival of ritualistic sounds in the attic laboratory which brought a stern reproof from Mr. Ward and a somewhat distracted promise of amendment from Charles. It occurred one morning, and seemed to form a resumption of the imaginary conversation noted on that turbulent Good Friday. The youth was arguing or remonstrating hotly with himself, for there suddenly burst forth a perfectly distinguishable series of clashing shouts in differentiated tones like alternate demands and denials which caused Mrs. Ward to run upstairs and listen at the door. She could hear no more than a fragment whose only plain words were \"must have it red for three months\", and upon her knocking all sounds ceased at once. When Charles was later questioned by his father he said that there were certain conflicts of spheres of consciousness which only great skill could avoid, but which he would try to transfer to other realms.      About the middle of June a queer nocturnal incident occurred. In the early evening there had been some noise and thumping in the laboratory upstairs, and Mr. Ward was on the point of investigating when it suddenly quieted down. That midnight, after the family had retired, the butler was nightlocking the front door when according to his statement Charles appeared somewhat blunderingly and uncertainly at the foot of the stairs with a large suitcase and made signs that he wished egress. The youth spoke no word, but the worthy Yorkshireman caught one sight of his fevered eyes and trembled causelessly. He opened the door and young Ward went out, but in the morning he presented his resignation to Mrs. Ward. There was, he said, something unholy in the glance Charles had fixed on him. It was no way for a young gentleman to look at an honest person, and he could not possibly stay another night. Mrs. Ward allowed the man to depart, but she did not value his statement highly. To fancy Charles in a savage state that night was quite ridiculous, for as long as she had remained awake she had heard faint sounds from the laboratory above; sounds as if of sobbing and pacing, and of a sighing which told only of despairs profoundest depths. Mrs. Ward had grown used to listening for sounds in the night, for the mystery of her son was fast driving all else from her mind.      The next evening, much as on another evening nearly three months before, Charles Ward seized the newspaper very early and accidentally lost the main section. The matter was not recalled till later, when Dr. Willett began checking up loose ends and searching out missing links here and there. In the Journal office he found the section which Charles had lost, and marked two items as of possible significance. They were as follows:More Cemetery DelvingIt was this morning discovered by Robert Hart, night watchman at the North Burial Ground, that ghouls were again at work in the ancient portion of the cemetery. The grave of Ezra Weeden, who was born in 1740 and died in 1824, according to his uprooted and savagely splintered slate headstone, was found excavated and rifled, the work being evidently done with a spade stolen from an adjacent tool-shed.      Whatever the contents may have been after more than a century of burial, all was gone except a few slivers of decayed wood. There were no wheel tracks, but the police have measured a single set of footprints which they found in the vicinity, and which indicate the boots of a man of refinement.      Hart is inclined to link this incident with the digging discovered last March, when a party in a motor truck were frightened away after making a deep excavation; but Sergt. Riley of the Second Station discounts this theory and points to vital differences in the two cases. In March the digging had been in a spot where no grave was known; but this time a well-marked and cared-for grave had been rifled with every evidence of deliberate purpose, and with a conscious malignity expressed in the splintering of the slab which had been intact up to the day before.      Members of the Weeden family, notified of the happening, expressed their astonishment and regret; and were wholly unable to think of any enemy who would care to violate the grave of their ancestor. Hazard Weeden of 598 Angell Street recalls a family legend according to which Ezra Weeden was involved in some very peculiar circumstances, not dishonourable to himself, shortly before the Revolution; but of any modern feud or mystery he is frankly ignorant. Inspector Cunningham has been assigned to the case, and hopes to uncover some valuable clues in the near future.Dogs Noisy in Pawtuxet      Residents of Pawtuxet were aroused about 3 a.m. today by a phenomenal baying of dogs which seemed to centre near the river just north of Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet. The volume and quality of the howling were unusually odd, according to most who heard it; and Fred Lemdin, night watchman at Rhodes, declares it was mixed with something very like the shrieks of a man in mortal terror and agony. A sharp and very brief thunderstorm, which seemed to strike somewhere near the bank of the river, put an end to the disturbance. Strange and unpleasant odours, probably from the oil tanks along the bay, are popularly linked with this incident; and may have had their share in exciting the dogs.      The aspect of Charles now became very haggard and hunted, and all agreed in retrospect that he may have wished at this period to make some statement or confession from which sheer terror withheld him. The morbid listening of his mother in the night brought out the fact that he made frequent sallies abroad under cover of darkness, and most of the more academic alienists unite at present in charging him with the revolting cases of vampirism which the press so sensationally reported about this time, but which have not yet been definitely traced to any known perpetrator. These cases, too recent and celebrated to need detailed mention, involved victims of every age and type and seemed to cluster around two distinct localities; the residential hill and the North End, near the Ward home, and the suburban districts across the Cranston line near Pawtuxet. Both late wayfarers and sleepers with open windows were attacked, and those who lived to tell the tale spoke unanimously of a lean, lithe, leaping monster with burning eyes which fastened its teeth in the throat or upper arm and feasted ravenously.      Dr. Willett, who refuses to date the madness of Charles Ward as far back as even this, is cautious in attempting to explain these horrors. He has, he declares, certain theories of his own; and limits his positive statements to a peculiar kind of negation. \"I will not,\" he says, \"state who or what I believe perpetrated these attacks and murders, but I will declare that Charles Ward was innocent of them. I have reason to be sure he was ignorant of the taste of blood, as indeed his continued anaemic decline and increasing pallor prove better than any verbal argument. Ward meddled with terrible things, but he has paid for it, and he was never a monster or a villain. As for now - I dont like to think. A change came, and Im content to believe that the old Charles Ward died with it. His soul did, anyhow, for that mad flesh that vanished from Waites hospital had another.\"      Willett speaks with authority, for he was often at the Ward home attending Mrs. Ward, whose nerves had begun to snap under the strain. Her nocturnal listening had bred some morbid hallucinations which she confided to the doctor with hesitancy, and which he ridiculed in talking to her, although they made him ponder deeply when alone. These delusions always concerned the faint sounds which she fancied she heard in the attic laboratory and bedroom, and emphasised the occurrence of muffled sighs and sobbings at the most impossible times. Early in July Willett ordered Mrs. Ward to Atlantic City for an indefinite recuperative sojourn, and cautioned both Mr. Ward and the haggard and elusive Charles to write her only cheering letters. It is probably to this enforced and reluctant escape that she owes her life and continued sanity.2.      Not long after his mothers departure Charles Ward began negotiating for the Pawtuxet bungalow. It was a squalid little wooden edifice with a concrete garage, perched high on the sparsely settled bank of the river slightly above Rhodes, but for some odd reason the youth would have nothing else. He gave the real-estate agencies no peace till one of them secured it for him at an exorbitant price from a somewhat reluctant owner, and as soon as it was vacant he took possession under cover of darkness, transporting in a great closed van the entire contents of his attic laboratory, including the books both weird and modern which he had borrowed from his study. He had this van loaded in the black small hours, and his father recalls only a drowsy realisation of stifled oaths and stamping feet on the night the goods were taken away. After that Charles moved back to his own old quarters on the third floor, and never haunted the attic again.      To the Pawtuxet bungalow Charles transferred all the secrecy with which he had surrounded his attic realm, save that he now appeared to have two sharers of his mysteries; a villainous-looking Portuguese half-caste from the South Main St. waterfront who acted as a servant, and a thin, scholarly stranger with dark glasses and a stubbly full beard of dyed aspect whose status was evidently that of a colleague. Neighbours vainly tried to engage these odd persons in conversation. The mulatto Gomes spoke very little English, and the bearded man, who gave his name as Dr. Allen, voluntarily followed his example. Ward himself tried to be more affable, but succeeded only in provoking curiosity with his rambling accounts of chemical research. Before long queer tales began to circulate regarding the all-night burning of lights; and somewhat later, after this burning had suddenly ceased, there rose still queerer tales of disproportionate orders of meat from the butchers and of the muffled shouting, declamation, rhythmic chanting, and screaming supposed to come from some very deep cellar below the place. Most distinctly the new and strange household was bitterly disliked by the honest bourgeoisie of the vicinity, and it is not remarkable that dark hints were advanced connecting the hated establishment with the current epidemic of vampiristic attacks and murders; especially since the radius of that plague seemed now confined wholly to Pawtuxet and the adjacent streets of Edgewood.      Ward spent most of his time at the bungalow, but slept occasionally at home and was still reckoned a dweller beneath his fathers roof. Twice he was absent from the city on week-long trips, whose destinations have not yet been discovered. He grew steadily paler and more emaciated even than before, and lacked some of his former assurance when repeating to Dr. Willett his old, old story of vital research and future revelations. Willett often waylaid him at his fathers house, for the elder Ward was deeply worried and perplexed, and wished his son to get as much sound oversight as could be managed in the case of so secretive and independent an adult. The doctor still insists that the youth was sane even as late as this, and adduces many a conversation to prove his point.      About September the vampirism declined, but in the following January Ward almost became involved in serious trouble. For some time the nocturnal arrival and departure of motor trucks at the Pawtuxet bungalow had been commented upon, and at this juncture an unforeseen hitch exposed the nature of at least one item of their contents. In a lonely spot near Hope Valley had occurred one of the frequent sordid waylayings of trucks by \"hi-jackers\" in quest of liquor shipments, but this time the robbers had been destined to receive the greater shock. For the long cases they seized proved upon opening to contain some exceedingly gruesome things; so gruesome, in fact, that the matter could not be kept quiet amongst the denizens of the underworld. The thieves had hastily buried what they discovered, but when the State Police got wind of the matter a careful search was made. A recently arrested vagrant, under promise of immunity from prosecution on any additional charge, at last consented to guide a party of troopers to the spot; and there was found in that hasty cache a very hideous and shameful thing. It would not be well for the national - or even the international - sense of decorum if the public were ever to know what was uncovered by that awestruck party. There was no mistaking it, even by these far from studious officers; and telegrams to Washington ensued with feverish rapidity.      The cases were addressed to Charles Ward at his Pawtuxet bungalow, and State and Federal officials at once paid him a very forceful and serious call. They found him pallid and worried with his two odd companions, and received from him what seemed to be a valid explanation and evidence of innocence. He had needed certain anatomical specimens as part of a programme of research whose depth and genuineness anyone who had known him in the last decade could prove, and had ordered the required kind and number from agencies which he had thought as reasonably legitimate as such things can be. Of the identity of the specimens he had known absolutely nothing, and was properly shocked when the inspectors hinted at the monstrous effect on public sentiment and national dignity which a knowledge of the matter would produce. In this statement he was firmly sustained by his bearded colleague Dr. Allen, whose oddly hollow voice carried even more conviction than his own nervous tones; so that in the end the officials took no action, but carefully set down the New York name and address which Ward gave them as a basis for a search which came to nothing. It is only fair to add that the specimens were quickly and quietly restored to their proper places, and that the general public will never know of their blasphemous disturbance.      On February 9, 1928, Dr. Willett received a letter from Charles Ward which he considers of extraordinary importance, and about which he has frequently quarrelled with Dr. Lyman. Lyman believes that this note contains positive proof of a well-developed case of dementia praecox, but Willett on the other hand regards it as the last perfectly sane utterance of the hapless youth. He calls especial attention to the normal character of the penmanship; which though shewing traces of shattered nerves, is nevertheless distinctly Wards own. The text in full is as follows:\"100 Prospect St.            Providence, R.I.,      February 8, 1928.\"Dear Dr. Willett: -       \"I feel that at last the time has come for me to make the disclosures which I have so long promised you, and for which you have pressed me so often. The patience you have shewn in waiting, and the confidence you have shewn in my mind and integrity, are things I shall never cease to appreciate.      \"And now that I am ready to speak, I must own with humiliation that no triumph such as I dreamed of can ever be mine. Instead of triumph I have found terror, and my talk with you will not be a boast of victory but a plea for help and advice in saving both myself and the world from a horror beyond all human conception or calculation. You recall what those Fenner letters said of the old raiding party at Pawtuxet. That must all be done again, and quickly. Upon us depends more than can be put into words - all civilisation, all natural law, perhaps even the fate of the solar system and the universe. I have brought to light a monstrous abnormality, but I did it for the sake of knowledge. Now for the sake of all life and Nature you must help me thrust it back into the dark again.      \"I have left that Pawtuxet place forever, and we must extirpate everything existing there, alive or dead. I shall not go there again, and you must not believe it if you ever hear that I am there. I will tell you why I say this when I see you. I have come home for good, and wish you would call on me at the very first moment that you can spare five or six hours continuously to hear what I have to say. It will take that long - and believe me when I tell you that you never had a more genuine professional duty than this. My life and reason are the very least things which hang in the balance.      \"I dare not tell my father, for he could not grasp the whole thing. But I have told him of my danger, and he has four men from a detective agency watching the house. I dont know how much good they can do, for they have against them forces which even you could scarcely envisage or acknowledge. So come quickly if you wish to see me alive and hear how you may help to save the cosmos from stark hell.      \"Any time will do - I shall not be out of the house. Dont telephone ahead, for there is no telling who or what may try to intercept you. And let us pray to whatever gods there be that nothing may prevent this meeting.      \"In utmost gravity and desperation,\"Charles Dexter Ward.\"      \"P.S. Shoot Dr. Allen on sight and dissolve his body in acid. Dont burn it.\"      Dr. Willett received this note about 10:30 a.m., and immediately arranged to spare the whole late afternoon and evening for the momentous talk, letting it extend on into the night as long as might be necessary. He planned to arrive about four oclock, and through all the intervening hours was so engulfed in every sort of wild speculation that most of his tasks were very mechanically performed. Maniacal as the letter would have sounded to a stranger, Willett had seen too much of Charles Wards oddities to dismiss it as sheer raving. That something very subtle, ancient, and horrible was hovering about he felt quite sure, and the reference to Dr. Allen could almost be comprehended in view of what Pawtuxet gossip said of Wards enigmatical colleague. Willett had never seen the man, but had heard much of his aspect and bearing, and could not but wonder what sort of eyes those much-discussed dark glasses might conceal.      Promptly at four Dr. Willett presented himself at the Ward residence, but found to his annoyance that Charles had not adhered to his determination to remain indoors. The guards were there, but said that the young man seemed to have lost part of his timidity. He had that morning done much apparently frightened arguing and protesting over the telephone, one of the detectives said, replying to some unknown voice with phrases such as \"I am very tired and must rest a while\", \"I cant receive anyone for some time, youll have to excuse me\", \"Please postpone decisive action till we can arrange some sort of compromise\", or \"I am very sorry, but I must take a complete vacation from everything; Ill talk with you later\". Then, apparently gaining boldness through meditation, he had slipped out so quietly that no one had seen him depart or knew that he had gone until he returned about one oclock and entered the house without a word. He had gone upstairs, where a bit of his fear must have surged back; for he was heard to cry out in a highly terrified fashion upon entering his library, afterward trailing off into a kind of choking gasp. When, however, the butler had gone to inquire what the trouble was, he had appeared at the door with a great show of boldness, and had silently gestured the man away in a manner that terrified him unaccountably. Then he had evidently done some rearranging of his shelves, for a great clattering and thumping and creaking ensued; after which he had reappeared and left at once. Willett inquired whether or not any message had been left, but was told that there was none. The butler seemed queerly disturbed about something in Charless appearance and manner, and asked solicitously if there was much hope for a cure of his disordered nerves.      For almost two hours Dr. Willett waited vainly in Charles Wards library, watching the dusty shelves with their wide gaps where books had been removed, and smiling grimly at the panelled overmantel on the north wall, whence a year before the suave features of old Joseph Curwen had looked mildly down. After a time the shadows began to gather, and the sunset cheer gave place to a vague growing terror which flew shadow-like before the night. Mr. Ward finally arrived, and shewed much surprise and anger at his sons absence after all the pains which had been taken to guard him. He had not known of Charless appointment, and promised to notify Willett when the youth returned. In bidding the doctor goodnight he expressed his utter perplexity at his sons condition, and urged his caller to do all he could to restore the boy to normal poise. Willett was glad to escape from that library, for something frightful and unholy seemed to haunt it; as if the vanished picture had left behind a legacy of evil. He had never liked that picture; and even now, strong-nerved though he was, there lurked a quality in its vacant panel which made him feel an urgent need to get out into the pure air as soon as possible.3.      The next morning Willett received a message from the senior Ward, saying that Charles was still absent. Mr. Ward mentioned that Dr. Allen had telephoned him to say that Charles would remain at Pawtuxet for some time, and that he must not be disturbed. This was necessary because Allen himself was suddenly called away for an indefinite period, leaving the researches in need of Charless constant oversight. Charles sent his best wishes, and regretted any bother his abrupt change of plans might have caused. In listening to this message Mr. Ward heard Dr. Allens voice for the first time, and it seemed to excite some vague and elusive memory which could not be actually placed, but which was disturbing to the point of fearfulness.      Faced by these baffling and contradictory reports, Dr. Willett was frankly at a loss what to do. The frantic earnestness of Charless note was not to be denied, yet what could one think of its writers immediate violation of his own expressed policy? Young Ward had written that his delvings had become blasphemous and menacing, that they and his bearded colleague must be extirpated at any cost, and that he himself would never return to their final scene; yet according to latest advices he had forgotten all this and was back in the thick of the mystery. Common sense bade one leave the youth alone with his freakishness, yet some deeper instinct would not permit the impression of that frenzied letter to subside. Willett read it over again, and could not make its essence sound as empty and insane as both its bombastic verbiage and its lack of fulfilment would seem to imply. Its terror was too profound and real, and in conjunction with what the doctor already knew evoked too vivid hints of monstrosities from beyond time and space to permit of any cynical explanation. There were nameless horrors abroad; and no matter how little one might be able to get at them, one ought to stand prepared for any sort of action at any time.      For over a week Dr. Willett pondered on the dilemma which seemed thrust upon him, and became more and more inclined to pay Charles a call at the Pawtuxet bungalow. No friend of the youth had ever ventured to storm this forbidden retreat, and even his father knew of its interior only from such descriptions as he chose to give; but Willett felt that some direct conversation with his patient was necessary. Mr. Ward had been receiving brief and non-committal typed notes from his son, and said that Mrs. Ward in her Atlantic City retirement had had no better word. So at length the doctor resolved to act; and despite a curious sensation inspired by old legends of Joseph Curwen, and by more recent revelations and warnings from Charles Ward, set boldly out for the bungalow on the bluff above the river.      Willett had visited the spot before through sheer curiosity, though of course never entering the house or proclaiming his presence; hence knew exactly the route to take. Driving out Broad Street one early afternoon toward the end of February in his small motor, he thought oddly of the grim party which had taken that selfsame road a hundred and fifty-seven years before on a terrible errand which none might ever comprehend.      The ride through the citys decaying fringe was short, and trim Edgewood and sleepy Pawtuxet presently spread out ahead. Willett turned to the right down Lockwood Street and drove his car as far along that rural road as he could, then alighted and walked north to where the bluff towered above the lovely bends of the river and the sweep of misty downlands beyond. Houses were still few here, and there was no mistaking the isolated bungalow with its concrete garage on a high point of land at his left. Stepping briskly up the neglected gravel walk he rapped at the door with a firm hand, and spoke without a tremor to the evil Portuguese mulatto who opened it to the width of a crack.      He must, he said, see Charles Ward at once on vitally important business. No excuse would be accepted, and a repulse would mean only a full report of the matter to the elder Ward. The mulatto still hesitated, and pushed against the door when Willett attempted to open it; but the doctor merely raised his voice and renewed his demands. Then there came from the dark interior a husky whisper which somehow chilled the hearer through and through though he did not know why he feared it. \"Let him in, Tony,\" it said, \"we may as well talk now as ever.\" But disturbing as was the whisper, the greater fear was that which immediately followed. The floor creaked and the speaker hove in sight - and the owner of those strange and resonant tones was seen to be no other than Charles Dexter Ward.      The minuteness with which Dr. Willett recalled and recorded his conversation of that afternoon is due to the importance he assigns to this particular period. For at last he concedes a vital change in Charles Dexter Wards mentality, and believes that the youth now spoke from a brain hopelessly alien to the brain whose growth he had watched for six and twenty years. Controversy with Dr. Lyman has compelled him to be very specific, and he definitely dates the madness of Charles Ward from the time the typewritten notes began to reach his parents. Those notes are not in Wards normal style; not even in the style of that last frantic letter to Willett. Instead, they are strange and archaic, as if the snapping of the writers mind had released a flood of tendencies and impressions picked up unconsciously through boyhood antiquarianism. There is an obvious effort to be modern, but the spirit and occasionally the language are those of the past.      The past, too, was evident in Wards every tone and gesture as he received the doctor in that shadowy bungalow. He bowed, motioned Willett to a seat, and began to speak abruptly in that strange whisper which he sought to explain at the very outset.      \"I am grown phthisical,\" he began, \"from this cursed river air. You must excuse my speech. I suppose you are come from my father to see what ails me, and I hope you will say nothing to alarm him.\"      Willett was studying these scraping tones with extreme care, but studying even more closely the face of the speaker. Something, he felt, was wrong; and he thought of what the family had told him about the fright of that Yorkshire butler one night. He wished it were not so dark, but did not request that any blind be opened. Instead, he merely asked Ward why he had so belied the frantic note of little more than a week before.      \"I was coming to that,\" the host replied. \"You must know, I am in a very bad state of nerves, and do and say queer things I cannot account for. As I have told you often, I am on the edge of great matters; and the bigness of them has a way of making me light-headed. Any man might well be frighted of what I have found, but I am not to be put off for long. I was a dunce to have that guard and stick at home; for having gone this far, my place is here. I am not well spoke of by my prying neighbours, and perhaps I was led by weakness to believe myself what they say of me. There is no evil to any in what I do, so long as I do it rightly. Have the goodness to wait six months, and Ill shew you what will pay your patience well.      \"You may as well know I have a way of learning old matters from things surer than books, and Ill leave you to judge the importance of what I can give to history, philosophy, and the arts by reason of the doors I have access to. My ancestor had all this when those witless peeping Toms came and murdered him. I now have it again, or am coming very imperfectly to have a part of it. This time nothing must happen, and least of all through any idiot fears of my own. Pray forget all I writ you, Sir, and have no fear of this place or any in it. Dr. Allen is a man of fine parts, and I owe him an apology for anything ill I have said of him. I wish I had no need to spare him, but there were things he had to do elsewhere. His zeal is equal to mine in all those matters, and I suppose that when I feared the work I feared him too as my greatest helper in it.\"      Ward paused, and the doctor hardly knew what to say or think. He felt almost foolish in the face of this calm repudiation of the letter; and yet there clung to him the fact that while the present discourse was strange and alien and indubitably mad, the note itself had been tragic in its naturalness and likeness to the Charles Ward he knew. Willett now tried to turn the talk on early matters, and recall to the youth some past events which would restore a familiar mood; but in this process he obtained only the most grotesque results. It was the same with all the alienists later on. Important sections of Charles Wards store of mental images, mainly those touching modern times and his own personal life, had been unaccountably expunged; whilst all the massed antiquarianism of his youth had welled up from some profound subconsciousness to engulf the contemporary and the individual. The youths intimate knowledge of elder things was abnormal and unholy, and he tried his best to hide it. When Willett would mention some favourite object of his boyhood archaistic studies he often shed by pure accident such a light as no normal mortal could conceivably be expected to possess, and the doctor shuddered as the glib allusion glided by.      It was not wholesome to know so much about the way the fat sheriffs wig fell off as he leaned over at the play in Mr. Douglass Histrionick Academy in King Street on the eleventh of February, 1762, which fell on a Thursday; or about how the actors cut the text of Steeles Conscious Lovers so badly that one was almost glad the Baptist-ridden legislature closed the theatre a fortnight later. That Thomas Sabins Boston coach was \"damnd uncomfortable\" old letters may well have told; but what healthy antiquarian could recall how the creaking of Epenetus Olneys new signboard (the gaudy crown he set up after he took to calling his tavern the Crown Coffee House) was exactly like the first few notes of the new jazz piece all the radios in Pawtuxet were playing?      Ward, however, would not be quizzed long in this vein. Modern and personal topics he waved aside quite summarily, whilst regarding antique affairs he soon shewed the plainest boredom. What he wished clearly enough was only to satisfy his visitor enough to make him depart without the intention of returning. To this end he offered to shew Willett the entire house, and at once proceeded to lead the doctor through every room from cellar to attic. Willett looked sharply, but noted that the visible books were far too few and trivial ever to have filled the wide gaps on Wards shelves at home, and that the meagre so-called \"laboratory\" was the flimsiest sort of a blind. Clearly there were a library and a laboratory elsewhere; but just where, it was impossible to say. Essentially defeated in his quest for something he could not name, Willett returned to town before evening and told the senior Ward everything which had occurred. They agreed that the youth must be definitely out of his mind, but decided that nothing drastic need be done just then. Above all, Mrs. Ward must be kept in as complete an ignorance as her sons own strange typed notes would permit.      Mr. Ward now determined to call in person upon his son, making it wholly a surprise visit. Dr. Willett took him in his car one evening, guiding him to within sight of the bungalow and waiting patiently for his return. The session was a long one, and the father emerged in a very saddened and perplexed state. His reception had developed much like Willetts, save that Charles had been an excessively long time in appearing after the visitor had forced his way into the hall and sent the Portuguese away with an imperative demand; and in the bearing of the altered son there was no trace of filial affection. The lights had been dim, yet even so the youth had complained that they dazzled him outrageously. He had not spoken out loud at all, averring that his throat was in very poor condition; but in his hoarse whisper there was a quality so vaguely disturbing that Mr. Ward could not banish it from his mind.      Now definitely leagued together to do all they could toward the youths mental salvation, Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett set about collecting every scrap of data which the case might afford. Pawtuxet gossip was the first item they studied, and this was relatively easy to glean since both had friends in that region. Dr. Willett obtained the most rumours because people talked more frankly to him than to a parent of the central figure, and from all he heard he could tell that young Wards life had become indeed a strange one. Common tongues would not dissociate his household from the vampirism of the previous summer, while the nocturnal comings and goings of the motor trucks provided their share of dark speculation. Local tradesmen spoke of the queerness of the orders brought them by the evil-looking mulatto, and in particular of the inordinate amounts of meat and fresh blood secured from the two butcher shops in the immediate neighbourhood. For a household of only three, these quantities were quite absurd.      Then there was the matter of the sounds beneath the earth. Reports of these things were harder to pin down, but all the vague hints tallied in certain basic essentials. Noises of a ritual nature positively existed, and at times when the bungalow was dark. They might, of course, have come from the known cellar; but rumour insisted that there were deeper and more spreading crypts. Recalling the ancient tales of Joseph Curwens catacombs, and assuming for granted that the present bungalow had been selected because of its situation on the old Curwen site as revealed in one or another of the documents found behind the picture, Willett and Mr. Ward gave this phase of the gossip much attention; and searched many times without success for the door in the river-bank which old manuscripts mentioned. As to popular opinions of the bungalows various inhabitants, it was soon plain that the Brava Portuguese was loathed, the bearded and spectacled Dr. Allen feared, and the pallid young scholar disliked to a profound extent. During the last week or two Ward had obviously changed much, abandoning his attempts at affability and speaking only in hoarse but oddly repellent whispers on the few occasions that he ventured forth.      Such were the shreds and fragments gathered here and there; and over these Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett held many long and serious conferences. They strove to exercise deduction, induction, and constructive imagination to their utmost extent; and to correlate every known fact of Charless later life, including the frantic letter which the doctor now shewed the father, with the meagre documentary evidence available concerning old Joseph Curwen. They would have given much for a glimpse of the papers Charles had found, for very clearly the key to the youths madness lay in what he had learned of the ancient wizard and his doings.4.      And yet, after all, it was from no step of Mr. Wards or Dr. Willetts that the next move in this singular case proceeded. The father and the physician, rebuffed and confused by a shadow too shapeless and intangible to combat, had rested uneasily on their oars while the typed notes of young Ward to his parents grew fewer and fewer. Then came the first of the month with its customary financial adjustments, and the clerks at certain banks began a peculiar shaking of heads and telephoning from one to the other. Officials who knew Charles Ward by sight went down to the bungalow to ask why every cheque of his appearing at this juncture was a clumsy forgery, and were reassurred less than they ought to have been when the youth hoarsely explained that his hand had lately been so much affected by a nervous shock as to make normal writing impossible. He could, he said, form no written characters at all except with great difficulty; and could prove it by the fact that he had been forced to type all his recent letters, even those to his father and mother, who would bear out the assertion.      What made the investigators pause in confusion was not this circumstance alone, for that was nothing unprecedented or fundamentally suspicious; nor even the Pawtuxet gossip, of which one or two of them had caught echoes. It was the muddled discourse of the young man which nonplussed them, implying as it did a virtually total loss of memory concerning important monetary matters which he had had at his fingertips only a month or two before. Something was wrong; for despite the apparent coherence and rationality of his speech, there could be no normal reason for this ill-concealed blankness on vital points. Moreover, although none of these men knew Ward well, they could not help observing the change in his language and manner. They had heard he was an antiquarian, but even the most hopeless antiquarians do not make daily use of obsolete phraseology and gestures. Altogether, this combination of hoarseness, palsied hands, bad memory, and altered speech and bearing must represent some disturbance or malady of genuine gravity, which no doubt formed the basis of the prevailing odd rumours; and after their departure the party of officials decided that a talk with the senior Ward was imperative.      So on the sixth of March, 1928, there was a long and serious conference in Mr. Wards office, after which the utterly bewildered father summoned Dr. Willett in a kind of helpless resignation. Willett looked over the strained and awkward signatures of the cheques, and compared them in his mind with the penmanship of that last frantic note. Certainly, the change was radical and profound, and yet there was something damnably familiar about the new writing. It had crabbed and archaic tendencies of a very curious sort, and seemed to result from a type of stroke utterly different from that which the youth had always used. It was strange - but where had he seen it before? On the whole, it was obvious that Charles was insane. Of that there could be no doubt. And since it appeared unlikely that he could handle his property or continue to deal with the outside world much longer, something must quickly be done toward his oversight and possible cure. It was then that the alienists were called in, Drs. Peck and Waite of Providence and Dr. Lyman of Boston, to whom Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett gave the most exhaustive possible history of the case, and who conferred at length in the now unused library of their young patient, examining what books and papers of his were left in order to gain some further notion of his habitual mental cast. After scanning this material and examining the ominous note to Willett they all agreed that Charles Wards studies had been enough to unseat or at least to warp any ordinary intellect, and wished most heartily that they could see his more intimate volumes and documents; but this latter they knew they could do, if at all, only after a scene at the bungalow itself. Willett now reviewed the whole case with febrile energy; it being at this time that he obtained the statements of the workmen who had seen Charles find the Curwen documents, and that he collated the incidents of the destroyed newspaper items, looking up the latter at the Journal office.      On Thursday, the eighth of March, Drs. Willett, Peck, Lyman, and Waite, accompanied by Mr. Ward, paid the youth their momentous call; making no concealment of their object and questioning the now acknowledged patient with extreme minuteness. Charles, though he was inordinately long in answering the summons and was still redolent of strange and noxious laboratory odours when he did finally make his agitated appearance, proved a far from recalcitrant subject; and admitted freely that his memory and balance had suffered somewhat from close application to abstruse studies. He offered no resistance when his removal to other quarters was insisted upon; and seemed, indeed, to display a high degree of intelligence as apart from mere memory. His conduct would have sent his interviewers away in bafflement had not the persistently archaic trend of his speech and unmistakable replacement of modern by ancient ideas in his consciousness marked him out as one definitely removed from the normal. Of his work he would say no more to the group of doctors than he had formerly said to his family and to Dr. Willett, and his frantic note of the previous month he dismissed as mere nerves and hysteria. He insisted that this shadowy bungalow possessed no library or laboratory beyond the visible ones, and waxed abstruse in explaining the absence from the house of such odours as now saturated all his clothing. Neighbourhood gossip he attributed to nothing more than the cheap inventiveness of baffled curiosity. Of the whereabouts of Dr. Allen he said he did not feel at liberty to speak definitely, but assured his inquisitors that the bearded and spectacled man would return when needed. In paying off the stolid Brava who resisted all questioning by the visitors, and in closing the bungalow which still seemed to hold such nighted secrets, Ward shewed no sign of nervousness save a barely noticed tendency to pause as though listening for something very faint. He was apparently animated by a calmly philosophic resignation, as if his removal were the merest transient incident which would cause the least trouble if facilitated and disposed of once and for all. It was clear that he trusted to his obviously unimpaired keenness of absolute mentality to overcome all the embarrassments into which his twisted memory, his lost voice and handwriting, and his secretive and eccentric behaviour had led him. His mother, it was agreed, was not to be told of the change; his father supplying typed notes in his name. Ward was taken to the restfully and picturesquely situated private hospital maintained by Dr. Waite on Conanicut Island in the bay, and subjected to the closest scrutiny and questioning by all the physicians connected with the case. It was then that the physical oddities were noticed; the slackened metabolism, the altered skin, and the disproportionate neural reactions. Dr. Willett was the most perturbed of the various examiners, for he had attended Ward all his life and could appreciate with terrible keenness the extent of his physical disorganisation. Even the familiar olive mark on his hip was gone, while on his chest was a great black mole or cicatrice which had never been there before, and which made Willett wonder whether the youth had ever submitted to any of the \"witch markings\" reputed to be inflicted at certain unwholesome nocturnal meetings in wild and lonely places. The doctor could not keep his mind off a certain transcribed witch-trial record from Salem which Charles had shewn him in the old non-secretive days, and which read: \"Mr. G. B. on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B.\" Wards face, too, troubled him horribly, till at length he suddenly discovered why he was horrified. For above the young mans right eye was something which he had never previously noticed - a small scar or pit precisely like that in the crumbled painting of old Joseph Curwen, and perhaps attesting some hideous ritualistic inoculation to which both had submitted at a certain stage of their occult careers.      While Ward himself was puzzling all the doctors at the hospital a very strict watch was kept on all mail addressed either to him or to Dr. Allen, which Mr. Ward had ordered delivered at the family home. Willett had predicted that very little would be found, since any communications of a vital nature would probably have been exchanged by messenger; but in the latter part of March there did come a letter from Prague for Dr. Allen which gave both the doctor and the father deep thought. It was in a very crabbed and archaic hand; and though clearly not the effort of a foreigner, shewed almost as singular a departure from modern English as the speech of young Ward himself. It read:Kleinstrasse 11,            Altstadt, Prague,      11th Feby. 1928.Brother in Almousin-Metraton: -       I this day receivd yr mention of what came up from the Salts I sent you.

C. inProvidence.      Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett paused in utter chaos before this apparent bit of unrelieved insanity. Only by degrees did they absorb what it seemed to imply. So the absent Dr. Allen, and not Charles Ward, had come to be the leading spirit at Pawtuxet? That must explain the wild reference and denunciation in the youths last frantic letter. And what of this addressing of the bearded and spectacled stranger as \"Mr. J. C.\"? There was no escaping the inference, but there are limits to possible monstrosity. Who was \"Simon O.\"; the old man Ward had visited in Prague four years previously? Perhaps, but in the centuries behind there had been another Simon O. - Simon Orne, alias Jedediah, of Salem, who vanished in 1771, and whose peculiar handwriting Dr. Willett now unmistakably recognised from the photostatic copies of the Orne formulae which Charles had once shewn him. What horrors and mysteries, what contradictions and contraventions of Nature, had come back after a century and a half to harass Old Providence with her clustered spires and domes?      The father and the old physician, virtually at a loss what to do or think, went to see Charles at the hospital and questioned him as delicately as they could about Dr. Allen, about the Prague visit, and about what he had learned of Simon or Jedediah Orne of Salem. To all these inquiries the youth was politely non-committal, merely barking in his hoarse whisper that he had found Dr. Allen to have a remarkable spiritual rapport with certain souls from the past, and that any correspondent the bearded man might have in Prague would probably be similarly gifted. When they left, Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett realised to their chagrin that they had really been the ones under catechism; and that without imparting anything vital himself, the confined youth had adroitly pumped them of everything the Prague letter had contained.      Drs. Peck, Waite, and Lyman were not inclined to attach much importance to the strange correspondence of young Wards companion; for they knew the tendency of kindred eccentrics and monomaniacs to band together, and believed that Charles or Allen had merely unearthed an expatriated counterpart - perhaps one who had seen Ornes handwriting and copied it in an attempt to pose as the bygone characters reincarnation. Allen himself was perhaps a similar case, and may have persuaded the youth into accepting him as an avatar of the long-dead Curwen. Such things had been known before, and on the same basis the hard-headed doctors disposed of Willetts growing disquiet about Charles Wards present handwriting, as studied from unpremeditated specimens obtained by various ruses. Willett thought he had placed its odd familiarity at last, and that what it vaguely resembled was the bygone penmanship of old Joseph Curwen himself; but this the other physicians regarded as a phase of imitativeness only to be expected in a mania of this sort, and refused to grant it any importance either favourable or unfavourable. Recognising this prosaic attitude in his colleagues, Willett advised Mr. Ward to keep to himself the letter which arrived for Dr. Allen on the second of April from Rakus, Transylvania, in a handwriting so intensely and fundamentally like that of the Hutchinson cipher that both father and physician paused in awe before breaking the seal.

These Roumanians plague me damnably, being officious and particular where you coud buy a Magyar off with a Drinke and ffood. Last monthe M. got me ye Sarcophagus of ye Five Sphinxes from ye Acropolis where He whome I calld up sayd it woud be, and I have hadde 3 Talkes with What was therein inhumd. It will go to S. O. in Prague directly, and thence to you. It is stubborn but you know ye Way with Such. You shew Wisdom in having lesse about than Before; for there was no Neede to keep the Guards in Shape and eatg off their Heads, and it made Much to be founde in Case of Trouble, as you too welle knowe. You can now move and worke elsewhere with no Killg Trouble if needful, tho I hope no Thing will soon force you to so Bothersome a Course. I rejoice that you traffick not so much with Those Outside; for there was ever a Mortall Peril in it, and you are sensible what it did when you askd Protection of One not disposd to give it. You excel me in gettg ye fformulae so another may saye them with Success, but Borellus fancyd it woud be so if just ye right Wordes were hadd. Does ye Boy use em often? I regret that he growes squeamish, as I feard he woud when I hadde him here nigh 15 Monthes, but am sensible you knowe how to deal with him. You cant saye him down with ye fformula, for that will Worke only upon such as ye other fformula hath calld up from Saltes; but you still have strong Handes and Knife and Pistol, and Graves are not harde to digg, nor Acids loth to burne.

Have Confidence in what I saye, for you knowe O. and I have hadd these 150 yeares more than you to consulte these Matters in.Nephren-Ka nai HadothEdw: H.For J. Curwen, Esq.Providence.      But if Willett and Mr. Ward refrained from shewing this letter to the alienists, they did not refrain from acting upon it themselves. No amount of learned sophistry could controvert the fact that the strangely bearded and spectacled Dr. Allen, of whom Charless frantic letter had spoken as such a monstrous menace, was in close and sinister correspondence with two inexplicable creatures whom Ward had visited in his travels and who plainly claimed to be survivals or avatars of Curwens old Salem colleagues; that he was regarding himself as the reincarnation of Joseph Curwen, and that he entertained - or was at least advised to entertain - murderous designs against a \"boy\" who could scarcely be other than Charles Ward. There was organised horror afoot; and no matter who had started it, the missing Allen was by this time at the bottom of it. Therefore, thanking heaven that Charles was now safe in the hospital, Mr. Ward lost no time in engaging detectives to learn all they could of the cryptic bearded doctor; finding whence he had come and what Pawtuxet knew of him, and if possible discovering his current whereabouts. Supplying the men with one of the bungalow keys which Charles yielded up, he urged them to explore Allens vacant room which had been identified when the patients belongings had been packed; obtaining what clues they could from any effects he might have left about. Mr. Ward talked with the detectives in his sons old library, and they felt a marked relief when they left it at last; for there seemed to hover about the place a vague aura of evil. Perhaps it was what they had heard of the infamous old wizard whose picture had once stared from the panelled overmantel, and perhaps it was something different and irrelevant; but in any case they all half sensed an intangible miasma which centred in that carven vestige of an older dwelling and which at times almost rose to the intensity of a material emanation.", "\"You fool, Warren is DEAD!\"As soon as the demonic and bestial voice had finished its horrifying utterance, my fear, which had spent the last several minutes of my final, despairing conversation with Warren in a state of suspended animation waiting in vain to hear of my friends hopeful escape, spread from my chest to my head and from there, spread like a cold sensation through my veins, filling me with a terrified despairing sensation that I had never experienced before. I was paralyzed by my fear. My legs gave out, and I collapsed on the floor of the tomb. Suddenly the blackness closed in, and I knew no more.I woke up the next day to the muted yet familiar smell of sterilized linens. After my disorientation dissipated, I realized that I had been taken to the local hospital. From Warrens research into the entrance to the netherworld, we had discovered that the areas surrounding the entrances were feared by local peoples, and were feared and avoided.A mild sense of comfort filled me as I realized that whatever entity had taken my friend from this mortal realm had not escaped its netherworld lair. Its words haunted my thoughts, resonating in my mind like a bell. Shortly after my awakening, a nurse entered my room to tell me that the sheriff had asked for me.Soon after, a stout, short man entered the room. He had a worried look on his face. I could tell that whatever he wanted to discuss with me was done with great reluctance and anxiety. He stuttered through a short introduction, his name being Alan Graham. He had said he had found me after he had received reports from some of the local people near the graveyard, that two grave robbers had been trespassing onto the forbidden lands. He had found me unconscious in the tomb, but had not seen or heard anything. He was obviously spooked by the dilapidated structures in the swamp and had taken me to the hospital. He asked me of what happened to the man that witnesses saw me enter the swamp with.I was filled with an inhumane dread at the thought of telling the oblivious detective of my experience in the graveyard. However, I braved through my fear, though had to take several pauses to avoid becoming overcome with fear and passing out again. By the time, I had finished, Graham had begun sobbing uncontrollably, He had started shaking as big, wet tears dropped down his face. Though I dont understand why, he had believed my tale. Graham told me that I could leave, as long as I didnt go back to the graveyard. I agreed, heaving no desire to return the horror that had taken Warren from this life.The next four months of my life were haunted by nightmares of the disembodied voice talking to me through the grave. Though I attempted to forget that night, my mind would always take me back to the graveyard. While my mind was filled with immense terror of what I had observed, I was so curious as to what Warren had unearthed in that hidden necropolis. The thoughts of the latter slowly consumed my thoughts, and I was unable to function in society. I was resolved to find out what Warren had unearthed. However, I was aware of the danger I faced, and decided I would go back by myself. If I died, I would take the knowledge of the location of the portal to the underworld with me.I returned the following autumn, having read up on the lore that Warren had kept hidden me, from my own protection. The tomes he had uncovered told tales of the monstrous demons that could travel between the underworld and the surface one. The tomes were mostly undecipherable to me, as my linguistic ability was not strong enough to decipher the archaic texts. However, I was able to make out the basic information, though none of the stories told me of a way to prevent being killed or how to hide myself from the undead beings.Despite the bleakness of my remaining mortality, my curiosity of the hidden world that only a few mortals had ever seen grew stronger and stronger, dominating my thoughts. I knew I had to return, even though I would likely die.When I returned to the cemetery, I was unsurprised that everything had remained completely the same. The equipment Warren and I had brought had remained untouched, the telephone wire still being in place. My mind quickly focused on Warren, would I discover his remains, if the demons had even left his body? I removed the black slab covering the entrance, though it too much longer than when I had Warren helping me. Nevertheless, I was able to move the stone. However, I was only able to budge it so that it would eventually close on the doorway, trapping me inside.Though I knew my life would be lost, my curiosity had taken over me, and I knew that until I had seen what horrors or wonder were hidden beneath the tomb, I could not find peace. So, I set off into the darkness. These are the final thoughts I have before I leave this world. To whoever discovers this note next to this other worldly gateway, the horrors beneath this tomb have consumed my life, and for your sake, I pray that you do not become entrapped into its ethereal mystique as I have. Run, you fool, run, before you are trapped in spirit and in body as I am! Run, before the obsession takes over your every waking thought! Leave!- Randolph Carter"]}
{"id": "EN002", "pair": ["V. A Nightmare and a Cataclysm1.And now swiftly followed that hideous experience which has left its indelible mark of fear on the soul of Marinus Bicknell Willett, and has added a decade to the visible age of one whose youth was even then far behind. Dr. Willett had conferred at length with Mr. Ward, and had come to an agreement with him on several points which both felt the alienists would ridicule. There was, they conceded, a terrible movement alive in the world, whose direct connexion with a necromancy even older than the Salem witchcraft could not be doubted. That at least two living men - and one other of whom they dared not think - were in absolute possession of minds or personalities which had functioned as early as 1690 or before was likewise almost unassailably proved even in the face of all known natural laws. What these horrible creatures - and Charles Ward as well - were doing or trying to do seemed fairly clear from their letters and from every bit of light both old and new which had filtered in upon the case. They were robbing the tombs of all the ages, including those of the worlds wisest and greatest men, in the hope of recovering from the bygone ashes some vestige of the consciousness and lore which had once animated and informed them.      A hideous traffick was going on among these nightmare ghouls, whereby illustrious bones were bartered with the calm calculativeness of schoolboys swapping books; and from what was extorted from this centuried dust there was anticipated a power and a wisdom beyond anything which the cosmos had ever seen concentrated in one man or group. They had found unholy ways to keep their brains alive, either in the same body or different bodies; and had evidently achieved a way of tapping the consciousness of the dead whom they gathered together. There had, it seems, been some truth in chimerical old Borellus when he wrote of preparing from even the most antique remains certain \"Essential Saltes\" from which the shade of a long-dead living thing might be raised up. There was a formula for evoking such a shade, and another for putting it down; and it had now been so perfected that it could be taught successfully. One must be careful about evocations, for the markers of old graves are not always accurate.      Willett and Mr. Ward shivered as they passed from conclusion to conclusion. Things - presences or voices of some sort - could be drawn down from unknown places as well as from the grave, and in this process also one must be careful. Joseph Curwen had indubitably evoked many forbidden things, and as for Charles - what might one think of him? What forces \"outside the spheres\" had reached him from Joseph Curwens day and turned his mind on forgotten things? He had been led to find certain directions, and he had used them. He had talked with the man of horror in Prague and stayed long with the creature in the mountains of Transylvania. And he must have found the grave of Joseph Curwen at last. That newspaper item and what his mother had heard in the night were too significant to overlook. Then he had summoned something, and it must have come. That mighty voice aloft on Good Friday, and those different tones in the locked attic laboratory. What were they like, with their depth and hollowness? Was there not here some awful foreshadowing of the dreaded stranger Dr. Allen with his spectral bass? Yes, that was what Mr. Ward had felt with vague horror in his single talk with the man - if man it were - over the telephone!      What hellish consciousness or voice, what morbid shade or presence, had come to answer Charles Wards secret rites behind that locked door? Those voices heard in argument - \"must have it red for three months\" - Good God! Was not that just before the vampirism broke out? The rifling of Ezra Weedens ancient grave, and the cries later at Pawtuxet - whose mind had planned the vengeance and rediscovered the shunned seat of elder blasphemies? And then the bungalow and the bearded stranger, and the gossip, and the fear. The final madness of Charles neither father nor doctor could attempt to explain, but they did feel sure that the mind of Joseph Curwen had come to earth again and was following its ancient morbidities. Was daemoniac possession in truth a possibility? Allen had something to do with it, and the detectives must find out more about one whose existence menaced the young mans life. In the meantime, since the existence of some vast crypt beneath the bungalow seemed virtually beyond dispute, some effort must be made to find it. Willett and Mr. Ward, conscious of the sceptical attitude of the alienists, resolved during their final conference to undertake a joint secret exploration of unparalleled thoroughness; and agreed to meet at the bungalow on the following morning with valises and with certain tools and accessories suited to architectural search and underground exploration.      The morning of April 6th dawned clear, and both explorers were at the bungalow by ten oclock. Mr. Ward had the key, and an entry and cursory survey were made. From the disordered condition of Dr. Allens room it was obvious that the detectives had been there before, and the later searchers hoped that they had found some clue which might prove of value. Of course the main business lay in the cellar; so thither they descended without much delay, again making the circuit which each had vainly made before in the presence of the mad young owner. For a time everything seemed baffling, each inch of the earthen floor and stone walls having so solid and innocuous an aspect that the thought of a yawning aperture was scarcely to be entertained. Willett reflected that since the original cellar was dug without knowledge of any catacombs beneath, the beginning of the passage would represent the strictly modern delving of young Ward and his associates, where they had probed for the ancient vaults whose rumour could have reached them by no wholesome means.      The doctor tried to put himself in Charless place to see how a delver would be likely to start, but could not gain much inspiration from this method. Then he decided on elimination as a policy, and went carefully over the whole subterranean surface both vertical and horizontal, trying to account for every inch separately. He was soon substantially narrowed down, and at last had nothing left but the small platform before the washtubs, which he had tried once before in vain. Now experimenting in every possible way, and exerting a double strength, he finally found that the top did indeed turn and slide horizontally on a corner pivot. Beneath it lay a trim concrete surface with an iron manhole, to which Mr. Ward at once rushed with excited zeal. The cover was not hard to lift, and the father had quite removed it when Willett noticed the queerness of his aspect. He was swaying and nodding dizzily, and in the gust of noxious air which swept up from the black pit beneath the doctor soon recognised ample cause.      In a moment Dr. Willett had his fainting companion on the floor above and was reviving him with cold water. Mr. Ward responded feebly, but it could be seen that the mephitic blast from the crypt had in some way gravely sickened him. Wishing to take no chances, Willett hastened out to Broad Street for a taxicab and had soon dispatched the sufferer home despite his weak-voiced protests; after which he produced an electric torch, covered his nostrils with a band of sterile gauze, and descended once more to peer into the new-found depths. The foul air had now slightly abated, and Willett was able to send a beam of light down the Stygian hole. For about ten feet, he saw, it was a sheer cylindrical drop with concrete walls and an iron ladder; after which the hole appeared to strike a flight of old stone steps which must originally have emerged to earth somewhat southwest of the present building.2.      Willett freely admits that for a moment the memory of the old Curwen legends kept him from climbing down alone into that malodorous gulf. He could not help thinking of what Luke Fenner had reported on that last monstrous night. Then duty asserted itself and he made the plunge, carrying a great valise for the removal of whatever papers might prove of supreme importance. Slowly, as befitted one of his years, he descended the ladder and reached the slimy steps below. This was ancient masonry, his torch told him; and upon the dripping walls he saw the unwholesome moss of centuries. Down, down, ran the steps; not spirally, but in three abrupt turns; and with such narrowness that two men could have passed only with difficulty. He had counted about thirty when a sound reached him very faintly; and after that he did not feel disposed to count any more.      It was a godless sound; one of those low-keyed, insidious outrages of Nature which are not meant to be. To call it a dull wail, a doom-dragged whine, or a hopeless howl of chorused anguish and stricken flesh without mind would be to miss its most quintessential loathsomeness and soul-sickening overtones. Was it for this that Ward had seemed to listen on that day he was removed? It was the most shocking thing that Willett had ever heard, and it continued from no determinate point as the doctor reached the bottom of the steps and cast his torchlight around on lofty corridor walls surmounted by Cyclopean vaulting and pierced by numberless black archways. The hall in which he stood was perhaps fourteen feet high to the middle of the vaulting and ten or twelve feet broad. Its pavement was of large chipped flagstones, and its walls and roof were of dressed masonry. Its length he could not imagine, for it stretched ahead indefinitely into the blackness. Of the archways, some had doors of the old six-panelled colonial type, whilst others had none.      Overcoming the dread induced by the smell and the howling, Willett began to explore these archways one by one; finding beyond them rooms with groined stone ceilings, each of medium size and apparently of bizarre uses. Most of them had fireplaces, the upper courses of whose chimneys would have formed an interesting study in engineering. Never before or since had he seen such instruments or suggestions of instruments as here loomed up on every hand through the burying dust and cobwebs of a century and a half, in many cases evidently shattered as if by the ancient raiders. For many of the chambers seemed wholly untrodden by modern feet, and must have represented the earliest and most obsolete phases of Joseph Curwens experimentation. Finally there came a room of obvious modernity, or at least of recent occupancy. There were oil heaters, bookshelves and tables, chairs and cabinets, and a desk piled high with papers of varying antiquity and contemporaneousness. Candlesticks and oil lamps stood about in several places; and finding a match-safe handy, Willett lighted such as were ready for use.      In the fuller gleam it appeared that this apartment was nothing less than the latest study or library of Charles Ward. Of the books the doctor had seen many before, and a good part of the furniture had plainly come from the Prospect Street mansion. Here and there was a piece well known to Willett, and the sense of familiarity became so great that he half forgot the noisomeness and the wailing, both of which were plainer here than they had been at the foot of the steps. His first duty, as planned long ahead, was to find and seize any papers which might seem of vital importance; especially those portentous documents found by Charles so long ago behind the picture in Olney Court. As he searched he perceived how stupendous a task the final unravelling would be; for file on file was stuffed with papers in curious hands and bearing curious designs, so that months or even years might be needed for a thorough deciphering and editing. Once he found large packets of letters with Prague and Rakus postmarks, and in writing clearly recognisable as Ornes and Hutchinsons; all of which he took with him as part of the bundle to be removed in his valise.      At last, in a locked mahogany cabinet once gracing the Ward home, Willett found the batch of old Curwen papers; recognising them from the reluctant glimpse Charles had granted him so many years ago. The youth had evidently kept them together very much as they had been when first he found them, since all the titles recalled by the workmen were present except the papers addressed to Orne and Hutchinson, and the cipher with its key. Willett placed the entire lot in his valise and continued his examination of the files. Since young Wards immediate condition was the greatest matter at stake, the closest searching was done among the most obviously recent matter; and in this abundance of contemporary manuscript one very baffling oddity was noted. The oddity was the slight amount in Charless normal writing, which indeed included nothing more recent than two months before. On the other hand, there were literally reams of symbols and formulae, historical notes and philosophical comment, in a crabbed penmanship absolutely identical with the ancient script of Joseph Curwen, though of undeniably modern dating. Plainly, a part of the latter-day programme had been a sedulous imitation of the old wizards writing, which Charles seemed to have carried to a marvellous state of perfection. Of any third hand which might have been Allens there was not a trace. If he had indeed come to be the leader, he must have forced young Ward to act as his amanuensis.      In this new material one mystic formula, or rather pair of formulae, recurred so often that Willett had it by heart before he had half finished his quest. It consisted of two parallel columns, the left-hand one surmounted by the archaic symbol called \"Dragons Head\" and used in almanacks to indicate the ascending node, and the right-hand one headed by a corresponding sign of \"Dragons Tail\" or descending node. The appearance of the whole was something like this, and almost unconsciously the doctor realised that the second half was no more than the first written syllabically backward with the exception of the final monosyllables and of the odd name Yog-Sothoth, which he had come to recognise under various spellings from other things he had seen in connexion with this horrible matter. The formulae were as follows - exactly so, as Willett is abundantly able to testify - and the first one struck an odd note of uncomfortable latent memory in his brain, which he recognised later when reviewing the events of that horrible Good Friday of the previous year.YAI NGNGAH,YOG-SOTHOTHHEE - LGEBFAI THRODOGUAAAH      \tOGTHROD AIFGEBL - EEHYOG-SOTHOTHNGAHNG AIYZHROSo haunting were these formulae, and so frequently did he come upon them, that before the doctor knew it he was repeating them under his breath. Eventually, however, he felt he had secured all the papers he could digest to advantage for the present; hence resolved to examine no more till he could bring the sceptical alienists en masse for an ampler and more systematic raid. He had still to find the hidden laboratory, so leaving his valise in the lighted room he emerged again into the black noisome corridor whose vaulting echoed ceaselessly with that dull and hideous whine.      The next few rooms he tried were all abandoned, or filled only with crumbling boxes and ominous-looking leaden coffins; but impressed him deeply with the magnitude of Joseph Curwens original operations. He thought of the slaves and seamen who had disappeared, of the graves which had been violated in every part of the world, and of what that final raiding party must have seen; and then he decided it was better not to think any more. Once a great stone staircase mounted at his right, and he deduced that this must have reached to one of the Curwen outbuildings - perhaps the famous stone edifice with the high slit-like windows - provided the steps he had descended had led from the steep-roofed farmhouse. Suddenly the walls seemed to fall away ahead, and the stench and the wailing grew stronger. Willett saw that he had come upon a vast open space, so great that his torchlight would not carry across it; and as he advanced he encountered occasional stout pillars supporting the arches of the roof.      After a time he reached a circle of pillars grouped like the monoliths of Stonehenge, with a large carved altar on a base of three steps in the centre; and so curious were the carvings on that altar that he approached to study them with his electric light. But when he saw what they were he shrank away shuddering, and did not stop to investigate the dark stains which discoloured the upper surface and had spread down the sides in occasional thin lines. Instead, he found the distant wall and traced it as it swept round in a gigantic circle perforated by occasional black doorways and indented by a myriad of shallow cells with iron gratings and wrist and ankle bonds on chains fastened to the stone of the concave rear masonry. These cells were empty, but still the horrible odour and the dismal moaning continued, more insistent now than ever, and seemingly varied at times by a sort of slippery thumping.3.      From that frightful smell and that uncanny noise Willetts attention could no longer be diverted. Both were plainer and more hideous in the great pillared hall than anywhere else, and carried a vague impression of being far below, even in this dark nether world of subterrene mystery. Before trying any of the black archways for steps leading further down, the doctor cast his beam of light about the stone-flagged floor. It was very loosely paved, and at irregular intervals there would occur a slab curiously pierced by small holes in no definite arrangement, while at one point there lay a very long ladder carelessly flung down. To this ladder, singularly enough, appeared to cling a particularly large amount of the frightful odour which encompassed everything. As he walked slowly about it suddenly occurred to Willett that both the noise and the odour seemed strongest directly above the oddly pierced slabs, as if they might be crude trap-doors leading down to some still deeper region of horror. Kneeling by one, he worked at it with his hands, and found that with extreme difficulty he could budge it. At his touch the moaning beneath ascended to a louder key, and only with vast trepidation did he persevere in the lifting of the heavy stone. A stench unnamable now rose up from below, and the doctors head reeled dizzily as he laid back the slab and turned his torch upon the exposed square yard of gaping blackness.      If he had expected a flight of steps to some wide gulf of ultimate abomination, Willett was destined to be disappointed; for amidst that foetor and cracked whining he discerned only the brick-faced top of a cylindrical well perhaps a yard and a half in diameter and devoid of any ladder or other means of descent. As the light shone down, the wailing changed suddenly to a series of horrible yelps; in conjunction with which there came again that sound of blind, futile scrambling and slippery thumping. The explorer trembled, unwilling even to imagine what noxious thing might be lurking in that abyss, but in a moment mustered up the courage to peer over the rough-hewn brink; lying at full length and holding the torch downward at arms length to see what might lie below. For a second he could distinguish nothing but the slimy, moss-grown brick walls sinking illimitably into that half-tangible miasma of murk and foulness and anguished frenzy; and then he saw that something dark was leaping clumsily and frantically up and down at the bottom of the narrow shaft, which must have been from twenty to twenty-five feet below the stone floor where he lay. The torch shook in his hand, but he looked again to see what manner of living creature might be immured there in the darkness of that unnatural well; left starving by young Ward through all the long month since the doctors had taken him away, and clearly only one of a vast number prisoned in the kindred wells whose pierced stone covers so thickly studded in the floor of the great vaulted cavern. Whatever the things were, they could not lie down in their cramped spaces; but must have crouched and whined and waited and feebly leaped all those hideous weeks since their master had abandoned them unheeded.      But Marinus Bicknell Willett was sorry that he looked again; for surgeon and veteran of the dissecting-room though he was, he has not been the same since. It is hard to explain just how a single sight of a tangible object with measureable dimensions could so shake and change a man; and we may only say that there is about certain outlines and entities a power of symbolism and suggestion which acts frightfully on a sensitive thinkers perspective and whispers terrible hints of obscure cosmic relationships and unnamable realities behind the protective illusions of common vision. In that second look Willett saw such an outline or entity, for during the next few instants he was undoubtedly as stark mad as any inmate of Dr. Waites private hospital. He dropped the electric torch from a hand drained of muscular power or nervous cordination, nor heeded the sound of crunching teeth which told of its fate at the bottom of the pit. He screamed and screamed and screamed in a voice whose falsetto panic no acquaintance of his would ever have recognised; and though he could not rise to his feet he crawled and rolled desperately away over the damp pavement where dozens of Tartarean wells poured forth their exhausted whining and yelping to answer his own insane cries. He tore his hands on the rough, loose stones, and many times bruised his head against the frequent pillars, but still he kept on. Then at last he slowly came to himself in the utter blackness and stench, and stopped his ears against the droning wail into which the burst of yelping had subsided. He was drenched with perspiration and without means of producing a light; stricken and unnerved in the abysmal blackness and horror, and crushed with a memory he never could efface. Beneath him dozens of those things still lived, and from one of the shafts the cover was removed. He knew that what he had seen could never climb up the slippery walls, yet shuddered at the thought that some obscure foot-hold might exist.      What the thing was, he would never tell. It was like some of the carvings on the hellish altar, but it was alive. Nature had never made it in this form, for it was too palpably unfinished. The deficiencies were of the most surprising sort, and the abnormalities of proportion could not be described. Willett consents only to say that this type of thing must have represented entities which Ward called up from imperfect salts, and which he kept for servile or ritualistic purposes. If it had not had a certain significance, its image would not have been carved on that damnable stone. It was not the worst thing depicted on that stone - but Willett never opened the other pits. At the time, the first connected idea in his mind was an idle paragraph from some of the old Curwen data he had digested long before; a phrase used by Simon or Jedediah Orne in that portentous confiscated letter to the bygone sorcerer: \"Certainely, there was Nothg butt ye liveliest Awfulness in that which H. raisd upp from What he coud gather onlie a part of.\"      Then, horribly supplementing rather than displacing this image, there came a recollection of those ancient lingering rumours anent the burned, twisted thing found in the fields a week after the Curwen raid. Charles Ward had once told the doctor what old Slocum said of that object; that it was neither thoroughly human, nor wholly allied to any animal which Pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about.      These words hummed in the doctors mind as he rocked to and fro, squatting on the nitrous stone floor. He tried to drive them out, and repeated the Lords Prayer to himself; eventually trailing off into a mnemonic hodge-podge like the modernistic Waste Land of Mr. T. S. Eliot and finally reverting to the oft-repeated dual formula he had lately found in Wards underground library: \"Yai ngngah, Yog-Sothoth\", and so on till the final underlined \"Zhro\". It seemed to soothe him, and he staggered to his feet after a time; lamenting bitterly his fright-lost torch and looking wildly about for any gleam of light in the clutching inkiness of the chilly air. Think he would not; but he strained his eyes in every direction for some faint glint or reflection of the bright illumination he had left in the library. After a while he thought he detected a suspicion of a glow infinitely far away, and toward this he crawled in agonised caution on hands and knees amidst the stench and howling, always feeling ahead lest he collide with the numerous great pillars or stumble into the abominable pit he had uncovered.      Once his shaking fingers touched something which he knew must be the steps leading to the hellish altar, and from this spot he recoiled in loathing. At another time he encountered the pierced slab he had removed, and here his caution became almost pitiful. But he did not come upon the dread aperture after all, nor did anything issue from that aperture to detain him. What had been down there made no sound nor stir. Evidently its crunching of the fallen electric torch had not been good for it. Each time Willetts fingers felt a perforated slab he trembled. His passage over it would sometimes increase the groaning below, but generally it would produce no effect at all, since he moved very noiselessly. Several times during his progress the glow ahead diminished perceptibly, and he realised that the various candles and lamps he had left must be expiring one by one. The thought of being lost in utter darkness without matches amidst this underground world of nightmare labyrinths impelled him to rise to his feet and run, which he could safely do now that he had passed the open pit; for he knew that once the light failed, his only hope of rescue and survival would lie in whatever relief party Mr. Ward might send after missing him for a sufficient period. Presently, however, he emerged from the open space into the narrower corridor and definitely located the glow as coming from a door on his right. In a moment he had reached it and was standing once more in young Wards secret library, trembling with relief, and watching the sputterings of that last lamp which had brought him to safety.4.      In another moment he was hastily filling the burned-out lamps from an oil supply he had previously noticed, and when the room was bright again he looked about to see if he might find a lantern for further exploration. For racked though he was with horror, his sense of grim purpose was still uppermost; and he was firmly determined to leave no stone unturned in his search for the hideous facts behind Charles Wards bizarre madness. Failing to find a lantern, he chose the smallest of the lamps to carry; also filling his pockets with candles and matches, and taking with him a gallon can of oil, which he proposed to keep for reserve use in whatever hidden laboratory he might uncover beyond the terrible open space with its unclean altar and nameless covered wells. To traverse that space again would require his utmost fortitude, but he knew it must be done. Fortunately neither the frightful altar nor the opened shaft was near the vast cell-indented wall which bounded the cavern area, and whose black mysterious archways would form the next goals of a logical search.      So Willett went back to that great pillared hall of stench and anguished howling; turning down his lamp to avoid any distant glimpse of the hellish altar, or of the uncovered pit with the pierced stone slab beside it. Most of the black doorways led merely to small chambers, some vacant and some evidently used as storerooms; and in several of the latter he saw some very curious accumulations of various objects. One was packed with rotting and dust-draped bales of spare clothing, and the explorer thrilled when he saw that it was unmistakably the clothing of a century and a half before. In another room he found numerous odds and ends of modern clothing, as if gradual provisions were being made to equip a large body of men. But what he disliked most of all were the huge copper vats which occasionally appeared; these, and the sinister incrustations upon them. He liked them even less than the weirdly figured leaden bowls whose rims retained such obnoxious deposits and around which clung repellent odours perceptible above even the general noisomeness of the crypt. When he had completed about half the entire circuit of the wall he found another corridor like that from which he had come, and out of which many doors opened. This he proceeded to investigate; and after entering three rooms of medium size and of no significant contents, he came at last to a large oblong apartment whose business-like tanks and tables, furnaces and modern instruments, occasional books and endless shelves of jars and bottles proclaimed it indeed the long-sought laboratory of Charles Ward - and no doubt of old Joseph Curwen before him.      After lighting the three lamps which he found filled and ready, Dr. Willett examined the place and all its appurtenances with the keenest interest; noting from the relative quantities of various reagents on the shelves that young Wards dominant concern must have been with some branch of organic chemistry. On the whole, little could be learned from the scientific ensemble, which included a gruesome-looking dissecting table; so that the room was really rather a disappointment. Among the books was a tattered old copy of Borellus in black-letter, and it was weirdly interesting to note that Ward had underlined the same passage whose marking had so perturbed good Mr. Merritt at Curwens farmhouse more than a century and a half before. That older copy, of course, must have perished along with the rest of Curwens occult library in the final raid. Three archways opened off the laboratory, and these the doctor proceeded to sample in turn. From his cursory survey he saw that two led merely to small storerooms; but these he canvassed with care, remarking the piles of coffins in various stages of damage and shuddering violently at two or three of the few coffin-plates he could decipher. There was much clothing also stored in these rooms, and several new and tightly nailed boxes which he did not stop to investigate. Most interesting of all, perhaps, were some odd bits which he judged to be fragments of old Joseph Curwens laboratory appliances. These had suffered damage at the hands of the raiders, but were still partly recognisable as the chemical paraphernalia of the Georgian period.      The third archway led to a very sizeable chamber entirely lined with shelves and having in the centre a table bearing two lamps. These lamps Willett lighted, and in their brilliant glow studied the endless shelving which surrounded him. Some of the upper levels were wholly vacant, but most of the space was filled with small odd-looking leaden jars of two general types; one tall and without handles like a Grecian lekythos or oil-jug, and the other with a single handle and proportioned like a Phaleron jug. All had metal stoppers, and were covered with peculiar-looking symbols moulded in low relief. In a moment the doctor noticed that these jugs were classified with great rigidity; all the lekythoi being on one side of the room with a large wooden sign reading \"Custodes\" above them, and all the Phalerons on the other, correspondingly labelled with a sign reading \"Materia\". Each of the jars or jugs, except some on the upper shelves that turned out to be vacant, bore a cardboard tag with a number apparently referring to a catalogue; and Willett resolved to look for the latter presently. For the moment, however, he was more interested in the nature of the array as a whole; and experimentally opened several of the lekythoi and Phalerons at random with a view to a rough generalisation. The result was invariable. Both types of jar contained a small quantity of a single kind of substance; a fine dusty powder of very light weight and of many shades of dull, neutral colour. To the colours which formed the only point of variation there was no apparent method of disposal; and no distinction between what occurred in the lekythoi and what occurred in the Phalerons. A bluish-grey powder might be by the side of a pinkish-white one, and any one in a Phaleron might have its exact counterpart in a lekythos. The most individual feature about the powders was their non-adhesiveness. Willett would pour one into his hand, and upon returning it to its jug would find that no residue whatever remained on its palm.      The meaning of the two signs puzzled him, and he wondered why this battery of chemicals was separated so radically from those in glass jars on the shelves of the laboratory proper. \"Custodes\", \"Materia\"; that was the Latin for \"Guards\" and \"Materials\", respectively - and then there came a flash of memory as to where he had seen that word \"Guards\" before in connexion with this dreadful mystery. It was, of course, in the recent letter to Dr. Allen purporting to be from old Edward Hutchinson; and the phrase had read: \"There was no Neede to keep the Guards in Shape and eatg off their Heads, and it made Much to be founde in Case of Trouble, as you too welle knowe.\" What did this signify? But wait - was there not still another reference to \"guards\" in this matter which he had failed wholly to recall when reading the Hutchinson letter? Back in the old non-secretive days Ward had told him of the Eleazar Smith diary recording the spying of Smith and Weeden on the Curwen farm, and in that dreadful chronicle there had been a mention of conversations overheard before the old wizard betook himself wholly beneath the earth. There had been, Smith and Weeden insisted, terrible colloquies wherein figured Curwen, certain captives of his, and the guards of those captives. Those guards, according to Hutchinson or his avatar, had eaten their heads off, so that now Dr. Allen did not keep them in shape. And if not in shape, how save as the \"salts\" to which it appears this wizard band was engaged in reducing as many human bodies or skeletons as they could?      So that was what these lekythoi contained; the monstrous fruit of unhallowed rites and deeds, presumably won or cowed to such submission as to help, when called up by some hellish incantation, in the defence of their blasphemous master or the questioning of those who were not so willing? Willett shuddered at the thought of what he had been pouring in and out of his hands, and for a moment felt an impulse to flee in panic from that cavern of hideous shelves with their silent and perhaps watching sentinels. Then he thought of the \"Materia\" - in the myriad Phaleron jugs on the other side of the room. Salts too - and if not the salts of \"guards\", then the salts of what? God! Could it be possible that here lay the mortal relics of half the titan thinkers of all the ages; snatched by supreme ghouls from crypts where the world thought them safe, and subject to the beck and call of madmen who sought to drain their knowledge for some still wilder end whose ultimate effect would concern, as poor Charles had hinted in his frantic note, all civilisation, all natural law, perhaps even the fate of the solar system and the universe? And Marinus Bicknell Willett had sifted their dust through his hands!      Then he noticed a small door at the farther end of the room, and calmed himself enough to approach it and examine the crude sign chiselled above. It was only a symbol, but it filled him with vague spiritual dread; for a morbid, dreaming friend of his had once drawn it on paper and told him a few of the things it means in the dark abyss of sleep. It was the sign of Koth, that dreamers see fixed above the archway of a certain black tower standing alone in twilight - and Willett did not like what his friend Randolph Carter had said of its powers. But a moment later he forgot the sign as he recognised a new acrid odour in the stench-filled air. This was a chemical rather than animal smell, and came clearly from the room beyond the door. And it was, unmistakably, the same odour which had saturated Charles Wards clothing on the day the doctors had taken him away. So it was here that the youth had been interrupted by the final summons? He was wiser than old Joseph Curwen, for he had not resisted. Willett, boldly determined to penetrate every wonder and nightmare this nether realm might contain, seized the small lamp and crossed the threshold. A wave of nameless fright rolled out to meet him, but he yielded to no whim and deferred to no intuition. There was nothing alive here to harm him, and he would not be stayed in his piercing of the eldritch cloud which engulfed his patient.      The room beyond the door was of medium size, and had no furniture save a table, a single chair, and two groups of curious machines with clamps and wheels, which Willett recognised after a moment as mediaeval instruments of torture. On one side of the door stood a rack of savage whips, above which were some shelves bearing empty rows of shallow pedestalled cups of lead shaped like Grecian kylikes. On the other side was the table; with a powerful Argand lamp, a pad and pencil, and two of the stoppered lekythoi from the shelves outside set down at irregular places as if temporarily or in haste. Willett lighted the lamp and looked carefully at the pad, to see what notes young Ward might have been jotting down when interrupted; but found nothing more intelligible than the following disjointed fragments in that crabbed Curwen chirography, which shed no light on the case as a whole:\"B. dyd not. Escapd into walls and founde Place below.\"Saw olde V. saye ye Sabaoth and learnt ye Way.\"Raisd Yog-Sothoth thrice and was ye nexte Day deliverd.\"F. soughte to wipe out all knowg howe to raise Those from Outside.\"      As the strong Argand blaze lit up the entire chamber the doctor saw that the wall opposite the door, between the two groups of torturing appliances in the corners, was covered with pegs from which hung a set of shapeless-looking robes of a rather dismal yellowish-white. But far more interesting were the two vacant walls, both of which were thickly covered with mystic symbols and formulae roughly chiselled in the smooth dressed stone. The damp floor also bore marks of carving; and with but little difficulty Willett deciphered a huge pentagram in the centre, with a plain circle about three feet wide half way between this and each corner. In one of these four circles, near where a yellowish robe had been flung carelessly down, there stood a shallow kylix of the sort found on the shelves above the whip-rack; and just outside the periphery was one of the Phaleron jugs from the shelves in the other room, its tag numbered 118. This was unstoppered, and proved upon inspection to be empty; but the explorer saw with a shiver that the kylix was not. Within its shallow area, and saved from scattering only by the absence of wind in this sequestered cavern, lay a small amount of a dry, dull-greenish efflorescent powder which must have belonged in the jug; and Willett almost reeled at the implications that came sweeping over him as he correlated little by little the several elements and antecedents of the scene. The whips and the instruments of torture, the dust or salts from the jug of \"Materia\", the two lekythoi from the \"Custodes\" shelf, the robes, the formulae on the walls, the notes on the pad, the hints from letters and legends, and the thousand glimpses, doubts, and suppositions which had come to torment the friends and parents of Charles Ward - all these engulfed the doctor in a tidal wave of horror as he looked at that dry greenish powder outspread in the pedestalled leaden kylix on the floor.      With an effort, however, Willett pulled himself together and began studying the formulae chiselled on the walls. From the stained and incrusted letters it was obvious that they were carved in Joseph Curwens time, and their text was such as to be vaguely familiar to one who had read much Curwen material or delved extensively into the history of magic. One the doctor clearly recognised as what Mrs. Ward heard her son chanting on that ominous Good Friday a year before, and what an authority had told him was a very terrible invocation addressed to secret gods outside the normal spheres. It was not spelled here exactly as Mrs. Ward had set it down from memory, nor yet as the authority had shewn it to him in the forbidden pages of \"Eliphas Levi\"; but its identity was unmistakable, and such words as Sabaoth, Metraton, Almousin, and Zariatnatmik sent a shudder of fright through the searcher who had seen and felt so much of cosmic abomination just around the corner.      This was on the left-hand wall as one entered the room. The right-hand wall was no less thickly inscribed, and Willett felt a start of recognition as he came upon the pair of formulae so frequently occurring in the recent notes in the library. They were, roughly speaking, the same; with the ancient symbols of \"Dragons Head\" and \"Dragons Tail\" heading them as in Wards scribblings. But the spelling differed quite widely from that of the modern versions, as if old Curwen had had a different way of recording sound, or as if later study had evolved more powerful and perfected variants of the invocations in question. The doctor tried to reconcile the chiselled version with the one which still ran persistently in his head, and found it hard to do. Where the script he had memorised began \"Yai ngngah, Yog-Sothoth\", this epigraph started out as \"Aye, engengah, Yogge-Sothotha\"; which to his mind would seriously interfere with the syllabification of the second word.      Ground as the later text was into his consciousness, the discrepancy disturbed him; and he found himself chanting the first of the formulae aloud in an effort to square the sound he conceived with the letters he found carved. Weird and menacing in that abyss of antique blasphemy rang his voice; its accents keyed to a droning sing-song either through the spell of the past and the unknown, or through the hellish example of that dull, godless wail from the pits whose inhuman cadences rose and fell rhythmically in the distance through the stench and the darkness.\"YAI NGNGAH,YOG-SOTHOTHHEE - LGEBFAI THRODOGUAAAH!\"      But what was this cold wind which had sprung into life at the very outset of the chant? The lamps were sputtering woefully, and the gloom grew so dense that the letters on the wall nearly faded from sight. There was smoke, too, and an acrid odour which quite drowned out the stench from the far-away wells; an odour like that he had smelt before, yet infinitely stronger and more pungent. He turned from the inscriptions to face the room with its bizarre contents, and saw that the kylix on the floor, in which the ominous efflorescent powder had lain, was giving forth a cloud of thick, greenish-black vapour of surprising volume and opacity. That powder - Great God! it had come from the shelf of \"Materia\" - what was it doing now, and what had started it? The formula he had been chanting - the first of the pair - Dragons Head, ascending node - Blessed Saviour, could it be. . . .      The doctor reeled, and through his head raced wildly disjointed scraps from all he had seen, heard, and read of the frightful case of Joseph Curwen and Charles Dexter Ward. \"I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe. . . . Have ye Wordes for laying at all times readie, and stopp not to be sure when there is any Doubte of Whom you have. . . . Three Talkes with What was therein inhumd. . . .\" Mercy of Heaven, what is that shape behind the parting smoke?5.      Marinus Bicknell Willett has no hope that any part of his tale will be believed except by certain sympathetic friends, hence he has made no attempt to tell it beyond his most intimate circle. Only a few outsiders have ever heard it repeated, and of these the majority laugh and remark that the doctor surely is getting old. He has been advised to take a long vacation and to shun future cases dealing with mental disturbance. But Mr. Ward knows that the veteran physician speaks only a horrible truth. Did not he himself see the noisome aperture in the bungalow cellar? Did not Willett send him home overcome and ill at eleven oclock that portentous morning? Did he not telephone the doctor in vain that evening, and again the next day, and had he not driven to the bungalow itself on that following noon, finding his friend unconscious but unharmed on one of the beds upstairs? Willett had been breathing stertorously, and opened his eyes slowly when Mr. Ward gave him some brandy fetched from the car. Then he shuddered and screamed, crying out, \"That beard . . . those eyes. . . . God, who are you?\" A very strange thing to say to a trim, blue-eyed, clean-shaven gentleman whom he had known from the latters boyhood.      In the bright noon sunlight the bungalow was unchanged since the previous morning. Willetts clothing bore no disarrangement beyond certain smudges and worn places at the knees, and only a faint acrid odour reminded Mr. Ward of what he had smelt on his son that day he was taken to the hospital. The doctors flashlight was missing, but his valise was safely there, as empty as when he had brought it. Before indulging in any explanations, and obviously with great moral effort, Willett staggered dizzily down to the cellar and tried the fateful platform before the tubs. It was unyielding. Crossing to where he had left his yet unused tool satchel the day before, he obtained a chisel and began to pry up the stubborn planks one by one. Underneath the smooth concrete was still visible, but of any opening or perforation there was no longer a trace. Nothing yawned this time to sicken the mystified father who had followed the doctor downstairs; only the smooth concrete underneath the planks - no noisome well, no world of subterrene horrors, no secret library, no Curwen papers, no nightmare pits of stench and howling, no laboratory or shelves or chiselled formulae, no. . . . Dr. Willett turned pale, and clutched at the younger man. \"Yesterday,\" he asked softly, \"did you see it here . . . and smell it?\" And when Mr. Ward, himself transfixed with dread and wonder, found strength to nod an affirmative, the physician gave a sound half a sigh and half a gasp, and nodded in turn. \"Then I will tell you,\" he said.      So for an hour, in the sunniest room they could find upstairs, the physician whispered his frightful tale to the wondering father. There was nothing to relate beyond the looming up of that form when the greenish-black vapour from the kylix parted, and Willett was too tired to ask himself what had really occurred. There were futile, bewildered head-shakings from both men, and once Mr. Ward ventured a hushed suggestion, \"Do you suppose it would be of any use to dig?\" The doctor was silent, for it seemed hardly fitting for any human brain to answer when powers of unknown spheres had so vitally encroached on this side of the Great Abyss. Again Mr. Ward asked, \"But where did it go? It brought you here, you know, and it sealed up the hole somehow.\" And Willett again let silence answer for him.      But after all, this was not the final phase of the matter. Reaching for his handkerchief before rising to leave, Dr. Willetts fingers closed upon a piece of paper in his pocket which had not been there before, and which was companioned by the candles and matches he had seized in the vanished vault. It was a common sheet, torn obviously from the cheap pad in that fabulous room of horror somewhere underground, and the writing upon it was that of an ordinary lead pencil - doubtless the one which had lain beside the pad. It was folded very carelessly, and beyond the faint acrid scent of the cryptic chamber bore no print or mark of any world but this. But in the text itself it did indeed reek with wonder; for here was no script of any wholesome age, but the laboured strokes of mediaeval darkness, scarcely legible to the laymen who now strained over it, yet having combinations of symbols which seemed vaguely familiar. The briefly scrawled message was this, and its mystery lent purpose to the shaken pair, who forthwith walked steadily out to the Ward car and gave orders to be driven first to a quiet dining place and then to the John Hay Library on the hill.      At the library it was easy to find good manuals of palaeography, and over these the two men puzzled till the lights of evening shone out from the great chandelier. In the end they found what was needed. The letters were indeed no fantastic invention, but the normal script of a very dark period. They were the pointed Saxon minuscules of the eighth or ninth century A.D., and brought with them memories of an uncouth time when under a fresh Christian veneer ancient faiths and ancient rites stirred stealthily, and the pale moon of Britain looked sometimes on strange deeds in the Roman ruins of Caerleon and Hexham, and by the towers along Hadrians crumbling wall. The words were in such Latin as a barbarous age might remember - \"Corvinus necandus est. Cadaver aq(ua) forti dissolvendum, nec aliq(ui)d retinendum. Tace ut potes.\" - which may roughly be translated, \"Curwen must be killed. The body must be dissolved in aqua fortis, nor must anything be retained. Keep silence as best you are able.\"      Willett and Mr. Ward were mute and baffled. They had met the unknown, and found that they lacked emotions to respond to it as they vaguely believed they ought. With Willett, especially, the capacity for receiving fresh impressions of awe was well-nigh exhausted; and both men sat still and helpless till the closing of the library forced them to leave. Then they drove listlessly to the Ward mansion in Prospect Street, and talked to no purpose into the night. The doctor rested toward morning, but did not go home. And he was still there Sunday noon when a telephone message came from the detectives who had been assigned to look up Dr. Allen.      Mr. Ward, who was pacing nervously about in a dressing-gown, answered the call in person; and told the men to come up early the next day when he heard their report was almost ready. Both Willett and he were glad that this phase of the matter was taking form, for whatever the origin of the strange minuscule message, it seemed certain that the \"Curwen\" who must be destroyed could be no other than the bearded and spectacled stranger. Charles had feared this man, and had said in the frantic note that he must be killed and dissolved in acid. Allen, moreover, had been receiving letters from the strange wizards in Europe under the name of Curwen, and palpably regarded himself as an avatar of the bygone necromancer. And now from a fresh and unknown source had come a message saying that \"Curwen\" must be killed and dissolved in acid. The linkage was too unmistakable to be factitious; and besides, was not Allen planning to murder young Ward upon the advice of the creature called Hutchinson? Of course, the letter they had seen had never reached the bearded stranger; but from its text they could see that Allen had already formed plans for dealing with the youth if he grew too squeamish. Without doubt, Allen must be apprehended; and even if the most drastic directions were not carried out, he must be placed where he could inflict no harm upon Charles Ward.      That afternoon, hoping against hope to extract some gleam of information anent the inmost mysteries from the only available one capable of giving it, the father and the doctor went down the bay and called on young Charles at the hospital. Simply and gravely Willett told him all he had found, and noticed how pale he turned as each description made certain the truth of the discovery. The physician employed as much dramatic effect as he could, and watched for a wincing on Charless part when he approached the matter of the covered pits and the nameless hybrids within. But Ward did not wince. Willett paused, and his voice grew indignant as he spoke of how the things were starving. He taxed the youth with shocking inhumanity, and shivered when only a sardonic laugh came in reply. For Charles, having dropped as useless his pretence that the crypt did not exist, seemed to see some ghastly jest in this affair; and chuckled hoarsely at something which amused him. Then he whispered, in accents doubly terrible because of the cracked voice he used, \"Damn em, they do eat, but they dont need to! Thats the rare part! A month, you say, without food? Lud, Sir, you be modest! Dye know, that was the joke on poor old Whipple with his virtuous bluster! Kill everything off, would he? Why, damme, he was half-deaf with the noise from Outside and never saw or heard aught from the wells! He never dreamed they were there at all! Devil take ye, those cursed things have been howling down there ever since Curwen was done for a hundred and fifty-seven years gone!\"      But no more than this could Willett get from the youth. Horrified, yet almost convinced against his will, he went on with his tale in the hope that some incident might startle his auditor out of the mad composure he maintained. Looking at the youths face, the doctor could not but feel a kind of terror at the changes which recent months had wrought. Truly, the boy had drawn down nameless horrors from the skies. When the room with the formulae and the greenish dust was mentioned, Charles shewed his first sign of animation. A quizzical look overspread his face as he heard what Willett had read on the pad, and he ventured the mild statement that those notes were old ones, of no possible significance to anyone not deeply initiated in the history of magic. \"But,\" he added, \"had you but known the words to bring up that which I had out in the cup, you had not been here to tell me this. Twas Number 118, and I conceive you would have shook had you looked it up in my list in tother room. Twas never raised by me, but I meant to have it up that day you came to invite me hither.\"      Then Willett told of the formula he had spoken and of the greenish-black smoke which had arisen; and as he did so he saw true fear dawn for the first time on Charles Wards face. \"It came, and you be here alive?\" As Ward croaked the words his voice seemed almost to burst free of its trammels and sink to cavernous abysses of uncanny resonance. Willett, gifted with a flash of inspiration, believed he saw the situation, and wove into his reply a caution from a letter he remembered. \"No. 118, you say? But dont forget that stones are all changed now in nine grounds out of ten. You are never sure till you question!\" And then, without warning, he drew forth the minuscule message and flashed it before the patients eyes. He could have wished no stronger result, for Charles Ward fainted forthwith.      All this conversation, of course, had been conducted with the greatest secrecy lest the resident alienists accuse the father and the physician of encouraging a madman in his delusions. Unaided, too, Dr. Willett and Mr. Ward picked up the stricken youth and placed him on the couch. In reviving, the patient mumbled many times of some word which he must get to Orne and Hutchinson at once; so when his consciousness seemed fully back the doctor told him that of those strange creatures at least one was his bitter enemy, and had given Dr. Allen advice for his assassination. This revelation produced no visible effect, and before it was made the visitors could see that their host had already the look of a hunted man. After that he would converse no more, so Willett and the father departed presently; leaving behind a caution against the bearded Allen, to which the youth only replied that this individual was very safely taken care of, and could do no one any harm even if he wished. This was said with an almost evil chuckle very painful to hear. They did not worry about any communications Charles might indite to that monstrous pair in Europe, since they knew that the hospital authorities seized all outgoing mail for censorship and would pass no wild or outr-looking missive.      There is, however, a curious sequel to the matter of Orne and Hutchinson, if such indeed the exiled wizards were. Moved by some vague presentiment amidst the horrors of that period, Willett arranged with an international press-cutting bureau for accounts of notable current crimes and accidents in Prague and in eastern Transylvania; and after six months believed that he had found two very significant things amongst the multifarious items he received and had translated. One was the total wrecking of a house by night in the oldest quarter of Prague, and the disappearance of the evil old man called Josef Nadek, who had dwelt in it alone ever since anyone could remember. The other was a titan explosion in the Transylvanian mountains east of Rakus, and the utter extirpation with all its inmates of the ill-regarded Castle Ferenczy, whose master was so badly spoken of by peasants and soldiery alike that he would shortly have been summoned to Bucharest for serious questioning had not this incident cut off a career already so long as to antedate all common memory. Willett maintains that the hand which wrote those minuscules was able to wield stronger weapons as well; and that while Curwen was left to him to dispose of, the writer felt able to find and deal with Orne and Hutchinson itself. Of what their fate may have been the doctor strives sedulously not to think.6.      The following morning Dr. Willett hastened to the Ward home to be present when the detectives arrived. Allens destruction or imprisonment - or Curwens, if one might regard the tacit claim to reincarnation as valid - he felt must be accomplished at any cost, and he communicated this conviction to Mr. Ward as they sat waiting for the men to come. They were downstairs this time, for the upper parts of the house were beginning to be shunned because of a peculiar nauseousness which hung indefinitely about; a nauseousness which the older servants connected with some curse left by the vanished Curwen portrait.      At nine oclock the three detectives presented themselves and immediately delivered all that they had to say. They had not, regrettably enough, located the Brava Tony Gomes as they had wished, nor had they found the least trace of Dr. Allens source or present whereabouts; but they had managed to unearth a considerable number of local impressions and facts concerning the reticent stranger. Allen had struck Pawtuxet people as a vaguely unnatural being, and there was an universal belief that his thick sandy beard was either dyed or false - a belief conclusively upheld by the finding of such a false beard, together with a pair of dark glasses, in his room at the fateful bungalow. His voice, Mr. Ward could well testify from his one telephone conversation, had a depth and hollowness that could not be forgotten; and his glance seemed malign even through his smoked and horn-rimmed glasses. One shopkeeper, in the course of negotiations, had seen a specimen of his handwriting and declared it was very queer and crabbed; this being confirmed by pencilled notes of no clear meaning found in his room and identified by the merchant. In connexion with the vampirism rumours of the preceding summer, a majority of the gossips believed that Allen rather than Ward was the actual vampire. Statements were also obtained from the officials who had visited the bungalow after the unpleasant incident of the motor truck robbery. They had felt less of the sinister in Dr. Allen, but had recognised him as the dominant figure in the queer shadowy cottage. The place had been too dark for them to observe him clearly, but they would know him again if they saw him. His beard had looked odd, and they thought he had some slight scar above his dark spectacled right eye. As for the detectives search of Allens room, it yielded nothing definite save the beard and glasses, and several pencilled notes in a crabbed writing which Willett at once saw was identical with that shared by the old Curwen manuscripts and by the voluminous recent notes of young Ward found in the vanished catacombs of horror.      Dr. Willett and Mr. Ward caught something of a profound, subtle, and insidious cosmic fear from this data as it was gradually unfolded, and almost trembled in following up the vague, mad thought which had simultaneously reached their minds. The false beard and glasses - the crabbed Curwen penmanship - the old portrait and its tiny scar - and the altered youth in the hospital with such a scar - that deep, hollow voice on the telephone - was it not of this that Mr. Ward was reminded when his son barked forth those pitiable tones to which he now claimed to be reduced? Who had ever seen Charles and Allen together? Yes, the officials had once, but who later on? Was it not when Allen left that Charles suddenly lost his growing fright and began to live wholly at the bungalow? Curwen - Allen - Ward - in what blasphemous and abominable fusion had two ages and two persons become involved? That damnable resemblance of the picture to Charles - had it not used to stare and stare, and follow the boy around the room with its eyes? Why, too, did both Allen and Charles copy Joseph Curwens handwriting, even when alone and off guard? And then the frightful work of those people - the lost crypt of horrors that had aged the doctor overnight; the starved monsters in the noisome pits; the awful formula which had yielded such nameless results; the message in minuscules found in Willetts pocket; the papers and the letters and all the talk of graves and \"salts\" and discoveries - whither did everything lead? In the end Mr. Ward did the most sensible thing. Steeling himself against any realisation of why he did it, he gave the detectives an article to be shewn to such Pawtuxet shopkeepers as had seen the portentous Dr. Allen. That article was a photograph of his luckless son, on which he now carefully drew in ink the pair of heavy glasses and the black pointed beard which the men had brought from Allens room.      For two hours he waited with the doctor in the oppressive house where fear and miasma were slowly gathering as the empty panel in the upstairs library leered and leered and leered. Then the men returned. Yes. The altered photograph was a very passable likeness of Dr. Allen. Mr. Ward turned pale, and Willett wiped a suddenly dampened brow with his handkerchief. Allen - Ward - Curwen - it was becoming too hideous for coherent thought. What had the boy called out of the void, and what had it done to him? What, really, had happened from first to last? Who was this Allen who sought to kill Charles as too squeamish, and why had his destined victim said in the postscript to that frantic letter that he must be so completely obliterated in acid? Why, too, had the minuscule message, of whose origin no one dared think, said that \"Curwen\" must be likewise obliterated? What was the change, and when had the final stage occurred? That day when his frantic note was received - he had been nervous all the morning, then there was an alteration. He had slipped out unseen and swaggered boldly in past the men hired to guard him. That was the time, when he was out. But no - had he not cried out in terror as he entered his study - this very room? What had he found there? Or wait - what had found him? That simulacrum which brushed boldly in without having been seen to go - was that an alien shadow and a horror forcing itself upon a trembling figure which had never gone out at all? Had not the butler spoken of queer noises?      Willett rang for the man and asked him some low-toned questions. It had, surely enough, been a bad business. There had been noises - a cry, a gasp, a choking, and a sort of clattering or creaking or thumping, or all of these. And Mr. Charles was not the same when he stalked out without a word. The butler shivered as he spoke, and sniffed at the heavy air that blew down from some open window upstairs. Terror had settled definitely upon the house, and only the business-like detectives failed to imbibe a full measure of it. Even they were restless, for this case had held vague elements in the background which pleased them not at all. Dr. Willett was thinking deeply and rapidly, and his thoughts were terrible ones. Now and then he would almost break into muttering as he ran over in his head a new, appalling, and increasingly conclusive chain of nightmare happenings.      Then Mr. Ward made a sign that the conference was over, and everyone save him and the doctor left the room. It was noon now, but shadows as of coming night seemed to engulf the phantom-haunted mansion. Willett began talking very seriously to his host, and urged that he leave a great deal of the future investigation to him. There would be, he predicted, certain obnoxious elements which a friend could bear better than a relative. As family physician he must have a free hand, and the first thing he required was a period alone and undisturbed in the abandoned library upstairs, where the ancient overmantel had gathered about itself an aura of noisome horror more intense than when Joseph Curwens features themselves glanced slyly down from the painted panel.      Mr. Ward, dazed by the flood of grotesque morbidities and unthinkably maddening suggestions that poured in upon him from every side, could only acquiesce; and half an hour later the doctor was locked in the shunned room with the panelling from Olney Court. The father, listening outside, heard fumbling sounds of moving and rummaging as the moments passed; and finally a wrench and a creak, as if a tight cupboard door were being opened. Then there was a muffled cry, a kind of snorting choke, and a hasty slamming of whatever had been opened. Almost at once the key rattled and Willett appeared in the hall, haggard and ghastly, and demanding wood for the real fireplace on the south wall of the room. The furnace was not enough, he said; and the electric log had little practical use. Longing yet not daring to ask questions, Mr. Ward gave the requisite orders and a man brought some stout pine logs, shuddering as he entered the tainted air of the library to place them in the grate. Willett meanwhile had gone up to the dismantled laboratory and brought down a few odds and ends not included in the moving of the July before. They were in a covered basket, and Mr. Ward never saw what they were.      Then the doctor locked himself in the library once more, and by the clouds of smoke which rolled down past the windows from the chimney it was known that he had lighted the fire. Later, after a great rustling of newspapers, that odd wrench and creaking were heard again; followed by a thumping which none of the eavesdroppers liked. Thereafter two suppressed cries of Willetts were heard, and hard upon these came a swishing rustle of indefinable hatefulness. Finally the smoke that the wind beat down from the chimney grew very dark and acrid, and everyone wished that the weather had spared them this choking and venomous inundation of peculiar fumes. Mr. Wards head reeled, and the servants all clustered together in a knot to watch the horrible black smoke swoop down. After an age of waiting the vapours seemed to lighten, and half-formless sounds of scraping, sweeping, and other minor operations were heard behind the bolted door. And at last, after the slamming of some cupboard within, Willett made his appearance - sad, pale, and haggard, and bearing the cloth-draped basket he had taken from the upstairs laboratory. He had left the window open, and into that once accursed room was pouring a wealth of pure, wholesome air to mix with a queer new smell of disinfectants. The ancient overmantel still lingered; but it seemed robbed of malignity now, and rose as calm and stately in its white panelling as if it had never borne the picture of Joseph Curwen. Night was coming on, yet this time its shadows held no latent fright, but only a gentle melancholy. Of what he had done the doctor would never speak. To Mr. Ward he said, \"I can answer no questions, but I will say that there are different kinds of magic. I have made a great purgation, and those in this house will sleep the better for it.\"7.      That Dr. Willetts \"purgation\" had been an ordeal almost as nerve-racking in its way as his hideous wandering in the vanished crypt is shewn by the fact that the elderly physician gave out completely as soon as he reached home that evening. For three days he rested constantly in his room, though servants later muttered something about having heard him after midnight on Wednesday, when the outer door softly opened and closed with phenomenal softness. Servants imaginations, fortunately, are limited, else comment might have been excited by an item in Thursdays Evening Bulletin which ran as follows:North End GhoulsActive AgainAfter a lull of ten months since the dastardly vandalism in the Weeden lot at the North Burial Ground, a nocturnal prowler was glimpsed early this morning in the same cemetery by Robert Hart, the night watchman. Happening to glance for a moment from his shelter at about 2 a.m., Hart observed the glow of a lantern or pocket torch not far to the northwest, and upon opening the door detected the figure of a man with a trowel very plainly silhouetted against a nearby electric light. At once starting in pursuit, he saw the figure dart hurriedly toward the main entrance, gaining the street and losing himself among the shadows before approach or capture was possible.      Like the first of the ghouls active during the past year, this intruder had done no real damage before detection. A vacant part of the Ward lot shewed signs of a little superficial digging, but nothing even nearly the size of a grave had been attempted, and no previous grave had been disturbed.      Hart, who cannot describe the prowler except as a small man probably having a full beard, inclines to the view that all three of the digging incidents have a common source; but police from the Second Station think otherwise on account of the savage nature of the second incident, where an ancient coffin was removed and its headstone violently shattered.      The first of the incidents, in which it is thought an attempt to bury something was frustrated, occurred a year ago last March, and has been attributed to bootleggers seeking a cache. It is possible, says Sergt. Riley, that this third affair is of similar nature. Officers at the Second Station are taking especial pains to capture the gang of miscreants responsible for these repeated outrages.      All day Thursday Dr. Willett rested as if recuperating from something past or nerving himself for something to come. In the evening he wrote a note to Mr. Ward, which was delivered the next morning and which caused the half-dazed parent to ponder long and deeply. Mr. Ward had not been able to go down to business since the shock of Monday with its baffling reports and its sinister \"purgation\", but he found something calming about the doctors letter in spite of the despair it seemed to promise and the fresh mysteries it seemed to evoke.\"10 Barnes St.,            Providence, R.I.,      April 12, 1928.\"Dear Theodore: - I feel that I must say a word to you before doing what I am going to do tomorrow. It will conclude the terrible business we have been going through (for I feel that no spade is ever likely to reach that monstrous place we know of), but Im afraid it wont set your mind at rest unless I expressly assure you how very conclusive it is.      \"You have known me ever since you were a small boy, so I think you will not distrust me when I hint that some matters are best left undecided and unexplored. It is better that you attempt no further speculation as to Charless case, and almost imperative that you tell his mother nothing more than she already suspects. When I call on you tomorrow Charles will have escaped. That is all which need remain in anyones mind. He was mad, and he escaped. You can tell his mother gently and gradually about the mad part when you stop sending the typed notes in his name. Id advise you to join her in Atlantic City and take a rest yourself. God knows you need one after this shock, as I do myself. I am going South for a while to calm down and brace up.      \"So dont ask me any questions when I call. It may be that something will go wrong, but Ill tell you if it does. I dont think it will. There will be nothing more to worry about, for Charles will be very, very safe. He is now - safer than you dream. You need hold no fears about Allen, and who or what he is. He forms as much a part of the past as Joseph Curwens picture, and when I ring your doorbell you may feel certain that there is no such person. And what wrote that minuscule message will never trouble you or yours.      \"But you must steel yourself to melancholy, and prepare your wife to do the same. I must tell you frankly that Charless escape will not mean his restoration to you. He has been afflicted with a peculiar disease, as you must realise from the subtle physical as well as mental changes in him, and you must not hope to see him again. Have only this consolation - that he was never a fiend or even truly a madman, but only an eager, studious, and curious boy whose love of mystery and of the past was his undoing. He stumbled on things no mortal ought ever to know, and reached back through the years as no one ever should reach; and something came out of those years to engulf him.      \"And now comes the matter in which I must ask you to trust me most of all. For there will be, indeed, no uncertainty about Charless fate. In about a year, say, you can if you wish devise a suitable account of the end; for the boy will be no more. You can put up a stone in your lot at the North Burial Ground exactly ten feet west of your fathers and facing the same way, and that will mark the true resting-place of your son. Nor need you fear that it will mark any abnormality or changeling. The ashes in that grave will be those of your own unaltered bone and sinew - of the real Charles Dexter Ward whose mind you watched from infancy - the real Charles with the olive-mark on his hip and without the black witch-mark on his chest or the pit on his forehead. The Charles who never did actual evil, and who will have paid with his life for his squeamishness.      \"That is all. Charles will have escaped, and a year from now you can put up his stone. Do not question me tomorrow. And believe that the honour of your ancient family remains untainted now, as it has been at all times in the past.      \"With profoundest sympathy, and exhortations to fortitude, calmness, and resignation, I am everSincerely your friend,      Marinus B. Willett\"      So on the morning of Friday, April 13, 1928, Marinus Bicknell Willett visited the room of Charles Dexter Ward at Dr. Waites private hospital on Conanicut Island. The youth, though making no attempt to evade his caller, was in a sullen mood; and seemed disinclined to open the conversation which Willett obviously desired. The doctors discovery of the crypt and his monstrous experience therein had of course created a new source of embarrassment, so that both hesitated perceptibly after the interchange of a few strained formalities. Then a new element of constraint crept in, as Ward seemed to read behind the doctors mask-like face a terrible purpose which had never been there before. The patient quailed, conscious that since the last visit there had been a change whereby the solicitous family physician had given place to the ruthless and implacable avenger.      Ward actually turned pale, and the doctor was the first to speak. \"More,\" he said, \"has been found out, and I must warn you fairly that a reckoning is due.\"      \"Digging again, and coming upon more poor starving pets?\" was the ironic reply. It was evident that the youth meant to shew bravado to the last.      \"No,\" Willett slowly rejoined, \"this time I did not have to dig. We have had men looking up Dr. Allen, and they found the false beard and spectacles in the bungalow.\"      \"Excellent,\" commented the disquieted host in an effort to be wittily insulting, \"and I trust they proved more becoming than the beard and glasses you now have on!\"      \"They would become you very well,\" came the even and studied response, \"as indeed they seem to have done.\"      As Willett said this, it almost seemed as though a cloud passed over the sun; though there was no change in the shadows on the floor. Then Ward ventured:      \"And is this what asks so hotly for a reckoning? Suppose a man does find it now and then useful to be twofold?\"      \"No,\" said Willett gravely, \"again you are wrong. It is no business of mine if any man seeks duality; provided he has any right to exist at all, and provided he does not destroy what called him out of space.\"      Ward now started violently. \"Well, Sir, what have ye found, and what dye want with me?\"      The doctor let a little time elapse before replying, as if choosing his words for an effective answer.      \"I have found,\" he finally intoned, \"something in a cupboard behind an ancient overmantel where a picture once was, and I have burned it and buried the ashes where the grave of Charles Dexter Ward ought to be.\"      The madman choked and sprang from the chair in which he had been sitting:      \"Damn ye, who did ye tell - and wholl believe it was he after these full two months, with me alive? What dye mean to do?\"      Willett, though a small man, actually took on a kind of judicial majesty as he calmed the patient with a gesture.      \"I have told no one. This is no common case - it is a madness out of time and a horror from beyond the spheres which no police or lawyers or courts or alienists could ever fathom or grapple with. Thank God some chance has left inside me the spark of imagination, that I might not go astray in thinking out this thing. You cannot deceive me, Joseph Curwen, for I know that your accursed magic is true!      \"I know how you wove the spell that brooded outside the years and fastened on your double and descendant; I know how you drew him into the past and got him to raise you up from your detestable grave; I know how he kept you hidden in his laboratory while you studied modern things and roved abroad as a vampire by night, and how you later shewed yourself in beard and glasses that no one might wonder at your godless likeness to him; I know what you resolved to do when he balked at your monstrous rifling of the worlds tombs, and at what you planned afterward, and I know how you did it.      \"You left off your beard and glasses and fooled the guards around the house. They thought it was he who went in, and they thought it was he who came out when you had strangled and hidden him. But you hadnt reckoned on the different contents of two minds. You were a fool, Curwen, to fancy that a mere visual identity would be enough. Why didnt you think of the speech and the voice and the handwriting? It hasnt worked, you see, after all. You know better than I who or what wrote that message in minuscules, but I will warn you it was not written in vain. There are abominations and blasphemies which must be stamped out, and I believe that the writer of those words will attend to Orne and Hutchinson. One of those creatures wrote you once, do not call up any that you can not put down. You were undone once before, perhaps in that very way, and it may be that your own evil magic will undo you all again. Curwen, a man cant tamper with Nature beyond certain limits, and every horror you have woven will rise up to wipe you out.\"      But here the doctor was cut short by a convulsive cry from the creature before him. Hopelessly at bay, weaponless, and knowing that any show of physical violence would bring a score of attendants to the doctors rescue, Joseph Curwen had recourse to his one ancient ally, and began a series of cabbalistic motions with his forefingers as his deep, hollow voice, now unconcealed by feigned hoarseness, bellowed out the opening words of a terrible formula.      \"PER ADONAI ELOIM, ADONAI JEHOVA, ADONAI SABAOTH, METRATON. . . .\"      But Willett was too quick for him. Even as the dogs in the yard outside began to howl, and even as a chill wind sprang suddenly up from the bay, the doctor commenced the solemn and measured intonation of that which he had meant all along to recite. An eye for an eye - magic for magic - let the outcome shew how well the lesson of the abyss had been learned! So in a clear voice Marinus Bicknell Willett began the second of that pair of formulae whose first had raised the writer of those minuscules - the cryptic invocation whose heading was the Dragons Tail, sign of the descending node - \"OGTHROD AIFGEBL - EEHYOG-SOTHOTHNGAHNG AIYZHRO!\"      At the very first word from Willetts mouth the previously commenced formula of the patient stopped short. Unable to speak, the monster made wild motions with his arms until they too were arrested. When the awful name of Yog-Sothoth was uttered, the hideous change began. It was not merely a dissolution, but rather a transformation or recapitulation; and Willett shut his eyes lest he faint before the rest of the incantation could be pronounced.      But he did not faint, and that man of unholy centuries and forbidden secrets never troubled the world again. The madness out of time had subsided, and the case of Charles Dexter Ward was closed. Opening his eyes before staggering out of that room of horror, Dr. Willett saw that what he had kept in memory had not been kept amiss. There had, as he had predicted, been no need for acids. For like his accursed picture a year before, Joseph Curwen now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust.", "II.It was in the township of Dunwich, in a large and partly inhabited farmhouse set against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile and a half from any other dwelling, that Wilbur Whateley was born at 5 A.M. on Sunday, the second of February, 1913. This date was recalled because it was Candlemas, which people in Dunwich curiously observe under another name; and because the noises in the hills had sounded, and all the dogs of the countryside had barked persistently, throughout the night before. Less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother was one of the decadent Whateleys, a somewhat deformed, unattractive albino woman of thirty-five, living with an aged and half-insane father about whom the most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered in his youth. Lavinia Whateley had no known husband, but according to the custom of the region made no attempt to disavow the child; concerning the other side of whose ancestry the country folk might—and did—speculate as widely as they chose. On the contrary, she seemed strangely proud of the dark, goatish-looking infant who formed such a contrast to her own sickly and pink-eyed albinism, and was heard to mutter many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous future.      Lavinia was one who would be apt to mutter such things, for she was a lone creature given to wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and trying to read the great odorous books which her father had inherited through two centuries of Whateleys, and which were fast falling to pieces with age and worm-holes. She had never been to school, but was filled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore that Old Whateley had taught her. The remote farmhouse had always been feared because of Old Whateley’s reputation for black magic, and the unexplained death by violence of Mrs. Whateley when Lavinia was twelve years old had not helped to make the place popular. Isolated among strange influences, Lavinia was fond of wild and grandiose day-dreams and singular occupations; nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares in a home from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since disappeared.      There was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises and the dogs’ barking on the night Wilbur was born, but no known doctor or midwife presided at his coming. Neighbours knew nothing of him till a week afterward, when Old Whateley drove his sleigh through the snow into Dunwich Village and discoursed incoherently to the group of loungers at Osborn’s general store. There seemed to be a change in the old man—an added element of furtiveness in the clouded brain which subtly transformed him from an object to a subject of fear—though he was not one to be perturbed by any common family event. Amidst it all he shewed some trace of the pride later noticed in his daughter, and what he said of the child’s paternity was remembered by many of his hearers years afterward.      “I dun’t keer what folks think—ef Lavinny’s boy looked like his pa, he wouldn’t look like nothin’ ye expeck. Ye needn’t think the only folks is the folks hereabaouts. Lavinny’s read some, an’ has seed some things the most o’ ye only tell abaout. I calc’late her man is as good a husban’ as ye kin find this side of Aylesbury; an’ ef ye knowed as much abaout the hills as I dew, ye wouldn’t ast no better church weddin’ nor her’n. Let me tell ye suthin’—some day yew folks’ll hear a child o’ Lavinny’s a-callin’ its father’s name on the top o’ Sentinel Hill!”      The only persons who saw Wilbur during the first month of his life were old Zechariah Whateley, of the undecayed Whateleys, and Earl Sawyer’s common-law wife, Mamie Bishop. Mamie’s visit was frankly one of curiosity, and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations; but Zechariah came to lead a pair of Alderney cows which Old Whateley had bought of his son Curtis. This marked the beginning of a course of cattle-buying on the part of small Wilbur’s family which ended only in 1928, when the Dunwich horror came and went; yet at no time did the ramshackle Whateley barn seem overcrowded with livestock. There came a period when people were curious enough to steal up and count the herd that grazed precariously on the steep hillside above the old farmhouse, and they could never find more than ten or twelve anaemic, bloodless-looking specimens. Evidently some blight or distemper, perhaps sprung from the unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi and timbers of the filthy barn, caused a heavy mortality amongst the Whateley animals. Odd wounds or sores, having something of the aspect of incisions, seemed to afflict the visible cattle; and once or twice during the earlier months certain callers fancied they could discern similar sores about the throats of the grey, unshaven old man and his slatternly, crinkly-haired albino daughter.      In the spring after Wilbur’s birth Lavinia resumed her customary rambles in the hills, bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy child. Public interest in the Whateleys subsided after most of the country folk had seen the baby, and no one bothered to comment on the swift development which that newcomer seemed every day to exhibit. Wilbur’s growth was indeed phenomenal, for within three months of his birth he had attained a size and muscular power not usually found in infants under a full year of age. His motions and even his vocal sounds shewed a restraint and deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant, and no one was really unprepared when, at seven months, he began to walk unassisted, with falterings which another month was sufficient to remove.      It was somewhat after this time—on Hallowe’en—that a great blaze was seen at midnight on the top of Sentinel Hill where the old table-like stone stands amidst its tumulus of ancient bones. Considerable talk was started when Silas Bishop—of the undecayed Bishops—mentioned having seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother about an hour before the blaze was remarked. Silas was rounding up a stray heifer, but he nearly forgot his mission when he fleetingly spied the two figures in the dim light of his lantern. They darted almost noiselessly through the underbrush, and the astonished watcher seemed to think they were entirely unclothed. Afterward he could not be sure about the boy, who may have had some kind of a fringed belt and a pair of dark trunks or trousers on. Wilbur was never subsequently seen alive and conscious without complete and tightly buttoned attire, the disarrangement or threatened disarrangement of which always seemed to fill him with anger and alarm. His contrast with his squalid mother and grandfather in this respect was thought very notable until the horror of 1928 suggested the most valid of reasons.      The next January gossips were mildly interested in the fact that “Lavinny’s black brat” had commenced to talk, and at the age of only eleven months. His speech was somewhat remarkable both because of its difference from the ordinary accents of the region, and because it displayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of three or four might well be proud. The boy was not talkative, yet when he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpossessed by Dunwich and its denizens. The strangeness did not reside in what he said, or even in the simple idioms he used; but seemed vaguely linked with his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the spoken sounds. His facial aspect, too, was remarkable for its maturity; for though he shared his mother’s and grandfather’s chinlessness, his firm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression of his large, dark, almost Latin eyes to give him an air of quasi-adulthood and well-nigh preternatural intelligence. He was, however, exceedingly ugly despite his appearance of brilliancy; there being something almost goatish or animalistic about his thick lips, large-pored, yellowish skin, coarse crinkly hair, and oddly elongated ears. He was soon disliked even more decidedly than his mother and grandsire, and all conjectures about him were spiced with references to the bygone magic of Old Whateley, and how the hills once shook when he shrieked the dreadful name of Yog-Sothoth in the midst of a circle of stones with a great book open in his arms before him. Dogs abhorred the boy, and he was always obliged to take various defensive measures against their barking menace."]}
{"id": "EN051", "pair": ["V. A Nightmare and a Cataclysm1.And now swiftly followed that hideous experience which has left its indelible mark of fear on the soul of Marinus Bicknell Willett, and has added a decade to the visible age of one whose youth was even then far behind. Dr. Willett had conferred at length with Mr. Ward, and had come to an agreement with him on several points which both felt the alienists would ridicule. There was, they conceded, a terrible movement alive in the world, whose direct connexion with a necromancy even older than the Salem witchcraft could not be doubted. That at least two living men - and one other of whom they dared not think - were in absolute possession of minds or personalities which had functioned as early as 1690 or before was likewise almost unassailably proved even in the face of all known natural laws. What these horrible creatures - and Charles Ward as well - were doing or trying to do seemed fairly clear from their letters and from every bit of light both old and new which had filtered in upon the case. They were robbing the tombs of all the ages, including those of the worlds wisest and greatest men, in the hope of recovering from the bygone ashes some vestige of the consciousness and lore which had once animated and informed them.      A hideous traffick was going on among these nightmare ghouls, whereby illustrious bones were bartered with the calm calculativeness of schoolboys swapping books; and from what was extorted from this centuried dust there was anticipated a power and a wisdom beyond anything which the cosmos had ever seen concentrated in one man or group. They had found unholy ways to keep their brains alive, either in the same body or different bodies; and had evidently achieved a way of tapping the consciousness of the dead whom they gathered together. There had, it seems, been some truth in chimerical old Borellus when he wrote of preparing from even the most antique remains certain \"Essential Saltes\" from which the shade of a long-dead living thing might be raised up. There was a formula for evoking such a shade, and another for putting it down; and it had now been so perfected that it could be taught successfully. One must be careful about evocations, for the markers of old graves are not always accurate.      Willett and Mr. Ward shivered as they passed from conclusion to conclusion. Things - presences or voices of some sort - could be drawn down from unknown places as well as from the grave, and in this process also one must be careful. Joseph Curwen had indubitably evoked many forbidden things, and as for Charles - what might one think of him? What forces \"outside the spheres\" had reached him from Joseph Curwens day and turned his mind on forgotten things? He had been led to find certain directions, and he had used them. He had talked with the man of horror in Prague and stayed long with the creature in the mountains of Transylvania. And he must have found the grave of Joseph Curwen at last. That newspaper item and what his mother had heard in the night were too significant to overlook. Then he had summoned something, and it must have come. That mighty voice aloft on Good Friday, and those different tones in the locked attic laboratory. What were they like, with their depth and hollowness? Was there not here some awful foreshadowing of the dreaded stranger Dr. Allen with his spectral bass? Yes, that was what Mr. Ward had felt with vague horror in his single talk with the man - if man it were - over the telephone!      What hellish consciousness or voice, what morbid shade or presence, had come to answer Charles Wards secret rites behind that locked door? Those voices heard in argument - \"must have it red for three months\" - Good God! Was not that just before the vampirism broke out? The rifling of Ezra Weedens ancient grave, and the cries later at Pawtuxet - whose mind had planned the vengeance and rediscovered the shunned seat of elder blasphemies? And then the bungalow and the bearded stranger, and the gossip, and the fear. The final madness of Charles neither father nor doctor could attempt to explain, but they did feel sure that the mind of Joseph Curwen had come to earth again and was following its ancient morbidities. Was daemoniac possession in truth a possibility? Allen had something to do with it, and the detectives must find out more about one whose existence menaced the young mans life. In the meantime, since the existence of some vast crypt beneath the bungalow seemed virtually beyond dispute, some effort must be made to find it. Willett and Mr. Ward, conscious of the sceptical attitude of the alienists, resolved during their final conference to undertake a joint secret exploration of unparalleled thoroughness; and agreed to meet at the bungalow on the following morning with valises and with certain tools and accessories suited to architectural search and underground exploration.      The morning of April 6th dawned clear, and both explorers were at the bungalow by ten oclock. Mr. Ward had the key, and an entry and cursory survey were made. From the disordered condition of Dr. Allens room it was obvious that the detectives had been there before, and the later searchers hoped that they had found some clue which might prove of value. Of course the main business lay in the cellar; so thither they descended without much delay, again making the circuit which each had vainly made before in the presence of the mad young owner. For a time everything seemed baffling, each inch of the earthen floor and stone walls having so solid and innocuous an aspect that the thought of a yawning aperture was scarcely to be entertained. Willett reflected that since the original cellar was dug without knowledge of any catacombs beneath, the beginning of the passage would represent the strictly modern delving of young Ward and his associates, where they had probed for the ancient vaults whose rumour could have reached them by no wholesome means.      The doctor tried to put himself in Charless place to see how a delver would be likely to start, but could not gain much inspiration from this method. Then he decided on elimination as a policy, and went carefully over the whole subterranean surface both vertical and horizontal, trying to account for every inch separately. He was soon substantially narrowed down, and at last had nothing left but the small platform before the washtubs, which he had tried once before in vain. Now experimenting in every possible way, and exerting a double strength, he finally found that the top did indeed turn and slide horizontally on a corner pivot. Beneath it lay a trim concrete surface with an iron manhole, to which Mr. Ward at once rushed with excited zeal. The cover was not hard to lift, and the father had quite removed it when Willett noticed the queerness of his aspect. He was swaying and nodding dizzily, and in the gust of noxious air which swept up from the black pit beneath the doctor soon recognised ample cause.      In a moment Dr. Willett had his fainting companion on the floor above and was reviving him with cold water. Mr. Ward responded feebly, but it could be seen that the mephitic blast from the crypt had in some way gravely sickened him. Wishing to take no chances, Willett hastened out to Broad Street for a taxicab and had soon dispatched the sufferer home despite his weak-voiced protests; after which he produced an electric torch, covered his nostrils with a band of sterile gauze, and descended once more to peer into the new-found depths. The foul air had now slightly abated, and Willett was able to send a beam of light down the Stygian hole. For about ten feet, he saw, it was a sheer cylindrical drop with concrete walls and an iron ladder; after which the hole appeared to strike a flight of old stone steps which must originally have emerged to earth somewhat southwest of the present building.2.      Willett freely admits that for a moment the memory of the old Curwen legends kept him from climbing down alone into that malodorous gulf. He could not help thinking of what Luke Fenner had reported on that last monstrous night. Then duty asserted itself and he made the plunge, carrying a great valise for the removal of whatever papers might prove of supreme importance. Slowly, as befitted one of his years, he descended the ladder and reached the slimy steps below. This was ancient masonry, his torch told him; and upon the dripping walls he saw the unwholesome moss of centuries. Down, down, ran the steps; not spirally, but in three abrupt turns; and with such narrowness that two men could have passed only with difficulty. He had counted about thirty when a sound reached him very faintly; and after that he did not feel disposed to count any more.      It was a godless sound; one of those low-keyed, insidious outrages of Nature which are not meant to be. To call it a dull wail, a doom-dragged whine, or a hopeless howl of chorused anguish and stricken flesh without mind would be to miss its most quintessential loathsomeness and soul-sickening overtones. Was it for this that Ward had seemed to listen on that day he was removed? It was the most shocking thing that Willett had ever heard, and it continued from no determinate point as the doctor reached the bottom of the steps and cast his torchlight around on lofty corridor walls surmounted by Cyclopean vaulting and pierced by numberless black archways. The hall in which he stood was perhaps fourteen feet high to the middle of the vaulting and ten or twelve feet broad. Its pavement was of large chipped flagstones, and its walls and roof were of dressed masonry. Its length he could not imagine, for it stretched ahead indefinitely into the blackness. Of the archways, some had doors of the old six-panelled colonial type, whilst others had none.      Overcoming the dread induced by the smell and the howling, Willett began to explore these archways one by one; finding beyond them rooms with groined stone ceilings, each of medium size and apparently of bizarre uses. Most of them had fireplaces, the upper courses of whose chimneys would have formed an interesting study in engineering. Never before or since had he seen such instruments or suggestions of instruments as here loomed up on every hand through the burying dust and cobwebs of a century and a half, in many cases evidently shattered as if by the ancient raiders. For many of the chambers seemed wholly untrodden by modern feet, and must have represented the earliest and most obsolete phases of Joseph Curwens experimentation. Finally there came a room of obvious modernity, or at least of recent occupancy. There were oil heaters, bookshelves and tables, chairs and cabinets, and a desk piled high with papers of varying antiquity and contemporaneousness. Candlesticks and oil lamps stood about in several places; and finding a match-safe handy, Willett lighted such as were ready for use.      In the fuller gleam it appeared that this apartment was nothing less than the latest study or library of Charles Ward. Of the books the doctor had seen many before, and a good part of the furniture had plainly come from the Prospect Street mansion. Here and there was a piece well known to Willett, and the sense of familiarity became so great that he half forgot the noisomeness and the wailing, both of which were plainer here than they had been at the foot of the steps. His first duty, as planned long ahead, was to find and seize any papers which might seem of vital importance; especially those portentous documents found by Charles so long ago behind the picture in Olney Court. As he searched he perceived how stupendous a task the final unravelling would be; for file on file was stuffed with papers in curious hands and bearing curious designs, so that months or even years might be needed for a thorough deciphering and editing. Once he found large packets of letters with Prague and Rakus postmarks, and in writing clearly recognisable as Ornes and Hutchinsons; all of which he took with him as part of the bundle to be removed in his valise.      At last, in a locked mahogany cabinet once gracing the Ward home, Willett found the batch of old Curwen papers; recognising them from the reluctant glimpse Charles had granted him so many years ago. The youth had evidently kept them together very much as they had been when first he found them, since all the titles recalled by the workmen were present except the papers addressed to Orne and Hutchinson, and the cipher with its key. Willett placed the entire lot in his valise and continued his examination of the files. Since young Wards immediate condition was the greatest matter at stake, the closest searching was done among the most obviously recent matter; and in this abundance of contemporary manuscript one very baffling oddity was noted. The oddity was the slight amount in Charless normal writing, which indeed included nothing more recent than two months before. On the other hand, there were literally reams of symbols and formulae, historical notes and philosophical comment, in a crabbed penmanship absolutely identical with the ancient script of Joseph Curwen, though of undeniably modern dating. Plainly, a part of the latter-day programme had been a sedulous imitation of the old wizards writing, which Charles seemed to have carried to a marvellous state of perfection. Of any third hand which might have been Allens there was not a trace. If he had indeed come to be the leader, he must have forced young Ward to act as his amanuensis.      In this new material one mystic formula, or rather pair of formulae, recurred so often that Willett had it by heart before he had half finished his quest. It consisted of two parallel columns, the left-hand one surmounted by the archaic symbol called \"Dragons Head\" and used in almanacks to indicate the ascending node, and the right-hand one headed by a corresponding sign of \"Dragons Tail\" or descending node. The appearance of the whole was something like this, and almost unconsciously the doctor realised that the second half was no more than the first written syllabically backward with the exception of the final monosyllables and of the odd name Yog-Sothoth, which he had come to recognise under various spellings from other things he had seen in connexion with this horrible matter. The formulae were as follows - exactly so, as Willett is abundantly able to testify - and the first one struck an odd note of uncomfortable latent memory in his brain, which he recognised later when reviewing the events of that horrible Good Friday of the previous year.YAI NGNGAH,YOG-SOTHOTHHEE - LGEBFAI THRODOGUAAAH      \tOGTHROD AIFGEBL - EEHYOG-SOTHOTHNGAHNG AIYZHROSo haunting were these formulae, and so frequently did he come upon them, that before the doctor knew it he was repeating them under his breath. Eventually, however, he felt he had secured all the papers he could digest to advantage for the present; hence resolved to examine no more till he could bring the sceptical alienists en masse for an ampler and more systematic raid. He had still to find the hidden laboratory, so leaving his valise in the lighted room he emerged again into the black noisome corridor whose vaulting echoed ceaselessly with that dull and hideous whine.      The next few rooms he tried were all abandoned, or filled only with crumbling boxes and ominous-looking leaden coffins; but impressed him deeply with the magnitude of Joseph Curwens original operations. He thought of the slaves and seamen who had disappeared, of the graves which had been violated in every part of the world, and of what that final raiding party must have seen; and then he decided it was better not to think any more. Once a great stone staircase mounted at his right, and he deduced that this must have reached to one of the Curwen outbuildings - perhaps the famous stone edifice with the high slit-like windows - provided the steps he had descended had led from the steep-roofed farmhouse. Suddenly the walls seemed to fall away ahead, and the stench and the wailing grew stronger. Willett saw that he had come upon a vast open space, so great that his torchlight would not carry across it; and as he advanced he encountered occasional stout pillars supporting the arches of the roof.      After a time he reached a circle of pillars grouped like the monoliths of Stonehenge, with a large carved altar on a base of three steps in the centre; and so curious were the carvings on that altar that he approached to study them with his electric light. But when he saw what they were he shrank away shuddering, and did not stop to investigate the dark stains which discoloured the upper surface and had spread down the sides in occasional thin lines. Instead, he found the distant wall and traced it as it swept round in a gigantic circle perforated by occasional black doorways and indented by a myriad of shallow cells with iron gratings and wrist and ankle bonds on chains fastened to the stone of the concave rear masonry. These cells were empty, but still the horrible odour and the dismal moaning continued, more insistent now than ever, and seemingly varied at times by a sort of slippery thumping.3.      From that frightful smell and that uncanny noise Willetts attention could no longer be diverted. Both were plainer and more hideous in the great pillared hall than anywhere else, and carried a vague impression of being far below, even in this dark nether world of subterrene mystery. Before trying any of the black archways for steps leading further down, the doctor cast his beam of light about the stone-flagged floor. It was very loosely paved, and at irregular intervals there would occur a slab curiously pierced by small holes in no definite arrangement, while at one point there lay a very long ladder carelessly flung down. To this ladder, singularly enough, appeared to cling a particularly large amount of the frightful odour which encompassed everything. As he walked slowly about it suddenly occurred to Willett that both the noise and the odour seemed strongest directly above the oddly pierced slabs, as if they might be crude trap-doors leading down to some still deeper region of horror. Kneeling by one, he worked at it with his hands, and found that with extreme difficulty he could budge it. At his touch the moaning beneath ascended to a louder key, and only with vast trepidation did he persevere in the lifting of the heavy stone. A stench unnamable now rose up from below, and the doctors head reeled dizzily as he laid back the slab and turned his torch upon the exposed square yard of gaping blackness.      If he had expected a flight of steps to some wide gulf of ultimate abomination, Willett was destined to be disappointed; for amidst that foetor and cracked whining he discerned only the brick-faced top of a cylindrical well perhaps a yard and a half in diameter and devoid of any ladder or other means of descent. As the light shone down, the wailing changed suddenly to a series of horrible yelps; in conjunction with which there came again that sound of blind, futile scrambling and slippery thumping. The explorer trembled, unwilling even to imagine what noxious thing might be lurking in that abyss, but in a moment mustered up the courage to peer over the rough-hewn brink; lying at full length and holding the torch downward at arms length to see what might lie below. For a second he could distinguish nothing but the slimy, moss-grown brick walls sinking illimitably into that half-tangible miasma of murk and foulness and anguished frenzy; and then he saw that something dark was leaping clumsily and frantically up and down at the bottom of the narrow shaft, which must have been from twenty to twenty-five feet below the stone floor where he lay. The torch shook in his hand, but he looked again to see what manner of living creature might be immured there in the darkness of that unnatural well; left starving by young Ward through all the long month since the doctors had taken him away, and clearly only one of a vast number prisoned in the kindred wells whose pierced stone covers so thickly studded in the floor of the great vaulted cavern. Whatever the things were, they could not lie down in their cramped spaces; but must have crouched and whined and waited and feebly leaped all those hideous weeks since their master had abandoned them unheeded.      But Marinus Bicknell Willett was sorry that he looked again; for surgeon and veteran of the dissecting-room though he was, he has not been the same since. It is hard to explain just how a single sight of a tangible object with measureable dimensions could so shake and change a man; and we may only say that there is about certain outlines and entities a power of symbolism and suggestion which acts frightfully on a sensitive thinkers perspective and whispers terrible hints of obscure cosmic relationships and unnamable realities behind the protective illusions of common vision. In that second look Willett saw such an outline or entity, for during the next few instants he was undoubtedly as stark mad as any inmate of Dr. Waites private hospital. He dropped the electric torch from a hand drained of muscular power or nervous cordination, nor heeded the sound of crunching teeth which told of its fate at the bottom of the pit. He screamed and screamed and screamed in a voice whose falsetto panic no acquaintance of his would ever have recognised; and though he could not rise to his feet he crawled and rolled desperately away over the damp pavement where dozens of Tartarean wells poured forth their exhausted whining and yelping to answer his own insane cries. He tore his hands on the rough, loose stones, and many times bruised his head against the frequent pillars, but still he kept on. Then at last he slowly came to himself in the utter blackness and stench, and stopped his ears against the droning wail into which the burst of yelping had subsided. He was drenched with perspiration and without means of producing a light; stricken and unnerved in the abysmal blackness and horror, and crushed with a memory he never could efface. Beneath him dozens of those things still lived, and from one of the shafts the cover was removed. He knew that what he had seen could never climb up the slippery walls, yet shuddered at the thought that some obscure foot-hold might exist.      What the thing was, he would never tell. It was like some of the carvings on the hellish altar, but it was alive. Nature had never made it in this form, for it was too palpably unfinished. The deficiencies were of the most surprising sort, and the abnormalities of proportion could not be described. Willett consents only to say that this type of thing must have represented entities which Ward called up from imperfect salts, and which he kept for servile or ritualistic purposes. If it had not had a certain significance, its image would not have been carved on that damnable stone. It was not the worst thing depicted on that stone - but Willett never opened the other pits. At the time, the first connected idea in his mind was an idle paragraph from some of the old Curwen data he had digested long before; a phrase used by Simon or Jedediah Orne in that portentous confiscated letter to the bygone sorcerer: \"Certainely, there was Nothg butt ye liveliest Awfulness in that which H. raisd upp from What he coud gather onlie a part of.\"      Then, horribly supplementing rather than displacing this image, there came a recollection of those ancient lingering rumours anent the burned, twisted thing found in the fields a week after the Curwen raid. Charles Ward had once told the doctor what old Slocum said of that object; that it was neither thoroughly human, nor wholly allied to any animal which Pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about.      These words hummed in the doctors mind as he rocked to and fro, squatting on the nitrous stone floor. He tried to drive them out, and repeated the Lords Prayer to himself; eventually trailing off into a mnemonic hodge-podge like the modernistic Waste Land of Mr. T. S. Eliot and finally reverting to the oft-repeated dual formula he had lately found in Wards underground library: \"Yai ngngah, Yog-Sothoth\", and so on till the final underlined \"Zhro\". It seemed to soothe him, and he staggered to his feet after a time; lamenting bitterly his fright-lost torch and looking wildly about for any gleam of light in the clutching inkiness of the chilly air. Think he would not; but he strained his eyes in every direction for some faint glint or reflection of the bright illumination he had left in the library. After a while he thought he detected a suspicion of a glow infinitely far away, and toward this he crawled in agonised caution on hands and knees amidst the stench and howling, always feeling ahead lest he collide with the numerous great pillars or stumble into the abominable pit he had uncovered.      Once his shaking fingers touched something which he knew must be the steps leading to the hellish altar, and from this spot he recoiled in loathing. At another time he encountered the pierced slab he had removed, and here his caution became almost pitiful. But he did not come upon the dread aperture after all, nor did anything issue from that aperture to detain him. What had been down there made no sound nor stir. Evidently its crunching of the fallen electric torch had not been good for it. Each time Willetts fingers felt a perforated slab he trembled. His passage over it would sometimes increase the groaning below, but generally it would produce no effect at all, since he moved very noiselessly. Several times during his progress the glow ahead diminished perceptibly, and he realised that the various candles and lamps he had left must be expiring one by one. The thought of being lost in utter darkness without matches amidst this underground world of nightmare labyrinths impelled him to rise to his feet and run, which he could safely do now that he had passed the open pit; for he knew that once the light failed, his only hope of rescue and survival would lie in whatever relief party Mr. Ward might send after missing him for a sufficient period. Presently, however, he emerged from the open space into the narrower corridor and definitely located the glow as coming from a door on his right. In a moment he had reached it and was standing once more in young Wards secret library, trembling with relief, and watching the sputterings of that last lamp which had brought him to safety.4.      In another moment he was hastily filling the burned-out lamps from an oil supply he had previously noticed, and when the room was bright again he looked about to see if he might find a lantern for further exploration. For racked though he was with horror, his sense of grim purpose was still uppermost; and he was firmly determined to leave no stone unturned in his search for the hideous facts behind Charles Wards bizarre madness. Failing to find a lantern, he chose the smallest of the lamps to carry; also filling his pockets with candles and matches, and taking with him a gallon can of oil, which he proposed to keep for reserve use in whatever hidden laboratory he might uncover beyond the terrible open space with its unclean altar and nameless covered wells. To traverse that space again would require his utmost fortitude, but he knew it must be done. Fortunately neither the frightful altar nor the opened shaft was near the vast cell-indented wall which bounded the cavern area, and whose black mysterious archways would form the next goals of a logical search.      So Willett went back to that great pillared hall of stench and anguished howling; turning down his lamp to avoid any distant glimpse of the hellish altar, or of the uncovered pit with the pierced stone slab beside it. Most of the black doorways led merely to small chambers, some vacant and some evidently used as storerooms; and in several of the latter he saw some very curious accumulations of various objects. One was packed with rotting and dust-draped bales of spare clothing, and the explorer thrilled when he saw that it was unmistakably the clothing of a century and a half before. In another room he found numerous odds and ends of modern clothing, as if gradual provisions were being made to equip a large body of men. But what he disliked most of all were the huge copper vats which occasionally appeared; these, and the sinister incrustations upon them. He liked them even less than the weirdly figured leaden bowls whose rims retained such obnoxious deposits and around which clung repellent odours perceptible above even the general noisomeness of the crypt. When he had completed about half the entire circuit of the wall he found another corridor like that from which he had come, and out of which many doors opened. This he proceeded to investigate; and after entering three rooms of medium size and of no significant contents, he came at last to a large oblong apartment whose business-like tanks and tables, furnaces and modern instruments, occasional books and endless shelves of jars and bottles proclaimed it indeed the long-sought laboratory of Charles Ward - and no doubt of old Joseph Curwen before him.      After lighting the three lamps which he found filled and ready, Dr. Willett examined the place and all its appurtenances with the keenest interest; noting from the relative quantities of various reagents on the shelves that young Wards dominant concern must have been with some branch of organic chemistry. On the whole, little could be learned from the scientific ensemble, which included a gruesome-looking dissecting table; so that the room was really rather a disappointment. Among the books was a tattered old copy of Borellus in black-letter, and it was weirdly interesting to note that Ward had underlined the same passage whose marking had so perturbed good Mr. Merritt at Curwens farmhouse more than a century and a half before. That older copy, of course, must have perished along with the rest of Curwens occult library in the final raid. Three archways opened off the laboratory, and these the doctor proceeded to sample in turn. From his cursory survey he saw that two led merely to small storerooms; but these he canvassed with care, remarking the piles of coffins in various stages of damage and shuddering violently at two or three of the few coffin-plates he could decipher. There was much clothing also stored in these rooms, and several new and tightly nailed boxes which he did not stop to investigate. Most interesting of all, perhaps, were some odd bits which he judged to be fragments of old Joseph Curwens laboratory appliances. These had suffered damage at the hands of the raiders, but were still partly recognisable as the chemical paraphernalia of the Georgian period.      The third archway led to a very sizeable chamber entirely lined with shelves and having in the centre a table bearing two lamps. These lamps Willett lighted, and in their brilliant glow studied the endless shelving which surrounded him. Some of the upper levels were wholly vacant, but most of the space was filled with small odd-looking leaden jars of two general types; one tall and without handles like a Grecian lekythos or oil-jug, and the other with a single handle and proportioned like a Phaleron jug. All had metal stoppers, and were covered with peculiar-looking symbols moulded in low relief. In a moment the doctor noticed that these jugs were classified with great rigidity; all the lekythoi being on one side of the room with a large wooden sign reading \"Custodes\" above them, and all the Phalerons on the other, correspondingly labelled with a sign reading \"Materia\". Each of the jars or jugs, except some on the upper shelves that turned out to be vacant, bore a cardboard tag with a number apparently referring to a catalogue; and Willett resolved to look for the latter presently. For the moment, however, he was more interested in the nature of the array as a whole; and experimentally opened several of the lekythoi and Phalerons at random with a view to a rough generalisation. The result was invariable. Both types of jar contained a small quantity of a single kind of substance; a fine dusty powder of very light weight and of many shades of dull, neutral colour. To the colours which formed the only point of variation there was no apparent method of disposal; and no distinction between what occurred in the lekythoi and what occurred in the Phalerons. A bluish-grey powder might be by the side of a pinkish-white one, and any one in a Phaleron might have its exact counterpart in a lekythos. The most individual feature about the powders was their non-adhesiveness. Willett would pour one into his hand, and upon returning it to its jug would find that no residue whatever remained on its palm.      The meaning of the two signs puzzled him, and he wondered why this battery of chemicals was separated so radically from those in glass jars on the shelves of the laboratory proper. \"Custodes\", \"Materia\"; that was the Latin for \"Guards\" and \"Materials\", respectively - and then there came a flash of memory as to where he had seen that word \"Guards\" before in connexion with this dreadful mystery. It was, of course, in the recent letter to Dr. Allen purporting to be from old Edward Hutchinson; and the phrase had read: \"There was no Neede to keep the Guards in Shape and eatg off their Heads, and it made Much to be founde in Case of Trouble, as you too welle knowe.\" What did this signify? But wait - was there not still another reference to \"guards\" in this matter which he had failed wholly to recall when reading the Hutchinson letter? Back in the old non-secretive days Ward had told him of the Eleazar Smith diary recording the spying of Smith and Weeden on the Curwen farm, and in that dreadful chronicle there had been a mention of conversations overheard before the old wizard betook himself wholly beneath the earth. There had been, Smith and Weeden insisted, terrible colloquies wherein figured Curwen, certain captives of his, and the guards of those captives. Those guards, according to Hutchinson or his avatar, had eaten their heads off, so that now Dr. Allen did not keep them in shape. And if not in shape, how save as the \"salts\" to which it appears this wizard band was engaged in reducing as many human bodies or skeletons as they could?      So that was what these lekythoi contained; the monstrous fruit of unhallowed rites and deeds, presumably won or cowed to such submission as to help, when called up by some hellish incantation, in the defence of their blasphemous master or the questioning of those who were not so willing? Willett shuddered at the thought of what he had been pouring in and out of his hands, and for a moment felt an impulse to flee in panic from that cavern of hideous shelves with their silent and perhaps watching sentinels. Then he thought of the \"Materia\" - in the myriad Phaleron jugs on the other side of the room. Salts too - and if not the salts of \"guards\", then the salts of what? God! Could it be possible that here lay the mortal relics of half the titan thinkers of all the ages; snatched by supreme ghouls from crypts where the world thought them safe, and subject to the beck and call of madmen who sought to drain their knowledge for some still wilder end whose ultimate effect would concern, as poor Charles had hinted in his frantic note, all civilisation, all natural law, perhaps even the fate of the solar system and the universe? And Marinus Bicknell Willett had sifted their dust through his hands!      Then he noticed a small door at the farther end of the room, and calmed himself enough to approach it and examine the crude sign chiselled above. It was only a symbol, but it filled him with vague spiritual dread; for a morbid, dreaming friend of his had once drawn it on paper and told him a few of the things it means in the dark abyss of sleep. It was the sign of Koth, that dreamers see fixed above the archway of a certain black tower standing alone in twilight - and Willett did not like what his friend Randolph Carter had said of its powers. But a moment later he forgot the sign as he recognised a new acrid odour in the stench-filled air. This was a chemical rather than animal smell, and came clearly from the room beyond the door. And it was, unmistakably, the same odour which had saturated Charles Wards clothing on the day the doctors had taken him away. So it was here that the youth had been interrupted by the final summons? He was wiser than old Joseph Curwen, for he had not resisted. Willett, boldly determined to penetrate every wonder and nightmare this nether realm might contain, seized the small lamp and crossed the threshold. A wave of nameless fright rolled out to meet him, but he yielded to no whim and deferred to no intuition. There was nothing alive here to harm him, and he would not be stayed in his piercing of the eldritch cloud which engulfed his patient.      The room beyond the door was of medium size, and had no furniture save a table, a single chair, and two groups of curious machines with clamps and wheels, which Willett recognised after a moment as mediaeval instruments of torture. On one side of the door stood a rack of savage whips, above which were some shelves bearing empty rows of shallow pedestalled cups of lead shaped like Grecian kylikes. On the other side was the table; with a powerful Argand lamp, a pad and pencil, and two of the stoppered lekythoi from the shelves outside set down at irregular places as if temporarily or in haste. Willett lighted the lamp and looked carefully at the pad, to see what notes young Ward might have been jotting down when interrupted; but found nothing more intelligible than the following disjointed fragments in that crabbed Curwen chirography, which shed no light on the case as a whole:\"B. dyd not. Escapd into walls and founde Place below.\"Saw olde V. saye ye Sabaoth and learnt ye Way.\"Raisd Yog-Sothoth thrice and was ye nexte Day deliverd.\"F. soughte to wipe out all knowg howe to raise Those from Outside.\"      As the strong Argand blaze lit up the entire chamber the doctor saw that the wall opposite the door, between the two groups of torturing appliances in the corners, was covered with pegs from which hung a set of shapeless-looking robes of a rather dismal yellowish-white. But far more interesting were the two vacant walls, both of which were thickly covered with mystic symbols and formulae roughly chiselled in the smooth dressed stone. The damp floor also bore marks of carving; and with but little difficulty Willett deciphered a huge pentagram in the centre, with a plain circle about three feet wide half way between this and each corner. In one of these four circles, near where a yellowish robe had been flung carelessly down, there stood a shallow kylix of the sort found on the shelves above the whip-rack; and just outside the periphery was one of the Phaleron jugs from the shelves in the other room, its tag numbered 118. This was unstoppered, and proved upon inspection to be empty; but the explorer saw with a shiver that the kylix was not. Within its shallow area, and saved from scattering only by the absence of wind in this sequestered cavern, lay a small amount of a dry, dull-greenish efflorescent powder which must have belonged in the jug; and Willett almost reeled at the implications that came sweeping over him as he correlated little by little the several elements and antecedents of the scene. The whips and the instruments of torture, the dust or salts from the jug of \"Materia\", the two lekythoi from the \"Custodes\" shelf, the robes, the formulae on the walls, the notes on the pad, the hints from letters and legends, and the thousand glimpses, doubts, and suppositions which had come to torment the friends and parents of Charles Ward - all these engulfed the doctor in a tidal wave of horror as he looked at that dry greenish powder outspread in the pedestalled leaden kylix on the floor.      With an effort, however, Willett pulled himself together and began studying the formulae chiselled on the walls. From the stained and incrusted letters it was obvious that they were carved in Joseph Curwens time, and their text was such as to be vaguely familiar to one who had read much Curwen material or delved extensively into the history of magic. One the doctor clearly recognised as what Mrs. Ward heard her son chanting on that ominous Good Friday a year before, and what an authority had told him was a very terrible invocation addressed to secret gods outside the normal spheres. It was not spelled here exactly as Mrs. Ward had set it down from memory, nor yet as the authority had shewn it to him in the forbidden pages of \"Eliphas Levi\"; but its identity was unmistakable, and such words as Sabaoth, Metraton, Almousin, and Zariatnatmik sent a shudder of fright through the searcher who had seen and felt so much of cosmic abomination just around the corner.      This was on the left-hand wall as one entered the room. The right-hand wall was no less thickly inscribed, and Willett felt a start of recognition as he came upon the pair of formulae so frequently occurring in the recent notes in the library. They were, roughly speaking, the same; with the ancient symbols of \"Dragons Head\" and \"Dragons Tail\" heading them as in Wards scribblings. But the spelling differed quite widely from that of the modern versions, as if old Curwen had had a different way of recording sound, or as if later study had evolved more powerful and perfected variants of the invocations in question. The doctor tried to reconcile the chiselled version with the one which still ran persistently in his head, and found it hard to do. Where the script he had memorised began \"Yai ngngah, Yog-Sothoth\", this epigraph started out as \"Aye, engengah, Yogge-Sothotha\"; which to his mind would seriously interfere with the syllabification of the second word.      Ground as the later text was into his consciousness, the discrepancy disturbed him; and he found himself chanting the first of the formulae aloud in an effort to square the sound he conceived with the letters he found carved. Weird and menacing in that abyss of antique blasphemy rang his voice; its accents keyed to a droning sing-song either through the spell of the past and the unknown, or through the hellish example of that dull, godless wail from the pits whose inhuman cadences rose and fell rhythmically in the distance through the stench and the darkness.\"YAI NGNGAH,YOG-SOTHOTHHEE - LGEBFAI THRODOGUAAAH!\"      But what was this cold wind which had sprung into life at the very outset of the chant? The lamps were sputtering woefully, and the gloom grew so dense that the letters on the wall nearly faded from sight. There was smoke, too, and an acrid odour which quite drowned out the stench from the far-away wells; an odour like that he had smelt before, yet infinitely stronger and more pungent. He turned from the inscriptions to face the room with its bizarre contents, and saw that the kylix on the floor, in which the ominous efflorescent powder had lain, was giving forth a cloud of thick, greenish-black vapour of surprising volume and opacity. That powder - Great God! it had come from the shelf of \"Materia\" - what was it doing now, and what had started it? The formula he had been chanting - the first of the pair - Dragons Head, ascending node - Blessed Saviour, could it be. . . .      The doctor reeled, and through his head raced wildly disjointed scraps from all he had seen, heard, and read of the frightful case of Joseph Curwen and Charles Dexter Ward. \"I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe. . . . Have ye Wordes for laying at all times readie, and stopp not to be sure when there is any Doubte of Whom you have. . . . Three Talkes with What was therein inhumd. . . .\" Mercy of Heaven, what is that shape behind the parting smoke?5.      Marinus Bicknell Willett has no hope that any part of his tale will be believed except by certain sympathetic friends, hence he has made no attempt to tell it beyond his most intimate circle. Only a few outsiders have ever heard it repeated, and of these the majority laugh and remark that the doctor surely is getting old. He has been advised to take a long vacation and to shun future cases dealing with mental disturbance. But Mr. Ward knows that the veteran physician speaks only a horrible truth. Did not he himself see the noisome aperture in the bungalow cellar? Did not Willett send him home overcome and ill at eleven oclock that portentous morning? Did he not telephone the doctor in vain that evening, and again the next day, and had he not driven to the bungalow itself on that following noon, finding his friend unconscious but unharmed on one of the beds upstairs? Willett had been breathing stertorously, and opened his eyes slowly when Mr. Ward gave him some brandy fetched from the car. Then he shuddered and screamed, crying out, \"That beard . . . those eyes. . . . God, who are you?\" A very strange thing to say to a trim, blue-eyed, clean-shaven gentleman whom he had known from the latters boyhood.      In the bright noon sunlight the bungalow was unchanged since the previous morning. Willetts clothing bore no disarrangement beyond certain smudges and worn places at the knees, and only a faint acrid odour reminded Mr. Ward of what he had smelt on his son that day he was taken to the hospital. The doctors flashlight was missing, but his valise was safely there, as empty as when he had brought it. Before indulging in any explanations, and obviously with great moral effort, Willett staggered dizzily down to the cellar and tried the fateful platform before the tubs. It was unyielding. Crossing to where he had left his yet unused tool satchel the day before, he obtained a chisel and began to pry up the stubborn planks one by one. Underneath the smooth concrete was still visible, but of any opening or perforation there was no longer a trace. Nothing yawned this time to sicken the mystified father who had followed the doctor downstairs; only the smooth concrete underneath the planks - no noisome well, no world of subterrene horrors, no secret library, no Curwen papers, no nightmare pits of stench and howling, no laboratory or shelves or chiselled formulae, no. . . . Dr. Willett turned pale, and clutched at the younger man. \"Yesterday,\" he asked softly, \"did you see it here . . . and smell it?\" And when Mr. Ward, himself transfixed with dread and wonder, found strength to nod an affirmative, the physician gave a sound half a sigh and half a gasp, and nodded in turn. \"Then I will tell you,\" he said.      So for an hour, in the sunniest room they could find upstairs, the physician whispered his frightful tale to the wondering father. There was nothing to relate beyond the looming up of that form when the greenish-black vapour from the kylix parted, and Willett was too tired to ask himself what had really occurred. There were futile, bewildered head-shakings from both men, and once Mr. Ward ventured a hushed suggestion, \"Do you suppose it would be of any use to dig?\" The doctor was silent, for it seemed hardly fitting for any human brain to answer when powers of unknown spheres had so vitally encroached on this side of the Great Abyss. Again Mr. Ward asked, \"But where did it go? It brought you here, you know, and it sealed up the hole somehow.\" And Willett again let silence answer for him.      But after all, this was not the final phase of the matter. Reaching for his handkerchief before rising to leave, Dr. Willetts fingers closed upon a piece of paper in his pocket which had not been there before, and which was companioned by the candles and matches he had seized in the vanished vault. It was a common sheet, torn obviously from the cheap pad in that fabulous room of horror somewhere underground, and the writing upon it was that of an ordinary lead pencil - doubtless the one which had lain beside the pad. It was folded very carelessly, and beyond the faint acrid scent of the cryptic chamber bore no print or mark of any world but this. But in the text itself it did indeed reek with wonder; for here was no script of any wholesome age, but the laboured strokes of mediaeval darkness, scarcely legible to the laymen who now strained over it, yet having combinations of symbols which seemed vaguely familiar. The briefly scrawled message was this, and its mystery lent purpose to the shaken pair, who forthwith walked steadily out to the Ward car and gave orders to be driven first to a quiet dining place and then to the John Hay Library on the hill.      At the library it was easy to find good manuals of palaeography, and over these the two men puzzled till the lights of evening shone out from the great chandelier. In the end they found what was needed. The letters were indeed no fantastic invention, but the normal script of a very dark period. They were the pointed Saxon minuscules of the eighth or ninth century A.D., and brought with them memories of an uncouth time when under a fresh Christian veneer ancient faiths and ancient rites stirred stealthily, and the pale moon of Britain looked sometimes on strange deeds in the Roman ruins of Caerleon and Hexham, and by the towers along Hadrians crumbling wall. The words were in such Latin as a barbarous age might remember - \"Corvinus necandus est. Cadaver aq(ua) forti dissolvendum, nec aliq(ui)d retinendum. Tace ut potes.\" - which may roughly be translated, \"Curwen must be killed. The body must be dissolved in aqua fortis, nor must anything be retained. Keep silence as best you are able.\"      Willett and Mr. Ward were mute and baffled. They had met the unknown, and found that they lacked emotions to respond to it as they vaguely believed they ought. With Willett, especially, the capacity for receiving fresh impressions of awe was well-nigh exhausted; and both men sat still and helpless till the closing of the library forced them to leave. Then they drove listlessly to the Ward mansion in Prospect Street, and talked to no purpose into the night. The doctor rested toward morning, but did not go home. And he was still there Sunday noon when a telephone message came from the detectives who had been assigned to look up Dr. Allen.      Mr. Ward, who was pacing nervously about in a dressing-gown, answered the call in person; and told the men to come up early the next day when he heard their report was almost ready. Both Willett and he were glad that this phase of the matter was taking form, for whatever the origin of the strange minuscule message, it seemed certain that the \"Curwen\" who must be destroyed could be no other than the bearded and spectacled stranger. Charles had feared this man, and had said in the frantic note that he must be killed and dissolved in acid. Allen, moreover, had been receiving letters from the strange wizards in Europe under the name of Curwen, and palpably regarded himself as an avatar of the bygone necromancer. And now from a fresh and unknown source had come a message saying that \"Curwen\" must be killed and dissolved in acid. The linkage was too unmistakable to be factitious; and besides, was not Allen planning to murder young Ward upon the advice of the creature called Hutchinson? Of course, the letter they had seen had never reached the bearded stranger; but from its text they could see that Allen had already formed plans for dealing with the youth if he grew too squeamish. Without doubt, Allen must be apprehended; and even if the most drastic directions were not carried out, he must be placed where he could inflict no harm upon Charles Ward.      That afternoon, hoping against hope to extract some gleam of information anent the inmost mysteries from the only available one capable of giving it, the father and the doctor went down the bay and called on young Charles at the hospital. Simply and gravely Willett told him all he had found, and noticed how pale he turned as each description made certain the truth of the discovery. The physician employed as much dramatic effect as he could, and watched for a wincing on Charless part when he approached the matter of the covered pits and the nameless hybrids within. But Ward did not wince. Willett paused, and his voice grew indignant as he spoke of how the things were starving. He taxed the youth with shocking inhumanity, and shivered when only a sardonic laugh came in reply. For Charles, having dropped as useless his pretence that the crypt did not exist, seemed to see some ghastly jest in this affair; and chuckled hoarsely at something which amused him. Then he whispered, in accents doubly terrible because of the cracked voice he used, \"Damn em, they do eat, but they dont need to! Thats the rare part! A month, you say, without food? Lud, Sir, you be modest! Dye know, that was the joke on poor old Whipple with his virtuous bluster! Kill everything off, would he? Why, damme, he was half-deaf with the noise from Outside and never saw or heard aught from the wells! He never dreamed they were there at all! Devil take ye, those cursed things have been howling down there ever since Curwen was done for a hundred and fifty-seven years gone!\"      But no more than this could Willett get from the youth. Horrified, yet almost convinced against his will, he went on with his tale in the hope that some incident might startle his auditor out of the mad composure he maintained. Looking at the youths face, the doctor could not but feel a kind of terror at the changes which recent months had wrought. Truly, the boy had drawn down nameless horrors from the skies. When the room with the formulae and the greenish dust was mentioned, Charles shewed his first sign of animation. A quizzical look overspread his face as he heard what Willett had read on the pad, and he ventured the mild statement that those notes were old ones, of no possible significance to anyone not deeply initiated in the history of magic. \"But,\" he added, \"had you but known the words to bring up that which I had out in the cup, you had not been here to tell me this. Twas Number 118, and I conceive you would have shook had you looked it up in my list in tother room. Twas never raised by me, but I meant to have it up that day you came to invite me hither.\"      Then Willett told of the formula he had spoken and of the greenish-black smoke which had arisen; and as he did so he saw true fear dawn for the first time on Charles Wards face. \"It came, and you be here alive?\" As Ward croaked the words his voice seemed almost to burst free of its trammels and sink to cavernous abysses of uncanny resonance. Willett, gifted with a flash of inspiration, believed he saw the situation, and wove into his reply a caution from a letter he remembered. \"No. 118, you say? But dont forget that stones are all changed now in nine grounds out of ten. You are never sure till you question!\" And then, without warning, he drew forth the minuscule message and flashed it before the patients eyes. He could have wished no stronger result, for Charles Ward fainted forthwith.      All this conversation, of course, had been conducted with the greatest secrecy lest the resident alienists accuse the father and the physician of encouraging a madman in his delusions. Unaided, too, Dr. Willett and Mr. Ward picked up the stricken youth and placed him on the couch. In reviving, the patient mumbled many times of some word which he must get to Orne and Hutchinson at once; so when his consciousness seemed fully back the doctor told him that of those strange creatures at least one was his bitter enemy, and had given Dr. Allen advice for his assassination. This revelation produced no visible effect, and before it was made the visitors could see that their host had already the look of a hunted man. After that he would converse no more, so Willett and the father departed presently; leaving behind a caution against the bearded Allen, to which the youth only replied that this individual was very safely taken care of, and could do no one any harm even if he wished. This was said with an almost evil chuckle very painful to hear. They did not worry about any communications Charles might indite to that monstrous pair in Europe, since they knew that the hospital authorities seized all outgoing mail for censorship and would pass no wild or outr-looking missive.      There is, however, a curious sequel to the matter of Orne and Hutchinson, if such indeed the exiled wizards were. Moved by some vague presentiment amidst the horrors of that period, Willett arranged with an international press-cutting bureau for accounts of notable current crimes and accidents in Prague and in eastern Transylvania; and after six months believed that he had found two very significant things amongst the multifarious items he received and had translated. One was the total wrecking of a house by night in the oldest quarter of Prague, and the disappearance of the evil old man called Josef Nadek, who had dwelt in it alone ever since anyone could remember. The other was a titan explosion in the Transylvanian mountains east of Rakus, and the utter extirpation with all its inmates of the ill-regarded Castle Ferenczy, whose master was so badly spoken of by peasants and soldiery alike that he would shortly have been summoned to Bucharest for serious questioning had not this incident cut off a career already so long as to antedate all common memory. Willett maintains that the hand which wrote those minuscules was able to wield stronger weapons as well; and that while Curwen was left to him to dispose of, the writer felt able to find and deal with Orne and Hutchinson itself. Of what their fate may have been the doctor strives sedulously not to think.6.      The following morning Dr. Willett hastened to the Ward home to be present when the detectives arrived. Allens destruction or imprisonment - or Curwens, if one might regard the tacit claim to reincarnation as valid - he felt must be accomplished at any cost, and he communicated this conviction to Mr. Ward as they sat waiting for the men to come. They were downstairs this time, for the upper parts of the house were beginning to be shunned because of a peculiar nauseousness which hung indefinitely about; a nauseousness which the older servants connected with some curse left by the vanished Curwen portrait.      At nine oclock the three detectives presented themselves and immediately delivered all that they had to say. They had not, regrettably enough, located the Brava Tony Gomes as they had wished, nor had they found the least trace of Dr. Allens source or present whereabouts; but they had managed to unearth a considerable number of local impressions and facts concerning the reticent stranger. Allen had struck Pawtuxet people as a vaguely unnatural being, and there was an universal belief that his thick sandy beard was either dyed or false - a belief conclusively upheld by the finding of such a false beard, together with a pair of dark glasses, in his room at the fateful bungalow. His voice, Mr. Ward could well testify from his one telephone conversation, had a depth and hollowness that could not be forgotten; and his glance seemed malign even through his smoked and horn-rimmed glasses. One shopkeeper, in the course of negotiations, had seen a specimen of his handwriting and declared it was very queer and crabbed; this being confirmed by pencilled notes of no clear meaning found in his room and identified by the merchant. In connexion with the vampirism rumours of the preceding summer, a majority of the gossips believed that Allen rather than Ward was the actual vampire. Statements were also obtained from the officials who had visited the bungalow after the unpleasant incident of the motor truck robbery. They had felt less of the sinister in Dr. Allen, but had recognised him as the dominant figure in the queer shadowy cottage. The place had been too dark for them to observe him clearly, but they would know him again if they saw him. His beard had looked odd, and they thought he had some slight scar above his dark spectacled right eye. As for the detectives search of Allens room, it yielded nothing definite save the beard and glasses, and several pencilled notes in a crabbed writing which Willett at once saw was identical with that shared by the old Curwen manuscripts and by the voluminous recent notes of young Ward found in the vanished catacombs of horror.      Dr. Willett and Mr. Ward caught something of a profound, subtle, and insidious cosmic fear from this data as it was gradually unfolded, and almost trembled in following up the vague, mad thought which had simultaneously reached their minds. The false beard and glasses - the crabbed Curwen penmanship - the old portrait and its tiny scar - and the altered youth in the hospital with such a scar - that deep, hollow voice on the telephone - was it not of this that Mr. Ward was reminded when his son barked forth those pitiable tones to which he now claimed to be reduced? Who had ever seen Charles and Allen together? Yes, the officials had once, but who later on? Was it not when Allen left that Charles suddenly lost his growing fright and began to live wholly at the bungalow? Curwen - Allen - Ward - in what blasphemous and abominable fusion had two ages and two persons become involved? That damnable resemblance of the picture to Charles - had it not used to stare and stare, and follow the boy around the room with its eyes? Why, too, did both Allen and Charles copy Joseph Curwens handwriting, even when alone and off guard? And then the frightful work of those people - the lost crypt of horrors that had aged the doctor overnight; the starved monsters in the noisome pits; the awful formula which had yielded such nameless results; the message in minuscules found in Willetts pocket; the papers and the letters and all the talk of graves and \"salts\" and discoveries - whither did everything lead? In the end Mr. Ward did the most sensible thing. Steeling himself against any realisation of why he did it, he gave the detectives an article to be shewn to such Pawtuxet shopkeepers as had seen the portentous Dr. Allen. That article was a photograph of his luckless son, on which he now carefully drew in ink the pair of heavy glasses and the black pointed beard which the men had brought from Allens room.      For two hours he waited with the doctor in the oppressive house where fear and miasma were slowly gathering as the empty panel in the upstairs library leered and leered and leered. Then the men returned. Yes. The altered photograph was a very passable likeness of Dr. Allen. Mr. Ward turned pale, and Willett wiped a suddenly dampened brow with his handkerchief. Allen - Ward - Curwen - it was becoming too hideous for coherent thought. What had the boy called out of the void, and what had it done to him? What, really, had happened from first to last? Who was this Allen who sought to kill Charles as too squeamish, and why had his destined victim said in the postscript to that frantic letter that he must be so completely obliterated in acid? Why, too, had the minuscule message, of whose origin no one dared think, said that \"Curwen\" must be likewise obliterated? What was the change, and when had the final stage occurred? That day when his frantic note was received - he had been nervous all the morning, then there was an alteration. He had slipped out unseen and swaggered boldly in past the men hired to guard him. That was the time, when he was out. But no - had he not cried out in terror as he entered his study - this very room? What had he found there? Or wait - what had found him? That simulacrum which brushed boldly in without having been seen to go - was that an alien shadow and a horror forcing itself upon a trembling figure which had never gone out at all? Had not the butler spoken of queer noises?      Willett rang for the man and asked him some low-toned questions. It had, surely enough, been a bad business. There had been noises - a cry, a gasp, a choking, and a sort of clattering or creaking or thumping, or all of these. And Mr. Charles was not the same when he stalked out without a word. The butler shivered as he spoke, and sniffed at the heavy air that blew down from some open window upstairs. Terror had settled definitely upon the house, and only the business-like detectives failed to imbibe a full measure of it. Even they were restless, for this case had held vague elements in the background which pleased them not at all. Dr. Willett was thinking deeply and rapidly, and his thoughts were terrible ones. Now and then he would almost break into muttering as he ran over in his head a new, appalling, and increasingly conclusive chain of nightmare happenings.      Then Mr. Ward made a sign that the conference was over, and everyone save him and the doctor left the room. It was noon now, but shadows as of coming night seemed to engulf the phantom-haunted mansion. Willett began talking very seriously to his host, and urged that he leave a great deal of the future investigation to him. There would be, he predicted, certain obnoxious elements which a friend could bear better than a relative. As family physician he must have a free hand, and the first thing he required was a period alone and undisturbed in the abandoned library upstairs, where the ancient overmantel had gathered about itself an aura of noisome horror more intense than when Joseph Curwens features themselves glanced slyly down from the painted panel.      Mr. Ward, dazed by the flood of grotesque morbidities and unthinkably maddening suggestions that poured in upon him from every side, could only acquiesce; and half an hour later the doctor was locked in the shunned room with the panelling from Olney Court. The father, listening outside, heard fumbling sounds of moving and rummaging as the moments passed; and finally a wrench and a creak, as if a tight cupboard door were being opened. Then there was a muffled cry, a kind of snorting choke, and a hasty slamming of whatever had been opened. Almost at once the key rattled and Willett appeared in the hall, haggard and ghastly, and demanding wood for the real fireplace on the south wall of the room. The furnace was not enough, he said; and the electric log had little practical use. Longing yet not daring to ask questions, Mr. Ward gave the requisite orders and a man brought some stout pine logs, shuddering as he entered the tainted air of the library to place them in the grate. Willett meanwhile had gone up to the dismantled laboratory and brought down a few odds and ends not included in the moving of the July before. They were in a covered basket, and Mr. Ward never saw what they were.      Then the doctor locked himself in the library once more, and by the clouds of smoke which rolled down past the windows from the chimney it was known that he had lighted the fire. Later, after a great rustling of newspapers, that odd wrench and creaking were heard again; followed by a thumping which none of the eavesdroppers liked. Thereafter two suppressed cries of Willetts were heard, and hard upon these came a swishing rustle of indefinable hatefulness. Finally the smoke that the wind beat down from the chimney grew very dark and acrid, and everyone wished that the weather had spared them this choking and venomous inundation of peculiar fumes. Mr. Wards head reeled, and the servants all clustered together in a knot to watch the horrible black smoke swoop down. After an age of waiting the vapours seemed to lighten, and half-formless sounds of scraping, sweeping, and other minor operations were heard behind the bolted door. And at last, after the slamming of some cupboard within, Willett made his appearance - sad, pale, and haggard, and bearing the cloth-draped basket he had taken from the upstairs laboratory. He had left the window open, and into that once accursed room was pouring a wealth of pure, wholesome air to mix with a queer new smell of disinfectants. The ancient overmantel still lingered; but it seemed robbed of malignity now, and rose as calm and stately in its white panelling as if it had never borne the picture of Joseph Curwen. Night was coming on, yet this time its shadows held no latent fright, but only a gentle melancholy. Of what he had done the doctor would never speak. To Mr. Ward he said, \"I can answer no questions, but I will say that there are different kinds of magic. I have made a great purgation, and those in this house will sleep the better for it.\"7.      That Dr. Willetts \"purgation\" had been an ordeal almost as nerve-racking in its way as his hideous wandering in the vanished crypt is shewn by the fact that the elderly physician gave out completely as soon as he reached home that evening. For three days he rested constantly in his room, though servants later muttered something about having heard him after midnight on Wednesday, when the outer door softly opened and closed with phenomenal softness. Servants imaginations, fortunately, are limited, else comment might have been excited by an item in Thursdays Evening Bulletin which ran as follows:North End GhoulsActive AgainAfter a lull of ten months since the dastardly vandalism in the Weeden lot at the North Burial Ground, a nocturnal prowler was glimpsed early this morning in the same cemetery by Robert Hart, the night watchman. Happening to glance for a moment from his shelter at about 2 a.m., Hart observed the glow of a lantern or pocket torch not far to the northwest, and upon opening the door detected the figure of a man with a trowel very plainly silhouetted against a nearby electric light. At once starting in pursuit, he saw the figure dart hurriedly toward the main entrance, gaining the street and losing himself among the shadows before approach or capture was possible.      Like the first of the ghouls active during the past year, this intruder had done no real damage before detection. A vacant part of the Ward lot shewed signs of a little superficial digging, but nothing even nearly the size of a grave had been attempted, and no previous grave had been disturbed.      Hart, who cannot describe the prowler except as a small man probably having a full beard, inclines to the view that all three of the digging incidents have a common source; but police from the Second Station think otherwise on account of the savage nature of the second incident, where an ancient coffin was removed and its headstone violently shattered.      The first of the incidents, in which it is thought an attempt to bury something was frustrated, occurred a year ago last March, and has been attributed to bootleggers seeking a cache. It is possible, says Sergt. Riley, that this third affair is of similar nature. Officers at the Second Station are taking especial pains to capture the gang of miscreants responsible for these repeated outrages.      All day Thursday Dr. Willett rested as if recuperating from something past or nerving himself for something to come. In the evening he wrote a note to Mr. Ward, which was delivered the next morning and which caused the half-dazed parent to ponder long and deeply. Mr. Ward had not been able to go down to business since the shock of Monday with its baffling reports and its sinister \"purgation\", but he found something calming about the doctors letter in spite of the despair it seemed to promise and the fresh mysteries it seemed to evoke.\"10 Barnes St.,            Providence, R.I.,      April 12, 1928.\"Dear Theodore: - I feel that I must say a word to you before doing what I am going to do tomorrow. It will conclude the terrible business we have been going through (for I feel that no spade is ever likely to reach that monstrous place we know of), but Im afraid it wont set your mind at rest unless I expressly assure you how very conclusive it is.      \"You have known me ever since you were a small boy, so I think you will not distrust me when I hint that some matters are best left undecided and unexplored. It is better that you attempt no further speculation as to Charless case, and almost imperative that you tell his mother nothing more than she already suspects. When I call on you tomorrow Charles will have escaped. That is all which need remain in anyones mind. He was mad, and he escaped. You can tell his mother gently and gradually about the mad part when you stop sending the typed notes in his name. Id advise you to join her in Atlantic City and take a rest yourself. God knows you need one after this shock, as I do myself. I am going South for a while to calm down and brace up.      \"So dont ask me any questions when I call. It may be that something will go wrong, but Ill tell you if it does. I dont think it will. There will be nothing more to worry about, for Charles will be very, very safe. He is now - safer than you dream. You need hold no fears about Allen, and who or what he is. He forms as much a part of the past as Joseph Curwens picture, and when I ring your doorbell you may feel certain that there is no such person. And what wrote that minuscule message will never trouble you or yours.      \"But you must steel yourself to melancholy, and prepare your wife to do the same. I must tell you frankly that Charless escape will not mean his restoration to you. He has been afflicted with a peculiar disease, as you must realise from the subtle physical as well as mental changes in him, and you must not hope to see him again. Have only this consolation - that he was never a fiend or even truly a madman, but only an eager, studious, and curious boy whose love of mystery and of the past was his undoing. He stumbled on things no mortal ought ever to know, and reached back through the years as no one ever should reach; and something came out of those years to engulf him.      \"And now comes the matter in which I must ask you to trust me most of all. For there will be, indeed, no uncertainty about Charless fate. In about a year, say, you can if you wish devise a suitable account of the end; for the boy will be no more. You can put up a stone in your lot at the North Burial Ground exactly ten feet west of your fathers and facing the same way, and that will mark the true resting-place of your son. Nor need you fear that it will mark any abnormality or changeling. The ashes in that grave will be those of your own unaltered bone and sinew - of the real Charles Dexter Ward whose mind you watched from infancy - the real Charles with the olive-mark on his hip and without the black witch-mark on his chest or the pit on his forehead. The Charles who never did actual evil, and who will have paid with his life for his squeamishness.      \"That is all. Charles will have escaped, and a year from now you can put up his stone. Do not question me tomorrow. And believe that the honour of your ancient family remains untainted now, as it has been at all times in the past.      \"With profoundest sympathy, and exhortations to fortitude, calmness, and resignation, I am everSincerely your friend,      Marinus B. Willett\"      So on the morning of Friday, April 13, 1928, Marinus Bicknell Willett visited the room of Charles Dexter Ward at Dr. Waites private hospital on Conanicut Island. The youth, though making no attempt to evade his caller, was in a sullen mood; and seemed disinclined to open the conversation which Willett obviously desired. The doctors discovery of the crypt and his monstrous experience therein had of course created a new source of embarrassment, so that both hesitated perceptibly after the interchange of a few strained formalities. Then a new element of constraint crept in, as Ward seemed to read behind the doctors mask-like face a terrible purpose which had never been there before. The patient quailed, conscious that since the last visit there had been a change whereby the solicitous family physician had given place to the ruthless and implacable avenger.      Ward actually turned pale, and the doctor was the first to speak. \"More,\" he said, \"has been found out, and I must warn you fairly that a reckoning is due.\"      \"Digging again, and coming upon more poor starving pets?\" was the ironic reply. It was evident that the youth meant to shew bravado to the last.      \"No,\" Willett slowly rejoined, \"this time I did not have to dig. We have had men looking up Dr. Allen, and they found the false beard and spectacles in the bungalow.\"      \"Excellent,\" commented the disquieted host in an effort to be wittily insulting, \"and I trust they proved more becoming than the beard and glasses you now have on!\"      \"They would become you very well,\" came the even and studied response, \"as indeed they seem to have done.\"      As Willett said this, it almost seemed as though a cloud passed over the sun; though there was no change in the shadows on the floor. Then Ward ventured:      \"And is this what asks so hotly for a reckoning? Suppose a man does find it now and then useful to be twofold?\"      \"No,\" said Willett gravely, \"again you are wrong. It is no business of mine if any man seeks duality; provided he has any right to exist at all, and provided he does not destroy what called him out of space.\"      Ward now started violently. \"Well, Sir, what have ye found, and what dye want with me?\"      The doctor let a little time elapse before replying, as if choosing his words for an effective answer.      \"I have found,\" he finally intoned, \"something in a cupboard behind an ancient overmantel where a picture once was, and I have burned it and buried the ashes where the grave of Charles Dexter Ward ought to be.\"      The madman choked and sprang from the chair in which he had been sitting:      \"Damn ye, who did ye tell - and wholl believe it was he after these full two months, with me alive? What dye mean to do?\"      Willett, though a small man, actually took on a kind of judicial majesty as he calmed the patient with a gesture.      \"I have told no one. This is no common case - it is a madness out of time and a horror from beyond the spheres which no police or lawyers or courts or alienists could ever fathom or grapple with. Thank God some chance has left inside me the spark of imagination, that I might not go astray in thinking out this thing. You cannot deceive me, Joseph Curwen, for I know that your accursed magic is true!      \"I know how you wove the spell that brooded outside the years and fastened on your double and descendant; I know how you drew him into the past and got him to raise you up from your detestable grave; I know how he kept you hidden in his laboratory while you studied modern things and roved abroad as a vampire by night, and how you later shewed yourself in beard and glasses that no one might wonder at your godless likeness to him; I know what you resolved to do when he balked at your monstrous rifling of the worlds tombs, and at what you planned afterward, and I know how you did it.      \"You left off your beard and glasses and fooled the guards around the house. They thought it was he who went in, and they thought it was he who came out when you had strangled and hidden him. But you hadnt reckoned on the different contents of two minds. You were a fool, Curwen, to fancy that a mere visual identity would be enough. Why didnt you think of the speech and the voice and the handwriting? It hasnt worked, you see, after all. You know better than I who or what wrote that message in minuscules, but I will warn you it was not written in vain. There are abominations and blasphemies which must be stamped out, and I believe that the writer of those words will attend to Orne and Hutchinson. One of those creatures wrote you once, do not call up any that you can not put down. You were undone once before, perhaps in that very way, and it may be that your own evil magic will undo you all again. Curwen, a man cant tamper with Nature beyond certain limits, and every horror you have woven will rise up to wipe you out.\"      But here the doctor was cut short by a convulsive cry from the creature before him. Hopelessly at bay, weaponless, and knowing that any show of physical violence would bring a score of attendants to the doctors rescue, Joseph Curwen had recourse to his one ancient ally, and began a series of cabbalistic motions with his forefingers as his deep, hollow voice, now unconcealed by feigned hoarseness, bellowed out the opening words of a terrible formula.      \"PER ADONAI ELOIM, ADONAI JEHOVA, ADONAI SABAOTH, METRATON. . . .\"      But Willett was too quick for him. Even as the dogs in the yard outside began to howl, and even as a chill wind sprang suddenly up from the bay, the doctor commenced the solemn and measured intonation of that which he had meant all along to recite. An eye for an eye - magic for magic - let the outcome shew how well the lesson of the abyss had been learned! So in a clear voice Marinus Bicknell Willett began the second of that pair of formulae whose first had raised the writer of those minuscules - the cryptic invocation whose heading was the Dragons Tail, sign of the descending node - \"OGTHROD AIFGEBL - EEHYOG-SOTHOTHNGAHNG AIYZHRO!\"      At the very first word from Willetts mouth the previously commenced formula of the patient stopped short. Unable to speak, the monster made wild motions with his arms until they too were arrested. When the awful name of Yog-Sothoth was uttered, the hideous change began. It was not merely a dissolution, but rather a transformation or recapitulation; and Willett shut his eyes lest he faint before the rest of the incantation could be pronounced.      But he did not faint, and that man of unholy centuries and forbidden secrets never troubled the world again. The madness out of time had subsided, and the case of Charles Dexter Ward was closed. Opening his eyes before staggering out of that room of horror, Dr. Willett saw that what he had kept in memory had not been kept amiss. There had, as he had predicted, been no need for acids. For like his accursed picture a year before, Joseph Curwen now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust.", "VIII.In the meantime a quieter yet even more spiritually poignant phase of the horror had been blackly unwinding itself behind the closed door of a shelf-lined room in Arkham. The curious manuscript record or diary of Wilbur Whateley, delivered to Miskatonic University for translation, had caused much worry and bafflement among the experts in languages both ancient and modern; its very alphabet, notwithstanding a general resemblance to the heavily shaded Arabic used in Mesopotamia, being absolutely unknown to any available authority. The final conclusion of the linguists was that the text represented an artificial alphabet, giving the effect of a cipher; though none of the usual methods of cryptographic solution seemed to furnish any clue, even when applied on the basis of every tongue the writer might conceivably have used. The ancient books taken from Whateley’s quarters, while absorbingly interesting and in several cases promising to open up new and terrible lines of research among philosophers and men of science, were of no assistance whatever in this matter. One of them, a heavy tome with an iron clasp, was in another unknown alphabet—this one of a very different cast, and resembling Sanscrit more than anything else. The old ledger was at length given wholly into the charge of Dr. Armitage, both because of his peculiar interest in the Whateley matter, and because of his wide linguistic learning and skill in the mystical formulae of antiquity and the Middle Ages.      Armitage had an idea that the alphabet might be something esoterically used by certain forbidden cults which have come down from old times, and which have inherited many forms and traditions from the wizards of the Saracenic world. That question, however, he did not deem vital; since it would be unnecessary to know the origin of the symbols if, as he suspected, they were used as a cipher in a modern language. It was his belief that, considering the great amount of text involved, the writer would scarcely have wished the trouble of using another speech than his own, save perhaps in certain special formulae and incantations. Accordingly he attacked the manuscript with the preliminary assumption that the bulk of it was in English.      Dr. Armitage knew, from the repeated failures of his colleagues, that the riddle was a deep and complex one; and that no simple mode of solution could merit even a trial. All through late August he fortified himself with the massed lore of cryptography; drawing upon the fullest resources of his own library, and wading night after night amidst the arcana of Trithemius’ Poligraphia, Giambattista Porta’s De Furtivis Literarum Notis, De Vigenère’s Traité des Chiffres, Falconer’s Cryptomenysis Patefacta, Davys’ and Thicknesse’s eighteenth-century treatises, and such fairly modern authorities as Blair, von Marten, and Klüber’s Kryptographik. He interspersed his study of the books with attacks on the manuscript itself, and in time became convinced that he had to deal with one of those subtlest and most ingenious of cryptograms, in which many separate lists of corresponding letters are arranged like the multiplication table, and the message built up with arbitrary key-words known only to the initiated. The older authorities seemed rather more helpful than the newer ones, and Armitage concluded that the code of the manuscript was one of great antiquity, no doubt handed down through a long line of mystical experimenters. Several times he seemed near daylight, only to be set back by some unforeseen obstacle. Then, as September approached, the clouds began to clear. Certain letters, as used in certain parts of the manuscript, emerged definitely and unmistakably; and it became obvious that the text was indeed in English.      On the evening of September 2nd the last major barrier gave way, and Dr. Armitage read for the first time a continuous passage of Wilbur Whateley’s annals. It was in truth a diary, as all had thought; and it was couched in a style clearly shewing the mixed occult erudition and general illiteracy of the strange being who wrote it. Almost the first long passage that Armitage deciphered, an entry dated November 26, 1916, proved highly startling and disquieting. It was written, he remembered, by a child of three and a half who looked like a lad of twelve or thirteen.      “Today learned the Aklo for the Sabaoth,” it ran, “which did not like, it being answerable from the hill and not from the air. That upstairs more ahead of me than I had thought it would be, and is not like to have much earth brain. Shot Elam Hutchins’ collie Jack when he went to bite me, and Elam says he would kill me if he dast. I guess he won’t. Grandfather kept me saying the Dho formula last night, and I think I saw the inner city at the 2 magnetic poles. I shall go to those poles when the earth is cleared off, if I can’t break through with the Dho-Hna formula when I commit it. They from the air told me at Sabbat that it will be years before I can clear off the earth, and I guess grandfather will be dead then, so I shall have to learn all the angles of the planes and all the formulas between the Yr and the Nhhngr. They from outside will help, but they cannot take body without human blood. That upstairs looks it will have the right cast. I can see it a little when I make the Voorish sign or blow the powder of Ibn Ghazi at it, and it is near like them at May-Eve on the Hill. The other face may wear off some. I wonder how I shall look when the earth is cleared and there are no earth beings on it. He that came with the Aklo Sabaoth said I may be transfigured, there being much of outside to work on.”      Morning found Dr. Armitage in a cold sweat of terror and a frenzy of wakeful concentration. He had not left the manuscript all night, but sat at his table under the electric light turning page after page with shaking hands as fast as he could decipher the cryptic text. He had nervously telephoned his wife he would not be home, and when she brought him a breakfast from the house he could scarcely dispose of a mouthful. All that day he read on, now and then halted maddeningly as a reapplication of the complex key became necessary. Lunch and dinner were brought him, but he ate only the smallest fraction of either. Toward the middle of the next night he drowsed off in his chair, but soon woke out of a tangle of nightmares almost as hideous as the truths and menaces to man’s existence that he had uncovered.      On the morning of September 4th Professor Rice and Dr. Morgan insisted on seeing him for a while, and departed trembling and ashen-grey. That evening he went to bed, but slept only fitfully. Wednesday—the next day—he was back at the manuscript, and began to take copious notes both from the current sections and from those he had already deciphered. In the small hours of that night he slept a little in an easy-chair in his office, but was at the manuscript again before dawn. Some time before noon his physician, Dr. Hartwell, called to see him and insisted that he cease work. He refused; intimating that it was of the most vital importance for him to complete the reading of the diary, and promising an explanation in due course of time.      That evening, just as twilight fell, he finished his terrible perusal and sank back exhausted. His wife, bringing his dinner, found him in a half-comatose state; but he was conscious enough to warn her off with a sharp cry when he saw her eyes wander toward the notes he had taken. Weakly rising, he gathered up the scribbled papers and sealed them all in a great envelope, which he immediately placed in his inside coat pocket. He had sufficient strength to get home, but was so clearly in need of medical aid that Dr. Hartwell was summoned at once. As the doctor put him to bed he could only mutter over and over again, “But what, in God’s name, can we do?”      Dr. Armitage slept, but was partly delirious the next day. He made no explanations to Hartwell, but in his calmer moments spoke of the imperative need of a long conference with Rice and Morgan. His wilder wanderings were very startling indeed, including frantic appeals that something in a boarded-up farmhouse be destroyed, and fantastic references to some plan for the extirpation of the entire human race and all animal and vegetable life from the earth by some terrible elder race of beings from another dimension. He would shout that the world was in danger, since the Elder Things wished to strip it and drag it away from the solar system and cosmos of matter into some other plane or phase of entity from which it had once fallen, vigintillions of aeons ago. At other times he would call for the dreaded Necronomicon and the Daemonolatreia of Remigius, in which he seemed hopeful of finding some formula to check the peril he conjured up.      “Stop them, stop them!” he would shout. “Those Whateleys meant to let them in, and the worst of all is left! Tell Rice and Morgan we must do something—it’s a blind business, but I know how to make the powder. . . . It hasn’t been fed since the second of August, when Wilbur came here to his death, and at that rate. . . .”      But Armitage had a sound physique despite his seventy-three years, and slept off his disorder that night without developing any real fever. He woke late Friday, clear of head, though sober with a gnawing fear and tremendous sense of responsibility. Saturday afternoon he felt able to go over to the library and summon Rice and Morgan for a conference, and the rest of that day and evening the three men tortured their brains in the wildest speculation and the most desperate debate. Strange and terrible books were drawn voluminously from the stack shelves and from secure places of storage; and diagrams and formulae were copied with feverish haste and in bewildering abundance. Of scepticism there was none. All three had seen the body of Wilbur Whateley as it lay on the floor in a room of that very building, and after that not one of them could feel even slightly inclined to treat the diary as a madman’s raving.      Opinions were divided as to notifying the Massachusetts State Police, and the negative finally won. There were things involved which simply could not be believed by those who had not seen a sample, as indeed was made clear during certain subsequent investigations. Late at night the conference disbanded without having developed a definite plan, but all day Sunday Armitage was busy comparing formulae and mixing chemicals obtained from the college laboratory. The more he reflected on the hellish diary, the more he was inclined to doubt the efficacy of any material agent in stamping out the entity which Wilbur Whateley had left behind him—the earth-threatening entity which, unknown to him, was to burst forth in a few hours and become the memorable Dunwich horror.      Monday was a repetition of Sunday with Dr. Armitage, for the task in hand required an infinity of research and experiment. Further consultations of the monstrous diary brought about various changes of plan, and he knew that even in the end a large amount of uncertainty must remain. By Tuesday he had a definite line of action mapped out, and believed he would try a trip to Dunwich within a week. Then, on Wednesday, the great shock came. Tucked obscurely away in a corner of the Arkham Advertiser was a facetious little item from the Associated Press, telling what a record-breaking monster the bootleg whiskey of Dunwich had raised up. Armitage, half stunned, could only telephone for Rice and Morgan. Far into the night they discussed, and the next day was a whirlwind of preparation on the part of them all. Armitage knew he would be meddling with terrible powers, yet saw that there was no other way to annul the deeper and more malign meddling which others had done before him."]}
{"id": "EN072", "pair": ["That is the end of the story, dear readers. Believe me or not, I dont care. I ran far away from the university that evening and, to this day, I have never returned. I had to have my arm amputated after that and my burned and mangled body remains as testament to the evil I have encountered. I told the authorities it was a college fire. What else could I say?I cannot sleep well anymore. Every night I lie awake, shaking in fear in the knowledge of what exists beyond the limited scope of what we call \"reality\". What is reality? I dont know. All I do know is that this world contains more evil than can ever be imagined.The evil of the Cult of Cthulhu is still out there and I know that my days are numbered. I have seen too much. One day they will come for me and, when they do, I will let them take me. I have tried to end my life a number of times and now reside in an asylum as a result. Death will come as a relief for me.It has taken me a great deal of effort to write this, since every fibre of my being has tried to block out the memories of what happened at that university. But I need you to know. I need you to be prepared. The Cult of Cthulhu is alive and well and, one day, Cthulhu will rise and destroy this planet. It is only a matter of time.Darkness.I didnt know who I was or where I was. All I could tell was that I was falling lower and lower into a deep oblivion of blackness.Though I was unafraid.Was I dead?It didnt matter.In that place, nothing mattered.I was at peace.And then I was jerked roughly back into reality, though reality had become so distorted in my mind that I could scarcely tell the difference between what was real and what was fantasy. The first thing that I became aware of was a searing pain across my abdomen. I tried to scream, but my throat was sore as though I had been screaming for hours already. I attempted to move my arms but they were locked in place and I realised to my horror that the pain was from ropes that had been tied around me so tightly that they were literally cutting into my flesh. I spluttered for a moment as the sights and sounds of the world started to come back to me. I was tied upside down to the obelisk in the centre of the ritual space I had seen the previous night and my worst fears were realised.I was covered in blood, though whether it was my own or that of another unfortunate victim I couldnt tell. A fire surrounded me and on the other side of the flames, people in black robes were dancing wildly making noises that sounded neither human nor beastly. I began to wonder why I was still alive and why I had not been dismembered like Jonathan.Then one of the participants stepped through the flames, emerging unharmed beside me. He brandished a long silver knife and screamed \"Cthulhu Fhtagn!\" at the heavens. The figure turned down to look at me. It was Jacob, though it wasnt Jacobs eyes that looked at me, rather an empty, soulless shell of a human being. He raised the knife and I began to pray silently, expecting the end. Though it wasnt me he plunged the knife into, it was himself. He rammed the blade up to the hilt into his stomach and violently jerked it upwards, sending gory sprays of arterial blood all over my face and into my mouth and nose. Jacob then reached into his chest and began to pull out his internal organs, laughing maniacally as he did so. It was then that I found my voice and screamed louder than I had ever done, though my cries were drowned out by the diabolical beat of the drums and the bestial chants of the other cultists.Jacob did not fall to the ground as anyone else would have done. Instead, he cracked open his ribcage, revealing his empty chest cavity. An unseen force then ripped his head back, nearly severing it, his spine bent backwards and cracked and then his limbs began bending into odd angles as well. All the while, he continued in his demonic laughter, the chants of the cultists and the beat of the drums growing and growing. He contorted spasmodically, and shadowy tendrils sprung out of his body, twisting as they reached up to the sky. Suddenly, Jacobs body exploded in a shower of blood and offal although his ghoulish laugh seemed to continue somehow, and out of nowhere appeared many small winged creatures. They were less than three feet in height and completely black. No detail of their bodies was visible save for a pair of glowing green eyes. They swooped around the obelisk to which I was tied, uttering a shrieking sound unlike anything I had ever heard. As they shrieked, the dancing, chanting and beating of the drums got louder and wilder until, at its climax, the ground itself started rumbling. Cracks started to appear in the ground and water started gushing out causing the obelisk to crumble, but the fire burned ever brighter.Due to the destruction of the obelisk, the bonds that were around my middle loosened slightly. But as I tried to rise, I was violently pushed down into the water by one of the cultists who cried,\"Mighty Cthulhu! Accept our sacrifice of blood and rise again!\" With that he drew a knife of his own, but before he was able to end my existence, one of the shadowy winged creatures flew into his chest, disappearing in an instant. Suddenly, the cultists eyes literally burst into flames and he began reciting the chant I had heard so many times: \"Cthulhu Fhtagn! Cthulhu Fhtagn!\" His mouth then opened wide and I could hear his jaw bone break. Long teeth extended from the gums and before I could react, he lurched forward sinking them into my forearm.This new pain was just what I needed. I screamed in agony and ripped free. Quickly loosening the bonds around me, I leapt through the fire. Its searing heat scorched me and I felt as though a thousand knives were simultaneously being plunged into my skin. I looked desperately around for an opening to escape and noticed that all the cultists now had flaming eyes and were running at me screaming even as their heads burned in the flames from their eyes. I turned and fled, not caring about the pain in my arm or the fire that was rapidly consuming me. Not caring about the thorns and branches that eviscerated me as I ran past them. I knew I just needed to get as far away as possible.Although the screams of the ritual participants had begun to fade, I did not slow down. I just kept going and did not look back.", "\"Great Cthulhu looks favorably upon your sacrifices.\" Torren-Wraeth swept his arms expansively before the congregation, \"And your faith pleases him greatly.\" He had been summoned, he hated being summoned, but it was his duty. \"What is your desire?\" A fire blazed on the stone alter behind him, and dark-robed humans knelt before the child of their god as a tentacular, vaguely toad-like being known colloquially as a \"Servitor of the Outer Gods\", (His personal name was Grix), piped away on a bone flute. The High Priest, distinguished by his rich green robes, stood, \"We seeketh only a small boon from thy sire.\" Torren-Wraeth rolled his eyes mentally, why did humans always use that annoying Archaic English in religious rights. Cthulhu didnt speak English, let alone Ye Olde English. \"What is it?\" The priest then began a short list of needs, more game to hunt, more rain for the crops, as if Cthulhu could magically make them appear. Well, he could make rain, at least, but not animals... Animal life had flourished since The Great Arising, with so few humans left to hunt them, these people had probably been careless, overtaxing their resources...\"Rain will not be a problem,\" Torren-Wraeth said confidently, then, \"But animals and good crops are more in the domain of Shub-Niggurath.\" Grix stopped piping and eyed Torren-Wraeth in surprise. The priest looked confused, the congregation certainly was. \"Canst thou not aid us?\" Torren-Wraeth considered for a moment, Cthulhu could drive animals toward this village, but could he make crops grow? \"He can send rain and more game animals for you to hunt, but as for the growing of crops, you will likely have to either trust your luck or make sacrifices to Cernunos.\" That avatar of Shub-Niggurath was closely associated with agriculture, and Cthulhu didnt mind sharing his worshipers. Torren-Wraeth knew of one god he didnt want the people to follow, however. \"And by The Key and The Gate dont start worshiping He-Who-Walks-Between-the-Rows!\" Lightning struck near the entrance of the church, fusing sand to glass, \"If you sacrifice to him, Ill kill you all myself!\" The congregation recoiled in terror. A steady rain began to fall outside the church. The congregation, forgetting their confusing, terrifying angel, and went wild. \"PRAISE CTHULHU!\" \"IA! IA! CTHULHU NAFLFHTAGN!\"Great Cthulhu held court from his green-black graven throne in the Temple of The Key and The Gate. Though many worshiped him as a god or feared him as a devil, the Lord of RLyeh was in truth a high priest of Yog-Sothoth. Not that he discouraged his own worship, even as his own clerics, Father Dagon and Mother Hydra, gladly accepted the worshipful adulation of the lesser races. There were plenty of eager and fearful acolytes for everyone.Later, after the humans had all driven or drunken themselves into noisy slumber, Grix rolled over to Torren-Wraeth, who sat cross-legged and disgusted on the cold stone floor. \"Your father may not be pleased that you shattered his image of omnipotence.\" \"Should I give these people lies?\" Torren-Wraeth spoke freely, no one there but the two of them understood Grix tongue. Grix laughed, a peculiar gurgling sound, \"Isnt it all a lie, in the end? You made it rain, not your father. I could have, too, if I had wanted.\" Torren-Wraeth sighed, not knowing how to respond, then took the pipe from Grix slimy tentacles and began to play.Torren-Wraeth had some friends and allies, human or otherwise. Tektaktequataquarl, a True-Blood Hastur-Spawn. An unlikely friend, certainly, as Hastur and Cthulhu were grave enemies, and Hasturs Spawn were no more given to emotion in any human standard than those of his nemesis. Tek was an exception, wild, emotional, maybe even a little bit crazy, even by the standards of The King in Tatters. He took human form, male, beautiful, gold skin and gleaming wings, though in truth he was a hermaphroditic golden mass of flesh, tendrils, eyes and mouths. As Hastur-Spawn, he was unwelcome in Cthulhus court, but he ignored the threats with the casual indifference of an immortal, perhaps he even found a perverse pleasure in visiting enemy territory. Besides, his mate, the Bloated Woman, also known as the Goddess of the Black Fan, lived in the mountains of China. Seven feet tall, six hundred pounds of blubber and writhing tendrils topped with five vicious mouths and a pair of exquisitely beautiful eyes. When holding the Black Fan under her eyes, she was slim and beautiful, a mask for luring men to a gruesome death. Ironically, Tek found the true form more appealing, a form so similar to his own... Regardless, Cthulhu would never dare move against her, for The Bloated Woman was an avatar of the only being Cthulhu truly feared, Nyarlathotep. To anger Nyarlathotep meant horrors even Great Cthulhu dare not imagine. Torren-Wraeth did not care much for the cruel Goddess, but, in some strange way, Tek loved her. Torren-Wraeth had no way of knowing if the feeling was reciprocated, one never knew with The Crawling Chaos...Then there were the Insects from Shaggai, who had dwelt in Englands Severn valley for centuries, repairing their temple-ship. They brought with them their experiences, their dreams and nightmares of far-off wonders; The cities of long-dead Shaggai, the titanic natives of Thuggon, of Lghhx, Xiclotl and Tond. They had finally escaped earth shortly before The Great Arising. They had been cruel and twisted beings, but living their mortal memories made Torren-Wraeth long to visit these worlds, where eyeless giants strode teeming marshes and suns blazed black in amber skies. He sometimes used his skills at bending space and reality to take brief jaunts to these worlds. But he always came back. He could not seem to break earths hold on him, the ties of birth and blood were too strong.In his house at RLyeh Torren-Wraeth slept poorly. His home, small by Cthuli standards, was the size of a cathedral, one large room with a stone bed covered by warm blankets and a square, shallow pool of flowing seawater that served as a bath. A low stone shelf held an image of Goro, preserved forever beneath unbreakable, transparent alien stone. Several books, scrolls and tablets lay scattered about, and the room, from floor to ceiling, was covered with elaborate carvings of alien worlds and incredible creatures. A grim looking Moai sat in a corner, looking out over the green-black structure. A small chest of amber-colored stone, strongly contrasting the general color scheme, held Torren-Wraeths clothing.He rose from his bed and walked across the cool floor to the open portal, staring out at the fickle stars that flickered in the night sky. Isnt it all a lie in the end? He sighed, then turned to the chest and began to dress.Ho Fong stood at the gates of the Monastery of The Bloated Woman, catching the first rays of sunlight. He was old, centuries had passed since he became high priest of The Order of The Bloated Woman, yet time held no power over him. He appeared to be in his early fifties, without even a gray hair. Someone, an American, no doubt, had once insultingly compared him to the fictional Chinese villain Fu Manchu. In truth, he did resemble a significantly heavier version of the Devil Doctor, complete with the signature moustache. Hed killed the man, of course. The Goddess required sacrifices, after all. As the golden light began to bath the magnificent mountains of China in divine splendor, he thought about The Other. He did not worship lord Tektaktequataquarl, as he didnt seem to desire worship, but was obliged to give him all due respect as the Goddess consort. Tek was coming, of course. The only constant in that being of chaos life was his love for the Goddess, a love Ho Fong envied, though he could never bring himself to admit it. He straightened his yellow and black silk robes, the official garb of the Order, and prepared to greet the Hastur-Spawn.The monastery was fairly new, The Order had once had centers in Shanghai and on Gray Dragon Island, but these had been lost in 1926. Enemies of The Order had overwhelmed and destroyed them. Much had been lost, and Ho Fong himself had nearly been killed. These had been powerful setbacks, but, in the end, they had been immaterial, as both Shanghai and Gray Dragon Island now lay lost beneath the waves. Ho Fongs enemies, The Goddess enemies, were all long dead. He walked back into the monastery, passing lesser monks and acolytes who bowed dutifully toward him, and approached the great bronze doors behind which the Goddess rested. Two burly monks opened the doors and Ho Fong respectfully approached the screens of yellow and black silk that lay beyond the carven jade sacrificial alter.The Bloated Woman sat upon a pile of silken cushions, smoking essence of Black Lotus from an ornate hookah, its pipe in her third mouth. The Black Fan and six sacred golden sickles, used to dispatch human sacrifices, hung from a black silk sash wrapped around her prodigious belly. The priest bowed deeply to his beloved Goddess. \"He will not be here for some time yet.\" The Goddess voice was smooth and sultry. \"Receive him warmly.\" She blew fragrantly scented smoke from her fourth mouth, whilst speaking through her second and first.Tektaktequataquarl flapped his gleaming wings in the bright morning sun. He felt Torren-Wraeths approach long before he could see him. He was a good kid, level-headed and thoughtful, the total opposite of Tek himself. Perhaps that was why he liked him, a balance of chaos and order. Yin and Yang, so to speak. Ever since his human confidant had died, the Half-Blood had become more sullen and withdrawn. He needed more excitement in his life. Perhaps Tek himself needed less, courting an avatar of Nyarlathotep. Even Hastur had expressed concern about that union, but love is blind. She was evil, in human terms, but, then again, by human terms she was hideous. He found her beautiful and dangerous. He wondered what their coming offspring would be like...He suddenly realized something had changed. Torren-Wraeth was in trouble, his life was in danger. He turned back and sped toward the Half-Blood..."]}
{"id": "EN022", "pair": ["V. A Nightmare and a Cataclysm1.And now swiftly followed that hideous experience which has left its indelible mark of fear on the soul of Marinus Bicknell Willett, and has added a decade to the visible age of one whose youth was even then far behind. Dr. Willett had conferred at length with Mr. Ward, and had come to an agreement with him on several points which both felt the alienists would ridicule. There was, they conceded, a terrible movement alive in the world, whose direct connexion with a necromancy even older than the Salem witchcraft could not be doubted. That at least two living men - and one other of whom they dared not think - were in absolute possession of minds or personalities which had functioned as early as 1690 or before was likewise almost unassailably proved even in the face of all known natural laws. What these horrible creatures - and Charles Ward as well - were doing or trying to do seemed fairly clear from their letters and from every bit of light both old and new which had filtered in upon the case. They were robbing the tombs of all the ages, including those of the worlds wisest and greatest men, in the hope of recovering from the bygone ashes some vestige of the consciousness and lore which had once animated and informed them.      A hideous traffick was going on among these nightmare ghouls, whereby illustrious bones were bartered with the calm calculativeness of schoolboys swapping books; and from what was extorted from this centuried dust there was anticipated a power and a wisdom beyond anything which the cosmos had ever seen concentrated in one man or group. They had found unholy ways to keep their brains alive, either in the same body or different bodies; and had evidently achieved a way of tapping the consciousness of the dead whom they gathered together. There had, it seems, been some truth in chimerical old Borellus when he wrote of preparing from even the most antique remains certain \"Essential Saltes\" from which the shade of a long-dead living thing might be raised up. There was a formula for evoking such a shade, and another for putting it down; and it had now been so perfected that it could be taught successfully. One must be careful about evocations, for the markers of old graves are not always accurate.      Willett and Mr. Ward shivered as they passed from conclusion to conclusion. Things - presences or voices of some sort - could be drawn down from unknown places as well as from the grave, and in this process also one must be careful. Joseph Curwen had indubitably evoked many forbidden things, and as for Charles - what might one think of him? What forces \"outside the spheres\" had reached him from Joseph Curwens day and turned his mind on forgotten things? He had been led to find certain directions, and he had used them. He had talked with the man of horror in Prague and stayed long with the creature in the mountains of Transylvania. And he must have found the grave of Joseph Curwen at last. That newspaper item and what his mother had heard in the night were too significant to overlook. Then he had summoned something, and it must have come. That mighty voice aloft on Good Friday, and those different tones in the locked attic laboratory. What were they like, with their depth and hollowness? Was there not here some awful foreshadowing of the dreaded stranger Dr. Allen with his spectral bass? Yes, that was what Mr. Ward had felt with vague horror in his single talk with the man - if man it were - over the telephone!      What hellish consciousness or voice, what morbid shade or presence, had come to answer Charles Wards secret rites behind that locked door? Those voices heard in argument - \"must have it red for three months\" - Good God! Was not that just before the vampirism broke out? The rifling of Ezra Weedens ancient grave, and the cries later at Pawtuxet - whose mind had planned the vengeance and rediscovered the shunned seat of elder blasphemies? And then the bungalow and the bearded stranger, and the gossip, and the fear. The final madness of Charles neither father nor doctor could attempt to explain, but they did feel sure that the mind of Joseph Curwen had come to earth again and was following its ancient morbidities. Was daemoniac possession in truth a possibility? Allen had something to do with it, and the detectives must find out more about one whose existence menaced the young mans life. In the meantime, since the existence of some vast crypt beneath the bungalow seemed virtually beyond dispute, some effort must be made to find it. Willett and Mr. Ward, conscious of the sceptical attitude of the alienists, resolved during their final conference to undertake a joint secret exploration of unparalleled thoroughness; and agreed to meet at the bungalow on the following morning with valises and with certain tools and accessories suited to architectural search and underground exploration.      The morning of April 6th dawned clear, and both explorers were at the bungalow by ten oclock. Mr. Ward had the key, and an entry and cursory survey were made. From the disordered condition of Dr. Allens room it was obvious that the detectives had been there before, and the later searchers hoped that they had found some clue which might prove of value. Of course the main business lay in the cellar; so thither they descended without much delay, again making the circuit which each had vainly made before in the presence of the mad young owner. For a time everything seemed baffling, each inch of the earthen floor and stone walls having so solid and innocuous an aspect that the thought of a yawning aperture was scarcely to be entertained. Willett reflected that since the original cellar was dug without knowledge of any catacombs beneath, the beginning of the passage would represent the strictly modern delving of young Ward and his associates, where they had probed for the ancient vaults whose rumour could have reached them by no wholesome means.      The doctor tried to put himself in Charless place to see how a delver would be likely to start, but could not gain much inspiration from this method. Then he decided on elimination as a policy, and went carefully over the whole subterranean surface both vertical and horizontal, trying to account for every inch separately. He was soon substantially narrowed down, and at last had nothing left but the small platform before the washtubs, which he had tried once before in vain. Now experimenting in every possible way, and exerting a double strength, he finally found that the top did indeed turn and slide horizontally on a corner pivot. Beneath it lay a trim concrete surface with an iron manhole, to which Mr. Ward at once rushed with excited zeal. The cover was not hard to lift, and the father had quite removed it when Willett noticed the queerness of his aspect. He was swaying and nodding dizzily, and in the gust of noxious air which swept up from the black pit beneath the doctor soon recognised ample cause.      In a moment Dr. Willett had his fainting companion on the floor above and was reviving him with cold water. Mr. Ward responded feebly, but it could be seen that the mephitic blast from the crypt had in some way gravely sickened him. Wishing to take no chances, Willett hastened out to Broad Street for a taxicab and had soon dispatched the sufferer home despite his weak-voiced protests; after which he produced an electric torch, covered his nostrils with a band of sterile gauze, and descended once more to peer into the new-found depths. The foul air had now slightly abated, and Willett was able to send a beam of light down the Stygian hole. For about ten feet, he saw, it was a sheer cylindrical drop with concrete walls and an iron ladder; after which the hole appeared to strike a flight of old stone steps which must originally have emerged to earth somewhat southwest of the present building.2.      Willett freely admits that for a moment the memory of the old Curwen legends kept him from climbing down alone into that malodorous gulf. He could not help thinking of what Luke Fenner had reported on that last monstrous night. Then duty asserted itself and he made the plunge, carrying a great valise for the removal of whatever papers might prove of supreme importance. Slowly, as befitted one of his years, he descended the ladder and reached the slimy steps below. This was ancient masonry, his torch told him; and upon the dripping walls he saw the unwholesome moss of centuries. Down, down, ran the steps; not spirally, but in three abrupt turns; and with such narrowness that two men could have passed only with difficulty. He had counted about thirty when a sound reached him very faintly; and after that he did not feel disposed to count any more.      It was a godless sound; one of those low-keyed, insidious outrages of Nature which are not meant to be. To call it a dull wail, a doom-dragged whine, or a hopeless howl of chorused anguish and stricken flesh without mind would be to miss its most quintessential loathsomeness and soul-sickening overtones. Was it for this that Ward had seemed to listen on that day he was removed? It was the most shocking thing that Willett had ever heard, and it continued from no determinate point as the doctor reached the bottom of the steps and cast his torchlight around on lofty corridor walls surmounted by Cyclopean vaulting and pierced by numberless black archways. The hall in which he stood was perhaps fourteen feet high to the middle of the vaulting and ten or twelve feet broad. Its pavement was of large chipped flagstones, and its walls and roof were of dressed masonry. Its length he could not imagine, for it stretched ahead indefinitely into the blackness. Of the archways, some had doors of the old six-panelled colonial type, whilst others had none.      Overcoming the dread induced by the smell and the howling, Willett began to explore these archways one by one; finding beyond them rooms with groined stone ceilings, each of medium size and apparently of bizarre uses. Most of them had fireplaces, the upper courses of whose chimneys would have formed an interesting study in engineering. Never before or since had he seen such instruments or suggestions of instruments as here loomed up on every hand through the burying dust and cobwebs of a century and a half, in many cases evidently shattered as if by the ancient raiders. For many of the chambers seemed wholly untrodden by modern feet, and must have represented the earliest and most obsolete phases of Joseph Curwens experimentation. Finally there came a room of obvious modernity, or at least of recent occupancy. There were oil heaters, bookshelves and tables, chairs and cabinets, and a desk piled high with papers of varying antiquity and contemporaneousness. Candlesticks and oil lamps stood about in several places; and finding a match-safe handy, Willett lighted such as were ready for use.      In the fuller gleam it appeared that this apartment was nothing less than the latest study or library of Charles Ward. Of the books the doctor had seen many before, and a good part of the furniture had plainly come from the Prospect Street mansion. Here and there was a piece well known to Willett, and the sense of familiarity became so great that he half forgot the noisomeness and the wailing, both of which were plainer here than they had been at the foot of the steps. His first duty, as planned long ahead, was to find and seize any papers which might seem of vital importance; especially those portentous documents found by Charles so long ago behind the picture in Olney Court. As he searched he perceived how stupendous a task the final unravelling would be; for file on file was stuffed with papers in curious hands and bearing curious designs, so that months or even years might be needed for a thorough deciphering and editing. Once he found large packets of letters with Prague and Rakus postmarks, and in writing clearly recognisable as Ornes and Hutchinsons; all of which he took with him as part of the bundle to be removed in his valise.      At last, in a locked mahogany cabinet once gracing the Ward home, Willett found the batch of old Curwen papers; recognising them from the reluctant glimpse Charles had granted him so many years ago. The youth had evidently kept them together very much as they had been when first he found them, since all the titles recalled by the workmen were present except the papers addressed to Orne and Hutchinson, and the cipher with its key. Willett placed the entire lot in his valise and continued his examination of the files. Since young Wards immediate condition was the greatest matter at stake, the closest searching was done among the most obviously recent matter; and in this abundance of contemporary manuscript one very baffling oddity was noted. The oddity was the slight amount in Charless normal writing, which indeed included nothing more recent than two months before. On the other hand, there were literally reams of symbols and formulae, historical notes and philosophical comment, in a crabbed penmanship absolutely identical with the ancient script of Joseph Curwen, though of undeniably modern dating. Plainly, a part of the latter-day programme had been a sedulous imitation of the old wizards writing, which Charles seemed to have carried to a marvellous state of perfection. Of any third hand which might have been Allens there was not a trace. If he had indeed come to be the leader, he must have forced young Ward to act as his amanuensis.      In this new material one mystic formula, or rather pair of formulae, recurred so often that Willett had it by heart before he had half finished his quest. It consisted of two parallel columns, the left-hand one surmounted by the archaic symbol called \"Dragons Head\" and used in almanacks to indicate the ascending node, and the right-hand one headed by a corresponding sign of \"Dragons Tail\" or descending node. The appearance of the whole was something like this, and almost unconsciously the doctor realised that the second half was no more than the first written syllabically backward with the exception of the final monosyllables and of the odd name Yog-Sothoth, which he had come to recognise under various spellings from other things he had seen in connexion with this horrible matter. The formulae were as follows - exactly so, as Willett is abundantly able to testify - and the first one struck an odd note of uncomfortable latent memory in his brain, which he recognised later when reviewing the events of that horrible Good Friday of the previous year.YAI NGNGAH,YOG-SOTHOTHHEE - LGEBFAI THRODOGUAAAH      \tOGTHROD AIFGEBL - EEHYOG-SOTHOTHNGAHNG AIYZHROSo haunting were these formulae, and so frequently did he come upon them, that before the doctor knew it he was repeating them under his breath. Eventually, however, he felt he had secured all the papers he could digest to advantage for the present; hence resolved to examine no more till he could bring the sceptical alienists en masse for an ampler and more systematic raid. He had still to find the hidden laboratory, so leaving his valise in the lighted room he emerged again into the black noisome corridor whose vaulting echoed ceaselessly with that dull and hideous whine.      The next few rooms he tried were all abandoned, or filled only with crumbling boxes and ominous-looking leaden coffins; but impressed him deeply with the magnitude of Joseph Curwens original operations. He thought of the slaves and seamen who had disappeared, of the graves which had been violated in every part of the world, and of what that final raiding party must have seen; and then he decided it was better not to think any more. Once a great stone staircase mounted at his right, and he deduced that this must have reached to one of the Curwen outbuildings - perhaps the famous stone edifice with the high slit-like windows - provided the steps he had descended had led from the steep-roofed farmhouse. Suddenly the walls seemed to fall away ahead, and the stench and the wailing grew stronger. Willett saw that he had come upon a vast open space, so great that his torchlight would not carry across it; and as he advanced he encountered occasional stout pillars supporting the arches of the roof.      After a time he reached a circle of pillars grouped like the monoliths of Stonehenge, with a large carved altar on a base of three steps in the centre; and so curious were the carvings on that altar that he approached to study them with his electric light. But when he saw what they were he shrank away shuddering, and did not stop to investigate the dark stains which discoloured the upper surface and had spread down the sides in occasional thin lines. Instead, he found the distant wall and traced it as it swept round in a gigantic circle perforated by occasional black doorways and indented by a myriad of shallow cells with iron gratings and wrist and ankle bonds on chains fastened to the stone of the concave rear masonry. These cells were empty, but still the horrible odour and the dismal moaning continued, more insistent now than ever, and seemingly varied at times by a sort of slippery thumping.3.      From that frightful smell and that uncanny noise Willetts attention could no longer be diverted. Both were plainer and more hideous in the great pillared hall than anywhere else, and carried a vague impression of being far below, even in this dark nether world of subterrene mystery. Before trying any of the black archways for steps leading further down, the doctor cast his beam of light about the stone-flagged floor. It was very loosely paved, and at irregular intervals there would occur a slab curiously pierced by small holes in no definite arrangement, while at one point there lay a very long ladder carelessly flung down. To this ladder, singularly enough, appeared to cling a particularly large amount of the frightful odour which encompassed everything. As he walked slowly about it suddenly occurred to Willett that both the noise and the odour seemed strongest directly above the oddly pierced slabs, as if they might be crude trap-doors leading down to some still deeper region of horror. Kneeling by one, he worked at it with his hands, and found that with extreme difficulty he could budge it. At his touch the moaning beneath ascended to a louder key, and only with vast trepidation did he persevere in the lifting of the heavy stone. A stench unnamable now rose up from below, and the doctors head reeled dizzily as he laid back the slab and turned his torch upon the exposed square yard of gaping blackness.      If he had expected a flight of steps to some wide gulf of ultimate abomination, Willett was destined to be disappointed; for amidst that foetor and cracked whining he discerned only the brick-faced top of a cylindrical well perhaps a yard and a half in diameter and devoid of any ladder or other means of descent. As the light shone down, the wailing changed suddenly to a series of horrible yelps; in conjunction with which there came again that sound of blind, futile scrambling and slippery thumping. The explorer trembled, unwilling even to imagine what noxious thing might be lurking in that abyss, but in a moment mustered up the courage to peer over the rough-hewn brink; lying at full length and holding the torch downward at arms length to see what might lie below. For a second he could distinguish nothing but the slimy, moss-grown brick walls sinking illimitably into that half-tangible miasma of murk and foulness and anguished frenzy; and then he saw that something dark was leaping clumsily and frantically up and down at the bottom of the narrow shaft, which must have been from twenty to twenty-five feet below the stone floor where he lay. The torch shook in his hand, but he looked again to see what manner of living creature might be immured there in the darkness of that unnatural well; left starving by young Ward through all the long month since the doctors had taken him away, and clearly only one of a vast number prisoned in the kindred wells whose pierced stone covers so thickly studded in the floor of the great vaulted cavern. Whatever the things were, they could not lie down in their cramped spaces; but must have crouched and whined and waited and feebly leaped all those hideous weeks since their master had abandoned them unheeded.      But Marinus Bicknell Willett was sorry that he looked again; for surgeon and veteran of the dissecting-room though he was, he has not been the same since. It is hard to explain just how a single sight of a tangible object with measureable dimensions could so shake and change a man; and we may only say that there is about certain outlines and entities a power of symbolism and suggestion which acts frightfully on a sensitive thinkers perspective and whispers terrible hints of obscure cosmic relationships and unnamable realities behind the protective illusions of common vision. In that second look Willett saw such an outline or entity, for during the next few instants he was undoubtedly as stark mad as any inmate of Dr. Waites private hospital. He dropped the electric torch from a hand drained of muscular power or nervous cordination, nor heeded the sound of crunching teeth which told of its fate at the bottom of the pit. He screamed and screamed and screamed in a voice whose falsetto panic no acquaintance of his would ever have recognised; and though he could not rise to his feet he crawled and rolled desperately away over the damp pavement where dozens of Tartarean wells poured forth their exhausted whining and yelping to answer his own insane cries. He tore his hands on the rough, loose stones, and many times bruised his head against the frequent pillars, but still he kept on. Then at last he slowly came to himself in the utter blackness and stench, and stopped his ears against the droning wail into which the burst of yelping had subsided. He was drenched with perspiration and without means of producing a light; stricken and unnerved in the abysmal blackness and horror, and crushed with a memory he never could efface. Beneath him dozens of those things still lived, and from one of the shafts the cover was removed. He knew that what he had seen could never climb up the slippery walls, yet shuddered at the thought that some obscure foot-hold might exist.      What the thing was, he would never tell. It was like some of the carvings on the hellish altar, but it was alive. Nature had never made it in this form, for it was too palpably unfinished. The deficiencies were of the most surprising sort, and the abnormalities of proportion could not be described. Willett consents only to say that this type of thing must have represented entities which Ward called up from imperfect salts, and which he kept for servile or ritualistic purposes. If it had not had a certain significance, its image would not have been carved on that damnable stone. It was not the worst thing depicted on that stone - but Willett never opened the other pits. At the time, the first connected idea in his mind was an idle paragraph from some of the old Curwen data he had digested long before; a phrase used by Simon or Jedediah Orne in that portentous confiscated letter to the bygone sorcerer: \"Certainely, there was Nothg butt ye liveliest Awfulness in that which H. raisd upp from What he coud gather onlie a part of.\"      Then, horribly supplementing rather than displacing this image, there came a recollection of those ancient lingering rumours anent the burned, twisted thing found in the fields a week after the Curwen raid. Charles Ward had once told the doctor what old Slocum said of that object; that it was neither thoroughly human, nor wholly allied to any animal which Pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about.      These words hummed in the doctors mind as he rocked to and fro, squatting on the nitrous stone floor. He tried to drive them out, and repeated the Lords Prayer to himself; eventually trailing off into a mnemonic hodge-podge like the modernistic Waste Land of Mr. T. S. Eliot and finally reverting to the oft-repeated dual formula he had lately found in Wards underground library: \"Yai ngngah, Yog-Sothoth\", and so on till the final underlined \"Zhro\". It seemed to soothe him, and he staggered to his feet after a time; lamenting bitterly his fright-lost torch and looking wildly about for any gleam of light in the clutching inkiness of the chilly air. Think he would not; but he strained his eyes in every direction for some faint glint or reflection of the bright illumination he had left in the library. After a while he thought he detected a suspicion of a glow infinitely far away, and toward this he crawled in agonised caution on hands and knees amidst the stench and howling, always feeling ahead lest he collide with the numerous great pillars or stumble into the abominable pit he had uncovered.      Once his shaking fingers touched something which he knew must be the steps leading to the hellish altar, and from this spot he recoiled in loathing. At another time he encountered the pierced slab he had removed, and here his caution became almost pitiful. But he did not come upon the dread aperture after all, nor did anything issue from that aperture to detain him. What had been down there made no sound nor stir. Evidently its crunching of the fallen electric torch had not been good for it. Each time Willetts fingers felt a perforated slab he trembled. His passage over it would sometimes increase the groaning below, but generally it would produce no effect at all, since he moved very noiselessly. Several times during his progress the glow ahead diminished perceptibly, and he realised that the various candles and lamps he had left must be expiring one by one. The thought of being lost in utter darkness without matches amidst this underground world of nightmare labyrinths impelled him to rise to his feet and run, which he could safely do now that he had passed the open pit; for he knew that once the light failed, his only hope of rescue and survival would lie in whatever relief party Mr. Ward might send after missing him for a sufficient period. Presently, however, he emerged from the open space into the narrower corridor and definitely located the glow as coming from a door on his right. In a moment he had reached it and was standing once more in young Wards secret library, trembling with relief, and watching the sputterings of that last lamp which had brought him to safety.4.      In another moment he was hastily filling the burned-out lamps from an oil supply he had previously noticed, and when the room was bright again he looked about to see if he might find a lantern for further exploration. For racked though he was with horror, his sense of grim purpose was still uppermost; and he was firmly determined to leave no stone unturned in his search for the hideous facts behind Charles Wards bizarre madness. Failing to find a lantern, he chose the smallest of the lamps to carry; also filling his pockets with candles and matches, and taking with him a gallon can of oil, which he proposed to keep for reserve use in whatever hidden laboratory he might uncover beyond the terrible open space with its unclean altar and nameless covered wells. To traverse that space again would require his utmost fortitude, but he knew it must be done. Fortunately neither the frightful altar nor the opened shaft was near the vast cell-indented wall which bounded the cavern area, and whose black mysterious archways would form the next goals of a logical search.      So Willett went back to that great pillared hall of stench and anguished howling; turning down his lamp to avoid any distant glimpse of the hellish altar, or of the uncovered pit with the pierced stone slab beside it. Most of the black doorways led merely to small chambers, some vacant and some evidently used as storerooms; and in several of the latter he saw some very curious accumulations of various objects. One was packed with rotting and dust-draped bales of spare clothing, and the explorer thrilled when he saw that it was unmistakably the clothing of a century and a half before. In another room he found numerous odds and ends of modern clothing, as if gradual provisions were being made to equip a large body of men. But what he disliked most of all were the huge copper vats which occasionally appeared; these, and the sinister incrustations upon them. He liked them even less than the weirdly figured leaden bowls whose rims retained such obnoxious deposits and around which clung repellent odours perceptible above even the general noisomeness of the crypt. When he had completed about half the entire circuit of the wall he found another corridor like that from which he had come, and out of which many doors opened. This he proceeded to investigate; and after entering three rooms of medium size and of no significant contents, he came at last to a large oblong apartment whose business-like tanks and tables, furnaces and modern instruments, occasional books and endless shelves of jars and bottles proclaimed it indeed the long-sought laboratory of Charles Ward - and no doubt of old Joseph Curwen before him.      After lighting the three lamps which he found filled and ready, Dr. Willett examined the place and all its appurtenances with the keenest interest; noting from the relative quantities of various reagents on the shelves that young Wards dominant concern must have been with some branch of organic chemistry. On the whole, little could be learned from the scientific ensemble, which included a gruesome-looking dissecting table; so that the room was really rather a disappointment. Among the books was a tattered old copy of Borellus in black-letter, and it was weirdly interesting to note that Ward had underlined the same passage whose marking had so perturbed good Mr. Merritt at Curwens farmhouse more than a century and a half before. That older copy, of course, must have perished along with the rest of Curwens occult library in the final raid. Three archways opened off the laboratory, and these the doctor proceeded to sample in turn. From his cursory survey he saw that two led merely to small storerooms; but these he canvassed with care, remarking the piles of coffins in various stages of damage and shuddering violently at two or three of the few coffin-plates he could decipher. There was much clothing also stored in these rooms, and several new and tightly nailed boxes which he did not stop to investigate. Most interesting of all, perhaps, were some odd bits which he judged to be fragments of old Joseph Curwens laboratory appliances. These had suffered damage at the hands of the raiders, but were still partly recognisable as the chemical paraphernalia of the Georgian period.      The third archway led to a very sizeable chamber entirely lined with shelves and having in the centre a table bearing two lamps. These lamps Willett lighted, and in their brilliant glow studied the endless shelving which surrounded him. Some of the upper levels were wholly vacant, but most of the space was filled with small odd-looking leaden jars of two general types; one tall and without handles like a Grecian lekythos or oil-jug, and the other with a single handle and proportioned like a Phaleron jug. All had metal stoppers, and were covered with peculiar-looking symbols moulded in low relief. In a moment the doctor noticed that these jugs were classified with great rigidity; all the lekythoi being on one side of the room with a large wooden sign reading \"Custodes\" above them, and all the Phalerons on the other, correspondingly labelled with a sign reading \"Materia\". Each of the jars or jugs, except some on the upper shelves that turned out to be vacant, bore a cardboard tag with a number apparently referring to a catalogue; and Willett resolved to look for the latter presently. For the moment, however, he was more interested in the nature of the array as a whole; and experimentally opened several of the lekythoi and Phalerons at random with a view to a rough generalisation. The result was invariable. Both types of jar contained a small quantity of a single kind of substance; a fine dusty powder of very light weight and of many shades of dull, neutral colour. To the colours which formed the only point of variation there was no apparent method of disposal; and no distinction between what occurred in the lekythoi and what occurred in the Phalerons. A bluish-grey powder might be by the side of a pinkish-white one, and any one in a Phaleron might have its exact counterpart in a lekythos. The most individual feature about the powders was their non-adhesiveness. Willett would pour one into his hand, and upon returning it to its jug would find that no residue whatever remained on its palm.      The meaning of the two signs puzzled him, and he wondered why this battery of chemicals was separated so radically from those in glass jars on the shelves of the laboratory proper. \"Custodes\", \"Materia\"; that was the Latin for \"Guards\" and \"Materials\", respectively - and then there came a flash of memory as to where he had seen that word \"Guards\" before in connexion with this dreadful mystery. It was, of course, in the recent letter to Dr. Allen purporting to be from old Edward Hutchinson; and the phrase had read: \"There was no Neede to keep the Guards in Shape and eatg off their Heads, and it made Much to be founde in Case of Trouble, as you too welle knowe.\" What did this signify? But wait - was there not still another reference to \"guards\" in this matter which he had failed wholly to recall when reading the Hutchinson letter? Back in the old non-secretive days Ward had told him of the Eleazar Smith diary recording the spying of Smith and Weeden on the Curwen farm, and in that dreadful chronicle there had been a mention of conversations overheard before the old wizard betook himself wholly beneath the earth. There had been, Smith and Weeden insisted, terrible colloquies wherein figured Curwen, certain captives of his, and the guards of those captives. Those guards, according to Hutchinson or his avatar, had eaten their heads off, so that now Dr. Allen did not keep them in shape. And if not in shape, how save as the \"salts\" to which it appears this wizard band was engaged in reducing as many human bodies or skeletons as they could?      So that was what these lekythoi contained; the monstrous fruit of unhallowed rites and deeds, presumably won or cowed to such submission as to help, when called up by some hellish incantation, in the defence of their blasphemous master or the questioning of those who were not so willing? Willett shuddered at the thought of what he had been pouring in and out of his hands, and for a moment felt an impulse to flee in panic from that cavern of hideous shelves with their silent and perhaps watching sentinels. Then he thought of the \"Materia\" - in the myriad Phaleron jugs on the other side of the room. Salts too - and if not the salts of \"guards\", then the salts of what? God! Could it be possible that here lay the mortal relics of half the titan thinkers of all the ages; snatched by supreme ghouls from crypts where the world thought them safe, and subject to the beck and call of madmen who sought to drain their knowledge for some still wilder end whose ultimate effect would concern, as poor Charles had hinted in his frantic note, all civilisation, all natural law, perhaps even the fate of the solar system and the universe? And Marinus Bicknell Willett had sifted their dust through his hands!      Then he noticed a small door at the farther end of the room, and calmed himself enough to approach it and examine the crude sign chiselled above. It was only a symbol, but it filled him with vague spiritual dread; for a morbid, dreaming friend of his had once drawn it on paper and told him a few of the things it means in the dark abyss of sleep. It was the sign of Koth, that dreamers see fixed above the archway of a certain black tower standing alone in twilight - and Willett did not like what his friend Randolph Carter had said of its powers. But a moment later he forgot the sign as he recognised a new acrid odour in the stench-filled air. This was a chemical rather than animal smell, and came clearly from the room beyond the door. And it was, unmistakably, the same odour which had saturated Charles Wards clothing on the day the doctors had taken him away. So it was here that the youth had been interrupted by the final summons? He was wiser than old Joseph Curwen, for he had not resisted. Willett, boldly determined to penetrate every wonder and nightmare this nether realm might contain, seized the small lamp and crossed the threshold. A wave of nameless fright rolled out to meet him, but he yielded to no whim and deferred to no intuition. There was nothing alive here to harm him, and he would not be stayed in his piercing of the eldritch cloud which engulfed his patient.      The room beyond the door was of medium size, and had no furniture save a table, a single chair, and two groups of curious machines with clamps and wheels, which Willett recognised after a moment as mediaeval instruments of torture. On one side of the door stood a rack of savage whips, above which were some shelves bearing empty rows of shallow pedestalled cups of lead shaped like Grecian kylikes. On the other side was the table; with a powerful Argand lamp, a pad and pencil, and two of the stoppered lekythoi from the shelves outside set down at irregular places as if temporarily or in haste. Willett lighted the lamp and looked carefully at the pad, to see what notes young Ward might have been jotting down when interrupted; but found nothing more intelligible than the following disjointed fragments in that crabbed Curwen chirography, which shed no light on the case as a whole:\"B. dyd not. Escapd into walls and founde Place below.\"Saw olde V. saye ye Sabaoth and learnt ye Way.\"Raisd Yog-Sothoth thrice and was ye nexte Day deliverd.\"F. soughte to wipe out all knowg howe to raise Those from Outside.\"      As the strong Argand blaze lit up the entire chamber the doctor saw that the wall opposite the door, between the two groups of torturing appliances in the corners, was covered with pegs from which hung a set of shapeless-looking robes of a rather dismal yellowish-white. But far more interesting were the two vacant walls, both of which were thickly covered with mystic symbols and formulae roughly chiselled in the smooth dressed stone. The damp floor also bore marks of carving; and with but little difficulty Willett deciphered a huge pentagram in the centre, with a plain circle about three feet wide half way between this and each corner. In one of these four circles, near where a yellowish robe had been flung carelessly down, there stood a shallow kylix of the sort found on the shelves above the whip-rack; and just outside the periphery was one of the Phaleron jugs from the shelves in the other room, its tag numbered 118. This was unstoppered, and proved upon inspection to be empty; but the explorer saw with a shiver that the kylix was not. Within its shallow area, and saved from scattering only by the absence of wind in this sequestered cavern, lay a small amount of a dry, dull-greenish efflorescent powder which must have belonged in the jug; and Willett almost reeled at the implications that came sweeping over him as he correlated little by little the several elements and antecedents of the scene. The whips and the instruments of torture, the dust or salts from the jug of \"Materia\", the two lekythoi from the \"Custodes\" shelf, the robes, the formulae on the walls, the notes on the pad, the hints from letters and legends, and the thousand glimpses, doubts, and suppositions which had come to torment the friends and parents of Charles Ward - all these engulfed the doctor in a tidal wave of horror as he looked at that dry greenish powder outspread in the pedestalled leaden kylix on the floor.      With an effort, however, Willett pulled himself together and began studying the formulae chiselled on the walls. From the stained and incrusted letters it was obvious that they were carved in Joseph Curwens time, and their text was such as to be vaguely familiar to one who had read much Curwen material or delved extensively into the history of magic. One the doctor clearly recognised as what Mrs. Ward heard her son chanting on that ominous Good Friday a year before, and what an authority had told him was a very terrible invocation addressed to secret gods outside the normal spheres. It was not spelled here exactly as Mrs. Ward had set it down from memory, nor yet as the authority had shewn it to him in the forbidden pages of \"Eliphas Levi\"; but its identity was unmistakable, and such words as Sabaoth, Metraton, Almousin, and Zariatnatmik sent a shudder of fright through the searcher who had seen and felt so much of cosmic abomination just around the corner.      This was on the left-hand wall as one entered the room. The right-hand wall was no less thickly inscribed, and Willett felt a start of recognition as he came upon the pair of formulae so frequently occurring in the recent notes in the library. They were, roughly speaking, the same; with the ancient symbols of \"Dragons Head\" and \"Dragons Tail\" heading them as in Wards scribblings. But the spelling differed quite widely from that of the modern versions, as if old Curwen had had a different way of recording sound, or as if later study had evolved more powerful and perfected variants of the invocations in question. The doctor tried to reconcile the chiselled version with the one which still ran persistently in his head, and found it hard to do. Where the script he had memorised began \"Yai ngngah, Yog-Sothoth\", this epigraph started out as \"Aye, engengah, Yogge-Sothotha\"; which to his mind would seriously interfere with the syllabification of the second word.      Ground as the later text was into his consciousness, the discrepancy disturbed him; and he found himself chanting the first of the formulae aloud in an effort to square the sound he conceived with the letters he found carved. Weird and menacing in that abyss of antique blasphemy rang his voice; its accents keyed to a droning sing-song either through the spell of the past and the unknown, or through the hellish example of that dull, godless wail from the pits whose inhuman cadences rose and fell rhythmically in the distance through the stench and the darkness.\"YAI NGNGAH,YOG-SOTHOTHHEE - LGEBFAI THRODOGUAAAH!\"      But what was this cold wind which had sprung into life at the very outset of the chant? The lamps were sputtering woefully, and the gloom grew so dense that the letters on the wall nearly faded from sight. There was smoke, too, and an acrid odour which quite drowned out the stench from the far-away wells; an odour like that he had smelt before, yet infinitely stronger and more pungent. He turned from the inscriptions to face the room with its bizarre contents, and saw that the kylix on the floor, in which the ominous efflorescent powder had lain, was giving forth a cloud of thick, greenish-black vapour of surprising volume and opacity. That powder - Great God! it had come from the shelf of \"Materia\" - what was it doing now, and what had started it? The formula he had been chanting - the first of the pair - Dragons Head, ascending node - Blessed Saviour, could it be. . . .      The doctor reeled, and through his head raced wildly disjointed scraps from all he had seen, heard, and read of the frightful case of Joseph Curwen and Charles Dexter Ward. \"I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe. . . . Have ye Wordes for laying at all times readie, and stopp not to be sure when there is any Doubte of Whom you have. . . . Three Talkes with What was therein inhumd. . . .\" Mercy of Heaven, what is that shape behind the parting smoke?5.      Marinus Bicknell Willett has no hope that any part of his tale will be believed except by certain sympathetic friends, hence he has made no attempt to tell it beyond his most intimate circle. Only a few outsiders have ever heard it repeated, and of these the majority laugh and remark that the doctor surely is getting old. He has been advised to take a long vacation and to shun future cases dealing with mental disturbance. But Mr. Ward knows that the veteran physician speaks only a horrible truth. Did not he himself see the noisome aperture in the bungalow cellar? Did not Willett send him home overcome and ill at eleven oclock that portentous morning? Did he not telephone the doctor in vain that evening, and again the next day, and had he not driven to the bungalow itself on that following noon, finding his friend unconscious but unharmed on one of the beds upstairs? Willett had been breathing stertorously, and opened his eyes slowly when Mr. Ward gave him some brandy fetched from the car. Then he shuddered and screamed, crying out, \"That beard . . . those eyes. . . . God, who are you?\" A very strange thing to say to a trim, blue-eyed, clean-shaven gentleman whom he had known from the latters boyhood.      In the bright noon sunlight the bungalow was unchanged since the previous morning. Willetts clothing bore no disarrangement beyond certain smudges and worn places at the knees, and only a faint acrid odour reminded Mr. Ward of what he had smelt on his son that day he was taken to the hospital. The doctors flashlight was missing, but his valise was safely there, as empty as when he had brought it. Before indulging in any explanations, and obviously with great moral effort, Willett staggered dizzily down to the cellar and tried the fateful platform before the tubs. It was unyielding. Crossing to where he had left his yet unused tool satchel the day before, he obtained a chisel and began to pry up the stubborn planks one by one. Underneath the smooth concrete was still visible, but of any opening or perforation there was no longer a trace. Nothing yawned this time to sicken the mystified father who had followed the doctor downstairs; only the smooth concrete underneath the planks - no noisome well, no world of subterrene horrors, no secret library, no Curwen papers, no nightmare pits of stench and howling, no laboratory or shelves or chiselled formulae, no. . . . Dr. Willett turned pale, and clutched at the younger man. \"Yesterday,\" he asked softly, \"did you see it here . . . and smell it?\" And when Mr. Ward, himself transfixed with dread and wonder, found strength to nod an affirmative, the physician gave a sound half a sigh and half a gasp, and nodded in turn. \"Then I will tell you,\" he said.      So for an hour, in the sunniest room they could find upstairs, the physician whispered his frightful tale to the wondering father. There was nothing to relate beyond the looming up of that form when the greenish-black vapour from the kylix parted, and Willett was too tired to ask himself what had really occurred. There were futile, bewildered head-shakings from both men, and once Mr. Ward ventured a hushed suggestion, \"Do you suppose it would be of any use to dig?\" The doctor was silent, for it seemed hardly fitting for any human brain to answer when powers of unknown spheres had so vitally encroached on this side of the Great Abyss. Again Mr. Ward asked, \"But where did it go? It brought you here, you know, and it sealed up the hole somehow.\" And Willett again let silence answer for him.      But after all, this was not the final phase of the matter. Reaching for his handkerchief before rising to leave, Dr. Willetts fingers closed upon a piece of paper in his pocket which had not been there before, and which was companioned by the candles and matches he had seized in the vanished vault. It was a common sheet, torn obviously from the cheap pad in that fabulous room of horror somewhere underground, and the writing upon it was that of an ordinary lead pencil - doubtless the one which had lain beside the pad. It was folded very carelessly, and beyond the faint acrid scent of the cryptic chamber bore no print or mark of any world but this. But in the text itself it did indeed reek with wonder; for here was no script of any wholesome age, but the laboured strokes of mediaeval darkness, scarcely legible to the laymen who now strained over it, yet having combinations of symbols which seemed vaguely familiar. The briefly scrawled message was this, and its mystery lent purpose to the shaken pair, who forthwith walked steadily out to the Ward car and gave orders to be driven first to a quiet dining place and then to the John Hay Library on the hill.      At the library it was easy to find good manuals of palaeography, and over these the two men puzzled till the lights of evening shone out from the great chandelier. In the end they found what was needed. The letters were indeed no fantastic invention, but the normal script of a very dark period. They were the pointed Saxon minuscules of the eighth or ninth century A.D., and brought with them memories of an uncouth time when under a fresh Christian veneer ancient faiths and ancient rites stirred stealthily, and the pale moon of Britain looked sometimes on strange deeds in the Roman ruins of Caerleon and Hexham, and by the towers along Hadrians crumbling wall. The words were in such Latin as a barbarous age might remember - \"Corvinus necandus est. Cadaver aq(ua) forti dissolvendum, nec aliq(ui)d retinendum. Tace ut potes.\" - which may roughly be translated, \"Curwen must be killed. The body must be dissolved in aqua fortis, nor must anything be retained. Keep silence as best you are able.\"      Willett and Mr. Ward were mute and baffled. They had met the unknown, and found that they lacked emotions to respond to it as they vaguely believed they ought. With Willett, especially, the capacity for receiving fresh impressions of awe was well-nigh exhausted; and both men sat still and helpless till the closing of the library forced them to leave. Then they drove listlessly to the Ward mansion in Prospect Street, and talked to no purpose into the night. The doctor rested toward morning, but did not go home. And he was still there Sunday noon when a telephone message came from the detectives who had been assigned to look up Dr. Allen.      Mr. Ward, who was pacing nervously about in a dressing-gown, answered the call in person; and told the men to come up early the next day when he heard their report was almost ready. Both Willett and he were glad that this phase of the matter was taking form, for whatever the origin of the strange minuscule message, it seemed certain that the \"Curwen\" who must be destroyed could be no other than the bearded and spectacled stranger. Charles had feared this man, and had said in the frantic note that he must be killed and dissolved in acid. Allen, moreover, had been receiving letters from the strange wizards in Europe under the name of Curwen, and palpably regarded himself as an avatar of the bygone necromancer. And now from a fresh and unknown source had come a message saying that \"Curwen\" must be killed and dissolved in acid. The linkage was too unmistakable to be factitious; and besides, was not Allen planning to murder young Ward upon the advice of the creature called Hutchinson? Of course, the letter they had seen had never reached the bearded stranger; but from its text they could see that Allen had already formed plans for dealing with the youth if he grew too squeamish. Without doubt, Allen must be apprehended; and even if the most drastic directions were not carried out, he must be placed where he could inflict no harm upon Charles Ward.      That afternoon, hoping against hope to extract some gleam of information anent the inmost mysteries from the only available one capable of giving it, the father and the doctor went down the bay and called on young Charles at the hospital. Simply and gravely Willett told him all he had found, and noticed how pale he turned as each description made certain the truth of the discovery. The physician employed as much dramatic effect as he could, and watched for a wincing on Charless part when he approached the matter of the covered pits and the nameless hybrids within. But Ward did not wince. Willett paused, and his voice grew indignant as he spoke of how the things were starving. He taxed the youth with shocking inhumanity, and shivered when only a sardonic laugh came in reply. For Charles, having dropped as useless his pretence that the crypt did not exist, seemed to see some ghastly jest in this affair; and chuckled hoarsely at something which amused him. Then he whispered, in accents doubly terrible because of the cracked voice he used, \"Damn em, they do eat, but they dont need to! Thats the rare part! A month, you say, without food? Lud, Sir, you be modest! Dye know, that was the joke on poor old Whipple with his virtuous bluster! Kill everything off, would he? Why, damme, he was half-deaf with the noise from Outside and never saw or heard aught from the wells! He never dreamed they were there at all! Devil take ye, those cursed things have been howling down there ever since Curwen was done for a hundred and fifty-seven years gone!\"      But no more than this could Willett get from the youth. Horrified, yet almost convinced against his will, he went on with his tale in the hope that some incident might startle his auditor out of the mad composure he maintained. Looking at the youths face, the doctor could not but feel a kind of terror at the changes which recent months had wrought. Truly, the boy had drawn down nameless horrors from the skies. When the room with the formulae and the greenish dust was mentioned, Charles shewed his first sign of animation. A quizzical look overspread his face as he heard what Willett had read on the pad, and he ventured the mild statement that those notes were old ones, of no possible significance to anyone not deeply initiated in the history of magic. \"But,\" he added, \"had you but known the words to bring up that which I had out in the cup, you had not been here to tell me this. Twas Number 118, and I conceive you would have shook had you looked it up in my list in tother room. Twas never raised by me, but I meant to have it up that day you came to invite me hither.\"      Then Willett told of the formula he had spoken and of the greenish-black smoke which had arisen; and as he did so he saw true fear dawn for the first time on Charles Wards face. \"It came, and you be here alive?\" As Ward croaked the words his voice seemed almost to burst free of its trammels and sink to cavernous abysses of uncanny resonance. Willett, gifted with a flash of inspiration, believed he saw the situation, and wove into his reply a caution from a letter he remembered. \"No. 118, you say? But dont forget that stones are all changed now in nine grounds out of ten. You are never sure till you question!\" And then, without warning, he drew forth the minuscule message and flashed it before the patients eyes. He could have wished no stronger result, for Charles Ward fainted forthwith.      All this conversation, of course, had been conducted with the greatest secrecy lest the resident alienists accuse the father and the physician of encouraging a madman in his delusions. Unaided, too, Dr. Willett and Mr. Ward picked up the stricken youth and placed him on the couch. In reviving, the patient mumbled many times of some word which he must get to Orne and Hutchinson at once; so when his consciousness seemed fully back the doctor told him that of those strange creatures at least one was his bitter enemy, and had given Dr. Allen advice for his assassination. This revelation produced no visible effect, and before it was made the visitors could see that their host had already the look of a hunted man. After that he would converse no more, so Willett and the father departed presently; leaving behind a caution against the bearded Allen, to which the youth only replied that this individual was very safely taken care of, and could do no one any harm even if he wished. This was said with an almost evil chuckle very painful to hear. They did not worry about any communications Charles might indite to that monstrous pair in Europe, since they knew that the hospital authorities seized all outgoing mail for censorship and would pass no wild or outr-looking missive.      There is, however, a curious sequel to the matter of Orne and Hutchinson, if such indeed the exiled wizards were. Moved by some vague presentiment amidst the horrors of that period, Willett arranged with an international press-cutting bureau for accounts of notable current crimes and accidents in Prague and in eastern Transylvania; and after six months believed that he had found two very significant things amongst the multifarious items he received and had translated. One was the total wrecking of a house by night in the oldest quarter of Prague, and the disappearance of the evil old man called Josef Nadek, who had dwelt in it alone ever since anyone could remember. The other was a titan explosion in the Transylvanian mountains east of Rakus, and the utter extirpation with all its inmates of the ill-regarded Castle Ferenczy, whose master was so badly spoken of by peasants and soldiery alike that he would shortly have been summoned to Bucharest for serious questioning had not this incident cut off a career already so long as to antedate all common memory. Willett maintains that the hand which wrote those minuscules was able to wield stronger weapons as well; and that while Curwen was left to him to dispose of, the writer felt able to find and deal with Orne and Hutchinson itself. Of what their fate may have been the doctor strives sedulously not to think.6.      The following morning Dr. Willett hastened to the Ward home to be present when the detectives arrived. Allens destruction or imprisonment - or Curwens, if one might regard the tacit claim to reincarnation as valid - he felt must be accomplished at any cost, and he communicated this conviction to Mr. Ward as they sat waiting for the men to come. They were downstairs this time, for the upper parts of the house were beginning to be shunned because of a peculiar nauseousness which hung indefinitely about; a nauseousness which the older servants connected with some curse left by the vanished Curwen portrait.      At nine oclock the three detectives presented themselves and immediately delivered all that they had to say. They had not, regrettably enough, located the Brava Tony Gomes as they had wished, nor had they found the least trace of Dr. Allens source or present whereabouts; but they had managed to unearth a considerable number of local impressions and facts concerning the reticent stranger. Allen had struck Pawtuxet people as a vaguely unnatural being, and there was an universal belief that his thick sandy beard was either dyed or false - a belief conclusively upheld by the finding of such a false beard, together with a pair of dark glasses, in his room at the fateful bungalow. His voice, Mr. Ward could well testify from his one telephone conversation, had a depth and hollowness that could not be forgotten; and his glance seemed malign even through his smoked and horn-rimmed glasses. One shopkeeper, in the course of negotiations, had seen a specimen of his handwriting and declared it was very queer and crabbed; this being confirmed by pencilled notes of no clear meaning found in his room and identified by the merchant. In connexion with the vampirism rumours of the preceding summer, a majority of the gossips believed that Allen rather than Ward was the actual vampire. Statements were also obtained from the officials who had visited the bungalow after the unpleasant incident of the motor truck robbery. They had felt less of the sinister in Dr. Allen, but had recognised him as the dominant figure in the queer shadowy cottage. The place had been too dark for them to observe him clearly, but they would know him again if they saw him. His beard had looked odd, and they thought he had some slight scar above his dark spectacled right eye. As for the detectives search of Allens room, it yielded nothing definite save the beard and glasses, and several pencilled notes in a crabbed writing which Willett at once saw was identical with that shared by the old Curwen manuscripts and by the voluminous recent notes of young Ward found in the vanished catacombs of horror.      Dr. Willett and Mr. Ward caught something of a profound, subtle, and insidious cosmic fear from this data as it was gradually unfolded, and almost trembled in following up the vague, mad thought which had simultaneously reached their minds. The false beard and glasses - the crabbed Curwen penmanship - the old portrait and its tiny scar - and the altered youth in the hospital with such a scar - that deep, hollow voice on the telephone - was it not of this that Mr. Ward was reminded when his son barked forth those pitiable tones to which he now claimed to be reduced? Who had ever seen Charles and Allen together? Yes, the officials had once, but who later on? Was it not when Allen left that Charles suddenly lost his growing fright and began to live wholly at the bungalow? Curwen - Allen - Ward - in what blasphemous and abominable fusion had two ages and two persons become involved? That damnable resemblance of the picture to Charles - had it not used to stare and stare, and follow the boy around the room with its eyes? Why, too, did both Allen and Charles copy Joseph Curwens handwriting, even when alone and off guard? And then the frightful work of those people - the lost crypt of horrors that had aged the doctor overnight; the starved monsters in the noisome pits; the awful formula which had yielded such nameless results; the message in minuscules found in Willetts pocket; the papers and the letters and all the talk of graves and \"salts\" and discoveries - whither did everything lead? In the end Mr. Ward did the most sensible thing. Steeling himself against any realisation of why he did it, he gave the detectives an article to be shewn to such Pawtuxet shopkeepers as had seen the portentous Dr. Allen. That article was a photograph of his luckless son, on which he now carefully drew in ink the pair of heavy glasses and the black pointed beard which the men had brought from Allens room.      For two hours he waited with the doctor in the oppressive house where fear and miasma were slowly gathering as the empty panel in the upstairs library leered and leered and leered. Then the men returned. Yes. The altered photograph was a very passable likeness of Dr. Allen. Mr. Ward turned pale, and Willett wiped a suddenly dampened brow with his handkerchief. Allen - Ward - Curwen - it was becoming too hideous for coherent thought. What had the boy called out of the void, and what had it done to him? What, really, had happened from first to last? Who was this Allen who sought to kill Charles as too squeamish, and why had his destined victim said in the postscript to that frantic letter that he must be so completely obliterated in acid? Why, too, had the minuscule message, of whose origin no one dared think, said that \"Curwen\" must be likewise obliterated? What was the change, and when had the final stage occurred? That day when his frantic note was received - he had been nervous all the morning, then there was an alteration. He had slipped out unseen and swaggered boldly in past the men hired to guard him. That was the time, when he was out. But no - had he not cried out in terror as he entered his study - this very room? What had he found there? Or wait - what had found him? That simulacrum which brushed boldly in without having been seen to go - was that an alien shadow and a horror forcing itself upon a trembling figure which had never gone out at all? Had not the butler spoken of queer noises?      Willett rang for the man and asked him some low-toned questions. It had, surely enough, been a bad business. There had been noises - a cry, a gasp, a choking, and a sort of clattering or creaking or thumping, or all of these. And Mr. Charles was not the same when he stalked out without a word. The butler shivered as he spoke, and sniffed at the heavy air that blew down from some open window upstairs. Terror had settled definitely upon the house, and only the business-like detectives failed to imbibe a full measure of it. Even they were restless, for this case had held vague elements in the background which pleased them not at all. Dr. Willett was thinking deeply and rapidly, and his thoughts were terrible ones. Now and then he would almost break into muttering as he ran over in his head a new, appalling, and increasingly conclusive chain of nightmare happenings.      Then Mr. Ward made a sign that the conference was over, and everyone save him and the doctor left the room. It was noon now, but shadows as of coming night seemed to engulf the phantom-haunted mansion. Willett began talking very seriously to his host, and urged that he leave a great deal of the future investigation to him. There would be, he predicted, certain obnoxious elements which a friend could bear better than a relative. As family physician he must have a free hand, and the first thing he required was a period alone and undisturbed in the abandoned library upstairs, where the ancient overmantel had gathered about itself an aura of noisome horror more intense than when Joseph Curwens features themselves glanced slyly down from the painted panel.      Mr. Ward, dazed by the flood of grotesque morbidities and unthinkably maddening suggestions that poured in upon him from every side, could only acquiesce; and half an hour later the doctor was locked in the shunned room with the panelling from Olney Court. The father, listening outside, heard fumbling sounds of moving and rummaging as the moments passed; and finally a wrench and a creak, as if a tight cupboard door were being opened. Then there was a muffled cry, a kind of snorting choke, and a hasty slamming of whatever had been opened. Almost at once the key rattled and Willett appeared in the hall, haggard and ghastly, and demanding wood for the real fireplace on the south wall of the room. The furnace was not enough, he said; and the electric log had little practical use. Longing yet not daring to ask questions, Mr. Ward gave the requisite orders and a man brought some stout pine logs, shuddering as he entered the tainted air of the library to place them in the grate. Willett meanwhile had gone up to the dismantled laboratory and brought down a few odds and ends not included in the moving of the July before. They were in a covered basket, and Mr. Ward never saw what they were.      Then the doctor locked himself in the library once more, and by the clouds of smoke which rolled down past the windows from the chimney it was known that he had lighted the fire. Later, after a great rustling of newspapers, that odd wrench and creaking were heard again; followed by a thumping which none of the eavesdroppers liked. Thereafter two suppressed cries of Willetts were heard, and hard upon these came a swishing rustle of indefinable hatefulness. Finally the smoke that the wind beat down from the chimney grew very dark and acrid, and everyone wished that the weather had spared them this choking and venomous inundation of peculiar fumes. Mr. Wards head reeled, and the servants all clustered together in a knot to watch the horrible black smoke swoop down. After an age of waiting the vapours seemed to lighten, and half-formless sounds of scraping, sweeping, and other minor operations were heard behind the bolted door. And at last, after the slamming of some cupboard within, Willett made his appearance - sad, pale, and haggard, and bearing the cloth-draped basket he had taken from the upstairs laboratory. He had left the window open, and into that once accursed room was pouring a wealth of pure, wholesome air to mix with a queer new smell of disinfectants. The ancient overmantel still lingered; but it seemed robbed of malignity now, and rose as calm and stately in its white panelling as if it had never borne the picture of Joseph Curwen. Night was coming on, yet this time its shadows held no latent fright, but only a gentle melancholy. Of what he had done the doctor would never speak. To Mr. Ward he said, \"I can answer no questions, but I will say that there are different kinds of magic. I have made a great purgation, and those in this house will sleep the better for it.\"7.      That Dr. Willetts \"purgation\" had been an ordeal almost as nerve-racking in its way as his hideous wandering in the vanished crypt is shewn by the fact that the elderly physician gave out completely as soon as he reached home that evening. For three days he rested constantly in his room, though servants later muttered something about having heard him after midnight on Wednesday, when the outer door softly opened and closed with phenomenal softness. Servants imaginations, fortunately, are limited, else comment might have been excited by an item in Thursdays Evening Bulletin which ran as follows:North End GhoulsActive AgainAfter a lull of ten months since the dastardly vandalism in the Weeden lot at the North Burial Ground, a nocturnal prowler was glimpsed early this morning in the same cemetery by Robert Hart, the night watchman. Happening to glance for a moment from his shelter at about 2 a.m., Hart observed the glow of a lantern or pocket torch not far to the northwest, and upon opening the door detected the figure of a man with a trowel very plainly silhouetted against a nearby electric light. At once starting in pursuit, he saw the figure dart hurriedly toward the main entrance, gaining the street and losing himself among the shadows before approach or capture was possible.      Like the first of the ghouls active during the past year, this intruder had done no real damage before detection. A vacant part of the Ward lot shewed signs of a little superficial digging, but nothing even nearly the size of a grave had been attempted, and no previous grave had been disturbed.      Hart, who cannot describe the prowler except as a small man probably having a full beard, inclines to the view that all three of the digging incidents have a common source; but police from the Second Station think otherwise on account of the savage nature of the second incident, where an ancient coffin was removed and its headstone violently shattered.      The first of the incidents, in which it is thought an attempt to bury something was frustrated, occurred a year ago last March, and has been attributed to bootleggers seeking a cache. It is possible, says Sergt. Riley, that this third affair is of similar nature. Officers at the Second Station are taking especial pains to capture the gang of miscreants responsible for these repeated outrages.      All day Thursday Dr. Willett rested as if recuperating from something past or nerving himself for something to come. In the evening he wrote a note to Mr. Ward, which was delivered the next morning and which caused the half-dazed parent to ponder long and deeply. Mr. Ward had not been able to go down to business since the shock of Monday with its baffling reports and its sinister \"purgation\", but he found something calming about the doctors letter in spite of the despair it seemed to promise and the fresh mysteries it seemed to evoke.\"10 Barnes St.,            Providence, R.I.,      April 12, 1928.\"Dear Theodore: - I feel that I must say a word to you before doing what I am going to do tomorrow. It will conclude the terrible business we have been going through (for I feel that no spade is ever likely to reach that monstrous place we know of), but Im afraid it wont set your mind at rest unless I expressly assure you how very conclusive it is.      \"You have known me ever since you were a small boy, so I think you will not distrust me when I hint that some matters are best left undecided and unexplored. It is better that you attempt no further speculation as to Charless case, and almost imperative that you tell his mother nothing more than she already suspects. When I call on you tomorrow Charles will have escaped. That is all which need remain in anyones mind. He was mad, and he escaped. You can tell his mother gently and gradually about the mad part when you stop sending the typed notes in his name. Id advise you to join her in Atlantic City and take a rest yourself. God knows you need one after this shock, as I do myself. I am going South for a while to calm down and brace up.      \"So dont ask me any questions when I call. It may be that something will go wrong, but Ill tell you if it does. I dont think it will. There will be nothing more to worry about, for Charles will be very, very safe. He is now - safer than you dream. You need hold no fears about Allen, and who or what he is. He forms as much a part of the past as Joseph Curwens picture, and when I ring your doorbell you may feel certain that there is no such person. And what wrote that minuscule message will never trouble you or yours.      \"But you must steel yourself to melancholy, and prepare your wife to do the same. I must tell you frankly that Charless escape will not mean his restoration to you. He has been afflicted with a peculiar disease, as you must realise from the subtle physical as well as mental changes in him, and you must not hope to see him again. Have only this consolation - that he was never a fiend or even truly a madman, but only an eager, studious, and curious boy whose love of mystery and of the past was his undoing. He stumbled on things no mortal ought ever to know, and reached back through the years as no one ever should reach; and something came out of those years to engulf him.      \"And now comes the matter in which I must ask you to trust me most of all. For there will be, indeed, no uncertainty about Charless fate. In about a year, say, you can if you wish devise a suitable account of the end; for the boy will be no more. You can put up a stone in your lot at the North Burial Ground exactly ten feet west of your fathers and facing the same way, and that will mark the true resting-place of your son. Nor need you fear that it will mark any abnormality or changeling. The ashes in that grave will be those of your own unaltered bone and sinew - of the real Charles Dexter Ward whose mind you watched from infancy - the real Charles with the olive-mark on his hip and without the black witch-mark on his chest or the pit on his forehead. The Charles who never did actual evil, and who will have paid with his life for his squeamishness.      \"That is all. Charles will have escaped, and a year from now you can put up his stone. Do not question me tomorrow. And believe that the honour of your ancient family remains untainted now, as it has been at all times in the past.      \"With profoundest sympathy, and exhortations to fortitude, calmness, and resignation, I am everSincerely your friend,      Marinus B. Willett\"      So on the morning of Friday, April 13, 1928, Marinus Bicknell Willett visited the room of Charles Dexter Ward at Dr. Waites private hospital on Conanicut Island. The youth, though making no attempt to evade his caller, was in a sullen mood; and seemed disinclined to open the conversation which Willett obviously desired. The doctors discovery of the crypt and his monstrous experience therein had of course created a new source of embarrassment, so that both hesitated perceptibly after the interchange of a few strained formalities. Then a new element of constraint crept in, as Ward seemed to read behind the doctors mask-like face a terrible purpose which had never been there before. The patient quailed, conscious that since the last visit there had been a change whereby the solicitous family physician had given place to the ruthless and implacable avenger.      Ward actually turned pale, and the doctor was the first to speak. \"More,\" he said, \"has been found out, and I must warn you fairly that a reckoning is due.\"      \"Digging again, and coming upon more poor starving pets?\" was the ironic reply. It was evident that the youth meant to shew bravado to the last.      \"No,\" Willett slowly rejoined, \"this time I did not have to dig. We have had men looking up Dr. Allen, and they found the false beard and spectacles in the bungalow.\"      \"Excellent,\" commented the disquieted host in an effort to be wittily insulting, \"and I trust they proved more becoming than the beard and glasses you now have on!\"      \"They would become you very well,\" came the even and studied response, \"as indeed they seem to have done.\"      As Willett said this, it almost seemed as though a cloud passed over the sun; though there was no change in the shadows on the floor. Then Ward ventured:      \"And is this what asks so hotly for a reckoning? Suppose a man does find it now and then useful to be twofold?\"      \"No,\" said Willett gravely, \"again you are wrong. It is no business of mine if any man seeks duality; provided he has any right to exist at all, and provided he does not destroy what called him out of space.\"      Ward now started violently. \"Well, Sir, what have ye found, and what dye want with me?\"      The doctor let a little time elapse before replying, as if choosing his words for an effective answer.      \"I have found,\" he finally intoned, \"something in a cupboard behind an ancient overmantel where a picture once was, and I have burned it and buried the ashes where the grave of Charles Dexter Ward ought to be.\"      The madman choked and sprang from the chair in which he had been sitting:      \"Damn ye, who did ye tell - and wholl believe it was he after these full two months, with me alive? What dye mean to do?\"      Willett, though a small man, actually took on a kind of judicial majesty as he calmed the patient with a gesture.      \"I have told no one. This is no common case - it is a madness out of time and a horror from beyond the spheres which no police or lawyers or courts or alienists could ever fathom or grapple with. Thank God some chance has left inside me the spark of imagination, that I might not go astray in thinking out this thing. You cannot deceive me, Joseph Curwen, for I know that your accursed magic is true!      \"I know how you wove the spell that brooded outside the years and fastened on your double and descendant; I know how you drew him into the past and got him to raise you up from your detestable grave; I know how he kept you hidden in his laboratory while you studied modern things and roved abroad as a vampire by night, and how you later shewed yourself in beard and glasses that no one might wonder at your godless likeness to him; I know what you resolved to do when he balked at your monstrous rifling of the worlds tombs, and at what you planned afterward, and I know how you did it.      \"You left off your beard and glasses and fooled the guards around the house. They thought it was he who went in, and they thought it was he who came out when you had strangled and hidden him. But you hadnt reckoned on the different contents of two minds. You were a fool, Curwen, to fancy that a mere visual identity would be enough. Why didnt you think of the speech and the voice and the handwriting? It hasnt worked, you see, after all. You know better than I who or what wrote that message in minuscules, but I will warn you it was not written in vain. There are abominations and blasphemies which must be stamped out, and I believe that the writer of those words will attend to Orne and Hutchinson. One of those creatures wrote you once, do not call up any that you can not put down. You were undone once before, perhaps in that very way, and it may be that your own evil magic will undo you all again. Curwen, a man cant tamper with Nature beyond certain limits, and every horror you have woven will rise up to wipe you out.\"      But here the doctor was cut short by a convulsive cry from the creature before him. Hopelessly at bay, weaponless, and knowing that any show of physical violence would bring a score of attendants to the doctors rescue, Joseph Curwen had recourse to his one ancient ally, and began a series of cabbalistic motions with his forefingers as his deep, hollow voice, now unconcealed by feigned hoarseness, bellowed out the opening words of a terrible formula.      \"PER ADONAI ELOIM, ADONAI JEHOVA, ADONAI SABAOTH, METRATON. . . .\"      But Willett was too quick for him. Even as the dogs in the yard outside began to howl, and even as a chill wind sprang suddenly up from the bay, the doctor commenced the solemn and measured intonation of that which he had meant all along to recite. An eye for an eye - magic for magic - let the outcome shew how well the lesson of the abyss had been learned! So in a clear voice Marinus Bicknell Willett began the second of that pair of formulae whose first had raised the writer of those minuscules - the cryptic invocation whose heading was the Dragons Tail, sign of the descending node - \"OGTHROD AIFGEBL - EEHYOG-SOTHOTHNGAHNG AIYZHRO!\"      At the very first word from Willetts mouth the previously commenced formula of the patient stopped short. Unable to speak, the monster made wild motions with his arms until they too were arrested. When the awful name of Yog-Sothoth was uttered, the hideous change began. It was not merely a dissolution, but rather a transformation or recapitulation; and Willett shut his eyes lest he faint before the rest of the incantation could be pronounced.      But he did not faint, and that man of unholy centuries and forbidden secrets never troubled the world again. The madness out of time had subsided, and the case of Charles Dexter Ward was closed. Opening his eyes before staggering out of that room of horror, Dr. Willett saw that what he had kept in memory had not been kept amiss. There had, as he had predicted, been no need for acids. For like his accursed picture a year before, Joseph Curwen now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust.", "V.The following winter brought an event no less strange than Wilbur’s first trip outside the Dunwich region. Correspondence with the Widener Library at Harvard, the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, the British Museum, the University of Buenos Ayres, and the Library of Miskatonic University of Arkham had failed to get him the loan of a book he desperately wanted; so at length he set out in person, shabby, dirty, bearded, and uncouth of dialect, to consult the copy at Miskatonic, which was the nearest to him geographically. Almost eight feet tall, and carrying a cheap new valise from Osborn’s general store, this dark and goatish gargoyle appeared one day in Arkham in quest of the dreaded volume kept under lock and key at the college library—the hideous Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred in Olaus Wormius’ Latin version, as printed in Spain in the seventeenth century. He had never seen a city before, but had no thought save to find his way to the university grounds; where, indeed, he passed heedlessly by the great white-fanged watchdog that barked with unnatural fury and enmity, and tugged frantically at its stout chain.      Wilbur had with him the priceless but imperfect copy of Dr. Dee’s English version which his grandfather had bequeathed him, and upon receiving access to the Latin copy he at once began to collate the two texts with the aim of discovering a certain passage which would have come on the 751st page of his own defective volume. This much he could not civilly refrain from telling the librarian—the same erudite Henry Armitage (A.M. Miskatonic, Ph. D. Princeton, Litt. D. Johns Hopkins) who had once called at the farm, and who now politely plied him with questions. He was looking, he had to admit, for a kind of formula or incantation containing the frightful name Yog-Sothoth, and it puzzled him to find discrepancies, duplications, and ambiguities which made the matter of determination far from easy. As he copied the formula he finally chose, Dr. Armitage looked involuntarily over his shoulder at the open pages; the left-hand one of which, in the Latin version, contained such monstrous threats to the peace and sanity of the world.      “Nor is it to be thought,” ran the text as Armitage mentally translated it, “that man is either the oldest or the last of earth’s masters, or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone. The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not in the spaces we know, but between them, They walk serene and primal, undimensioned and to us unseen. Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where They have trod earth’s fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread. By Their smell can men sometimes know Them near, but of Their semblance can no man know, saving only in the features of those They have begotten on mankind; and of those are there many sorts, differing in likeness from man’s truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance which is Them. They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with Their voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness. They bend the forest and crush the city, yet may not forest or city behold the hand that smites. Kadath in the cold waste hath known Them, and what man knows Kadath? The ice desert of the South and the sunken isles of Ocean hold stones whereon Their seal is engraven, but who hath seen the deep frozen city or the sealed tower long garlanded with seaweed and barnacles? Great Cthulhu is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only dimly. Iä! Shub-Niggurath! As a foulness shall ye know Them. Their hand is at your throats, yet ye see Them not; and Their habitation is even one with your guarded threshold. Yog-Sothoth is the key to the gate, whereby the spheres meet. Man rules now where They ruled once; They shall soon rule where man rules now. After summer is winter, and after winter summer. They wait patient and potent, for here shall They reign again.”      Dr. Armitage, associating what he was reading with what he had heard of Dunwich and its brooding presences, and of Wilbur Whateley and his dim, hideous aura that stretched from a dubious birth to a cloud of probable matricide, felt a wave of fright as tangible as a draught of the tomb’s cold clamminess. The bent, goatish giant before him seemed like the spawn of another planet or dimension; like something only partly of mankind, and linked to black gulfs of essence and entity that stretch like titan phantasms beyond all spheres of force and matter, space and time. Presently Wilbur raised his head and began speaking in that strange, resonant fashion which hinted at sound-producing organs unlike the run of mankind’s.      “Mr. Armitage,” he said, “I calc’late I’ve got to take that book home. They’s things in it I’ve got to try under sarten conditions that I can’t git here, an’ it ’ud be a mortal sin to let a red-tape rule hold me up. Let me take it along, Sir, an’ I’ll swar they wun’t nobody know the difference. I dun’t need to tell ye I’ll take good keer of it. It wa’n’t me that put this Dee copy in the shape it is. . . .”      He stopped as he saw firm denial on the librarian’s face, and his own goatish features grew crafty. Armitage, half-ready to tell him he might make a copy of what parts he needed, thought suddenly of the possible consequences and checked himself. There was too much responsiblity in giving such a being the key to such blasphemous outer spheres. Whateley saw how things stood, and tried to answer lightly.      “Wal, all right, ef ye feel that way abaout it. Maybe Harvard wun’t be so fussy as yew be.” And without saying more he rose and strode out of the building, stooping at each doorway.      Armitage heard the savage yelping of the great watchdog, and studied Whateley’s gorilla-like lope as he crossed the bit of campus visible from the window. He thought of the wild tales he had heard, and recalled the old Sunday stories in the Advertiser; these things, and the lore he had picked up from Dunwich rustics and villagers during his one visit there. Unseen things not of earth—or at least not of tri-dimensional earth—rushed foetid and horrible through New England’s glens, and brooded obscenely on the mountain-tops. Of this he had long felt certain. Now he seemed to sense the close presence of some terrible part of the intruding horror, and to glimpse a hellish advance in the black dominion of the ancient and once passive nightmare. He locked away the Necronomicon with a shudder of disgust, but the room still reeked with an unholy and unidentifiable stench. “As a foulness shall ye know them,” he quoted. Yes—the odour was the same as that which had sickened him at the Whateley farmhouse less than three years before. He thought of Wilbur, goatish and ominous, once again, and laughed mockingly at the village rumours of his parentage.      “Inbreeding?” Armitage muttered half-aloud to himself. “Great God, what simpletons! Shew them Arthur Machen’s Great God Pan and they’ll think it a common Dunwich scandal! But what thing—what cursed shapeless influence on or off this three-dimensioned earth—was Wilbur Whateley’s father? Born on Candlemas—nine months after May-Eve of 1912, when the talk about the queer earth noises reached clear to Arkham— What walked on the mountains that May-Night? What Roodmas horror fastened itself on the world in half-human flesh and blood?”      During the ensuing weeks Dr. Armitage set about to collect all possible data on Wilbur Whateley and the formless presences around Dunwich. He got in communication with Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury, who had attended Old Whateley in his last illness, and found much to ponder over in the grandfather’s last words as quoted by the physician. A visit to Dunwich Village failed to bring out much that was new; but a close survey of the Necronomicon, in those parts which Wilbur had sought so avidly, seemed to supply new and terrible clues to the nature, methods, and desires of the strange evil so vaguely threatening this planet. Talks with several students of archaic lore in Boston, and letters to many others elsewhere, gave him a growing amazement which passed slowly through varied degrees of alarm to a state of really acute spiritual fear. As the summer drew on he felt dimly that something ought to be done about the lurking terrors of the upper Miskatonic valley, and about the monstrous being known to the human world as Wilbur Whateley."]}
{"id": "EN098", "pair": ["III. A Search and an Evocation1.Charles Ward, as we have seen, first learned in 1918 of his descent from Joseph Curwen. That he at once took an intense interest in everything pertaining to the bygone mystery is not to be wondered at; for every vague rumour that he had heard of Curwen now became something vital to himself, in whom flowed Curwens blood. No spirited and imaginative genealogist could have done otherwise than begin forthwith an avid and systematic collection of Curwen data.      In his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at secrecy; so that even Dr. Lyman hesitates to date the youths madness from any period before the close of 1919. He talked freely with his family - though his mother was not particularly pleased to own an ancestor like Curwen - and with the officials of the various museums and libraries he visited. In applying to private families for records thought to be in their possession he made no concealment of his object, and shared the somewhat amused scepticism with which the accounts of the old diarists and letter-writers were regarded. He often expressed a keen wonder as to what really had taken place a century and a half before at that Pawtuxet farmhouse whose site he vainly tried to find, and what Joseph Curwen really had been.      When he came across the Smith diary and archives and encountered the letter from Jedediah Orne he decided to visit Salem and look up Curwens early activities and connexions there, which he did during the Easter vacation of 1919. At the Essex Institute, which was well known to him from former sojourns in the glamorous old town of crumbling Puritan gables and clustered gambrel roofs, he was very kindly received, and unearthed there a considerable amount of Curwen data. He found that his ancestor was born in Salem-Village, now Danvers, seven miles from town, on the eighteenth of February (O.S.) 1662-3; and that he had run away to sea at the age of fifteen, not appearing again for nine years, when he returned with the speech, dress, and manners of a native Englishman and settled in Salem proper. At that time he had little to do with his family, but spent most of his hours with the curious books he had brought from Europe, and the strange chemicals which came for him on ships from England, France, and Holland. Certain trips of his into the country were the objects of much local inquisitiveness, and were whisperingly associated with vague rumours of fires on the hills at night.      Curwens only close friends had been one Edward Hutchinson of Salem-Village and one Simon Orne of Salem. With these men he was often seen in conference about the Common, and visits among them were by no means infrequent. Hutchinson had a house well out toward the woods, and it was not altogether liked by sensitive people because of the sounds heard there at night. He was said to entertain strange visitors, and the lights seen from his windows were not always of the same colour. The knowledge he displayed concerning long-dead persons and long-forgotten events was considered distinctly unwholesome, and he disappeared about the time the witchcraft panic began, never to be heard from again. At that time Joseph Curwen also departed, but his settlement in Providence was soon learned of. Simon Orne lived in Salem until 1720, when his failure to grow visibly old began to excite attention. He thereafter disappeared, though thirty years later his precise counterpart and self-styled son turned up to claim his property. The claim was allowed on the strength of documents in Simon Ornes known hand, and Jedediah Orne continued to dwell in Salem till 1771, when certain letters from Providence citizens to the Rev. Thomas Barnard and others brought about his quiet removal to parts unknown.      Certain documents by and about all of these strange characters were available at the Essex Institute, the Court House, and the Registry of Deeds, and included both harmless commonplaces such as land titles and bills of sale, and furtive fragments of a more provocative nature. There were four or five unmistakable allusions to them on the witchcraft trial records; as when one Hepzibah Lawson swore on July 10, 1692, at the Court of Oyer and Terminer under Judge Hathorne, that fortie Witches and the Blacke Man were wont to meete in the Woodes behind Mr. Hutchinsons house, and one Amity How declared at a session of August 8th before Judge Gedney that Mr. G. B. (Rev. George Burroughs) on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B. Then there was a catalogue of Hutchinsons uncanny library as found after his disappearance, and an unfinished manuscript in his handwriting, couched in a cipher none could read. Ward had a photostatic copy of this manuscript made, and began to work casually on the cipher as soon as it was delivered to him. After the following August his labours on the cipher became intense and feverish, and there is reason to believe from his speech and conduct that he hit upon the key before October or November. He never stated, though, whether or not he had succeeded.      But of the greatest immediate interest was the Orne material. It took Ward only a short time to prove from identity of penmanship a thing he had already considered established from the text of the letter to Curwen; namely, that Simon Orne and his supposed son were one and the same person. As Orne had said to his correspondent, it was hardly safe to live too long in Salem, hence he resorted to a thirty-year sojourn abroad, and did not return to claim his lands except as a representative of a new generation. Orne had apparently been careful to destroy most of his correspondence, but the citizens who took action in 1771 found and preserved a few letters and papers which excited their wonder. There were cryptic formulae and diagrams in his and other hands which Ward now either copied with care or had photographed, and one extremely mysterious letter in a chirography that the searcher recognised from items in the Registry of Deeds as positively Joseph Curwens.      This Curwen letter, though undated as to the year, was evidently not the one in answer to which Orne had written the confiscated missive; and from internal evidence Ward placed it not much later than 1750. It may not be amiss to give the text in full, as a sample of the style of one whose history was so dark and terrible. The recipient is addressed as \"Simon\", but a line (whether drawn by Curwen or Orne Ward could not tell) is run through the word.Prouidence, I.

This letter, oddly enough, was what first gave Ward the exact location of Curwens Providence home; for none of the records encountered up to that time had been at all specific. The discovery was doubly striking because it indicated as the newer Curwen house built in 1761 on the site of the old, a dilapidated building still standing in Olney Court and well known to Ward in his antiquarian rambles over Stampers Hill. The place was indeed only a few squares from his own home on the great hills higher ground, and was now the abode of a negro family much esteemed for occasional washing, housecleaning, and furnace-tending services. To find, in distant Salem, such sudden proof of the significance of this familiar rookery in his own family history, was a highly impressive thing to Ward; and he resolved to explore the place immediately upon his return. The more mystical phases of the letter, which he took to be some extravagant kind of symbolism, frankly baffled him; though he noted with a thrill of curiosity that the Biblical passage referred to - Job 14, 14 - was the familiar verse, \"If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.\"2.      Young Ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement, and spent the following Saturday in a long and exhaustive study of the house in Olney Court. The place, now crumbling with age, had never been a mansion; but was a modest two-and-a-half story wooden town house of the familiar Providence colonial type, with plain peaked roof, large central chimney, and artistically carved doorway with rayed fanlight, triangular pediment, and trim Doric pilasters. It had suffered but little alteration externally, and Ward felt he was gazing on something very close to the sinister matters of his quest.      The present negro inhabitants were known to him, and he was very courteously shewn about the interior by old Asa and his stout wife Hannah. Here there was more change than the outside indicated, and Ward saw with regret that fully half of the fine scroll-and-urn overmantels and shell-carved cupboard linings were gone, whilst much of the fine wainscotting and bolection moulding was marked, hacked, and gouged, or covered up altogether with cheap wall-paper. In general, the survey did not yield as much as Ward had somehow expected; but it was at least exciting to stand within the ancestral walls which had housed such a man of horror as Joseph Curwen. He saw with a thrill that a monogram had been very carefully effaced from the ancient brass knocker.      From then until after the close of school Ward spent his time on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local Curwen data. The former still proved unyielding; but of the latter he obtained so much, and so many clues to similar data elsewhere, that he was ready by July to make a trip to New London and New York to consult old letters whose presence in those places was indicated. This trip was very fruitful, for it brought him the Fenner letters with their terrible description of the Pawtuxet farmhouse raid, and the Nightingale-Talbot letters in which he learned of the portrait painted on a panel of the Curwen library. This matter of the portrait interested him particularly, since he would have given much to know just what Joseph Curwen looked like; and he decided to make a second search of the house in Olney Court to see if there might not be some trace of the ancient features beneath peeling coats of later paint or layers of mouldy wall-paper.      Early in August that search took place, and Ward went carefully over the walls of every room sizeable enough to have been by any possibility the library of the evil builder. He paid especial attention to the large panels of such overmantels as still remained; and was keenly excited after about an hour, when on a broad area above the fireplace in a spacious ground-floor room he became certain that the surface brought out by the peeling of several coats of paint was sensibly darker than any ordinary interior paint or the wood beneath it was likely to have been. A few more careful tests with a thin knife, and he knew that he had come upon an oil portrait of great extent. With truly scholarly restraint the youth did not risk the damage which an immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture with the knife might have done, but just retired from the scene of his discovery to enlist expert help. In three days he returned with an artist of long experience, Mr. Walter C. Dwight, whose studio is near the foot of College Hill; and that accomplished restorer of paintings set to work at once with proper methods and chemical substances. Old Asa and his wife were duly excited over their strange visitors, and were properly reimbursed for this invasion of their domestic hearth.      As day by day the work of restoration progressed, Charles Ward looked on with growing interest at the lines and shades gradually unveiled after their long oblivion. Dwight had begun at the bottom; hence since the picture was a three-quarter-length one, the face did not come out for some time. It was meanwhile seen that the subject was a spare, well-shaped man with dark-blue coat, embroidered waistcoat, black satin small-clothes, and white silk stockings, seated in a carved chair against the background of a window with wharves and ships beyond. When the head came out it was observed to bear a neat Albemarle wig, and to possess a thin, calm, undistinguished face which seemed somehow familiar to both Ward and the artist. Only at the very last, though, did the restorer and his client begin to gasp with astonishment at the details of that lean, pallid visage, and to recognise with a touch of awe the dramatic trick which heredity had played. For it took the final bath of oil and the final stroke of the delicate scraper to bring out fully the expression which centuries had hidden; and to confront the bewildered Charles Dexter Ward, dweller in the past, with his own living features in the countenance of his horrible great-great-great-grandfather.      Ward brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered, and his father at once determined to purchase the picture despite its execution on stationary panelling. The resemblance to the boy, despite an appearance of rather greater age, was marvellous; and it could be seen that through some trick of atavism the physical contours of Joseph Curwen had found precise duplication after a century and a half. Mrs. Wards resemblance to her ancestor was not at all marked, though she could recall relatives who had some of the facial characteristics shared by her son and by the bygone Curwen. She did not relish the discovery, and told her husband that he had better burn the picture instead of bringing it home. There was, she averred, something unwholesome about it; not only intrinsically, but in its very resemblance to Charles. Mr. Ward, however, was a practical man of power and affairs - a cotton manufacturer with extensive mills at Riverpoint in the Pawtuxet Valley - and not one to listen to feminine scruples. The picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to his son, and he believed the boy deserved it as a present. In this opinion, it is needless to say, Charles most heartily concurred; and a few days later Mr. Ward located the owner of the house - a small rodent-featured person with a guttural accent - and obtained the whole mantel and overmantel bearing the picture at a curtly fixed priced which cut short the impending torrent of unctuous haggling.      It now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the Ward home, where provisions were made for its thorough restoration and installation with an electric mock-fireplace in Charless third-floor study or library. To Charles was left the task of superintending this removal, and on the twenty-eighth of August he accompanied two expert workmen from the Crooker decorating firm to the house in Olney Court, where the mantel and portrait-bearing overmantel were detached with great care and precision for transportation in the companys motor truck. There was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the chimneys course, and in this young Ward observed a cubical recess about a foot square, which must have lain directly behind the head of the portrait. Curious as to what such a space might mean or contain, the youth approached and looked within; finding beneath the deep coatings of dust and soot some loose yellowed papers, a crude, thick copybook, and a few mouldering textile shreds which may have formed the ribbon binding the rest together. Blowing away the bulk of the dirt and cinders, he took up the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover. It was in a hand which he had learned to recognise at the Essex Institute, and proclaimed the volume as the \"Journall and Notes of Jos: Curwen, Gent., of Providence-Plantations, Late of Salem.\"      Excited beyond measure by his discovery, Ward shewed the book to the two curious workmen beside him. Their testimony is absolute as to the nature and genuineness of the finding, and Dr. Willett relies on them to help establish his theory that the youth was not mad when he began his major eccentricities. All the other papers were likewise in Curwens handwriting, and one of them seemed especially portentous because of its inscription: \"To Him Who Shal Come After, & How He May Gett Beyonde Time & ye Spheres.\" Another was in a cipher; the same, Ward hoped, as the Hutchinson cipher which had hitherto baffled him. A third, and here the searcher rejoiced, seemed to be a key to the cipher; whilst the fourth and fifth were addressed respectively to \"Edw: Hutchinson, Armiger\" and \"Jedediah Orne, Esq.\", or Their Heir or Heirs, or Those Representg Them. The sixth and last was inscribed: \"Joseph Curwen his Life and Travells Betn ye yeares 1678 and 1687: Of Whither He Voyagd, Where He Stayd, Whom He Sawe, and What He Learnt.\"3.      We have now reached the point from which the more academic school of alienists date Charles Wards madness. Upon his discovery the youth had looked immediately at a few of the inner pages of the book and manuscripts, and had evidently seen something which impressed him tremendously. Indeed, in shewing the titles to the workmen he appeared to guard the text itself with peculiar care, and to labour under a perturbation for which even the antiquarian and genealogical significance of the find could hardly account. Upon returning home he broke the news with an almost embarrassed air, as if he wished to convey an idea of its supreme importance without having to exhibit the evidence itself. He did not even shew the titles to his parents, but simply told them that he had found some documents in Joseph Curwens handwriting, \"mostly in cipher\", which would have to be studied very carefully before yielding up their true meaning. It is unlikely that he would have shewn what he did to the workmen, had it not been for their unconcealed curiosity. As it was he doubtless wished to avoid any display of peculiar reticence which would increase their discussion of the matter.      That night Charles Ward sat up in his room reading the new-found book and papers, and when day came he did not desist. His meals, on his urgent request when his mother called to see what was amiss, were sent up to him; and in the afternoon he appeared only briefly when the men came to install the Curwen picture and mantelpiece in his study. The next night he slept in snatches in his clothes, meanwhile wrestling feverishly with the unravelling of the cipher manuscript. In the morning his mother saw that he was at work on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher, which he had frequently shewn her before; but in response to her query he said that the Curwen key could not be applied to it. That afternoon he abandoned his work and watched the men fascinatedly as they finished their installation of the picture with its woodwork above a cleverly realistic electric log, setting the mock-fireplace and overmantel a little out from the north wall as if a chimney existed, and boxing in the sides with panelling to match the rooms. The front panel holding the picture was sawn and hinged to allow cupboard space behind it. After the workmen went he moved his work into the study and sat down before it with his eyes half on the cipher and half on the portrait which stared back at him like a year-adding and century-recalling mirror.      His parents, subsequently recalling his conduct at this period, give interesting details anent the policy of concealment which he practiced. Before servants he seldom hid any paper which he might be studying, since he rightly assumed that Curwens intricate and archaic chirography would be too much for them. With his parents, however, he was more circumspect; and unless the manuscript in question were a cipher, or a mere mass of cryptic symbols and unknown ideographs (as that entitled \"To Him Who Shal Come After etc.\" seemed to be), he would cover it with some convenient paper until his caller had departed. At night he kept the papers under lock and key in an antique cabinet of his, where he also placed them whenever he left the room. He soon resumed fairly regular hours and habits, except that his long walks and other outside interests seemed to cease. The opening of school, where he now began his senior year, seemed a great bore to him; and he frequently asserted his determination never to bother with college. He had, he said, important special investigations to make, which would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and the humanities than any university which the world could boast.      Naturally, only one who had always been more or less studious, eccentric, and solitary could have pursued this course for many days without attracting notice. Ward, however, was constitutionally a scholar and a hermit; hence his parents were less surprised than regretful at the close confinement and secrecy he adopted. At the same time, both his father and mother thought it odd that he would shew them no scrap of his treasure-trove, nor give any connected account of such data as he had deciphered. This reticence he explained away as due to a wish to wait until he might announce some connected revelation, but as the weeks passed without further disclosures there began to grow up between the youth and his family a kind of constraint; intensified in his mothers case by her manifest disapproval of all Curwen delvings.      During October Ward began visiting the libraries again, but no longer for the antiquarian matter of his former days. Witchcraft and magic, occultism and daemonology, were what he sought now; and when Providence sources proved unfruitful he would take the train for Boston and tap the wealth of the great library in Copley Square, the Widener Library at Harvard, or the Zion Research Library in Brookline, where certain rare works on Biblical subjects are available. He bought extensively, and fitted up a whole additional set of shelves in his study for newly acquired works on uncanny subjects; while during the Christmas holidays he made a round of out-of-town trips including one to Salem to consult certain records at the Essex Institute.      About the middle of January, 1920, there entered Wards bearing an element of triumph which he did not explain, and he was no more found at work upon the Hutchinson cipher. Instead, he inaugurated a dual policy of chemical research and record-scanning; fitting up for the one a laboratory in the unused attic of the house, and for the latter haunting all the sources of vital statistics in Providence. Local dealers in drugs and scientific supplies, later questioned, gave astonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and instruments he purchased; but clerks at the State House, the City Hall, and the various libraries agree as to the definite object of his second interest. He was searching intensely and feverishly for the grave of Joseph Curwen, from whose slate slab an older generation had so wisely blotted the name.      Little by little there grew upon the Ward family the conviction that something was wrong. Charles had had freaks and changes of minor interests before, but this growing secrecy and absorption in strange pursuits was unlike even him. His school work was the merest pretence; and although he failed in no test, it could be seen that the old application had all vanished. He had other concernments now; and when not in his new laboratory with a score of obsolete alchemical books, could be found either poring over old burial records down town or glued to his volumes of occult lore in his study, where the startlingly - one almost fancied increasingly - similar features of Joseph Curwen stared blandly at him from the great overmantel on the north wall.      Late in March Ward added to his archive-searching a ghoulish series of rambles about the various ancient cemeteries of the city. The cause appeared later, when it was learned from City Hall clerks that he had probably found an important clue. His quest had suddenly shifted from the grave of Joseph Curwen to that of one Naphthali Field; and this shift was explained when, upon going over the files that he had been over, the investigators actually found a fragmentary record of Curwens burial which had escaped the general obliteration, and which stated that the curious leaden coffin had been interred \"10 ft. S. and 5 ft. W. of Naphthali Fields grave in ye - \". The lack of a specified burying-ground in the surviving entry greatly complicated the search, and Naphthali Fields grave seemed as elusive as that of Curwen; but here no systematic effacement had existed, and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on the stone itself even if its record had perished. Hence the rambles - from which St. Johns (the former Kings) Churchyard and the ancient Congregational burying-ground in the midst of Swan Point Cemetery were excluded, since other statistics had shewn that the only Naphthali Field (obiit 1729) whose grave could have been meant had been a Baptist.4.      It was toward May when Dr. Willett, at the request of the senior Ward, and fortified with all the Curwen data which the family had gleaned from Charles in his non-secretive days, talked with the young man. The interview was of little value or conclusiveness, for Willett felt at every moment that Charles was thoroughly master of himself and in touch with matters of real importance; but it at least forced the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanour. Of a pallid, impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment, Ward seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits, though not to reveal their object. He stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early scientific knowledge, for the most part in cipher, of an apparent scope comparable only to the discoveries of Friar Bacon and perhaps surpassing even those. They were, however, meaningless except when correlated with a body of learning now wholly obsolete; so that their immediate presentation to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all impressiveness and dramatic significance. To take their vivid place in the history of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of which they evolved, and to this task of correlation Ward was now devoting himself. He was seeking to acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of the Curwen data must possess, and hoped in time to make a full announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to the world of thought. Not even Einstein, he declared, could more profoundly revolutionise the current conception of things.      As to his graveyard search, whose object he freely admitted, but the details of whose progress he did not relate, he said he had reason to think that Joseph Curwens mutilated headstone bore certain mystic symbols - carved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by those who had effaced the name - which were absolutely essential to the final solution of his cryptic system. Curwen, he believed, had wished to guard his secret with care; and had consequently distributed the data in an exceedingly curious fashion. When Dr. Willett asked to see the mystic documents, Ward displayed much reluctance and tried to put him off with such things as photostatic copies of the Hutchinson cipher and Orne formulae and diagrams; but finally shewed him the exteriors of some of the real Curwen finds - the \"Journall and Notes\", the cipher (title in cipher also), and the formula-filled message \"To Him Who Shal Come After\" - and let him glance inside such as were in obscure characters.      He also opened the diary at a page carefully selected for its innocuousness and gave Willett a glimpse of Curwens connected handwriting in English. The doctor noted very closely the crabbed and complicated letters, and the general aura of the seventeenth century which clung round both penmanship and style despite the writers survival into the eighteenth century, and became quickly certain that the document was genuine. The text itself was relatively trivial, and Willett recalled only a fragment:\"Wedn. 16 Octr. 1754. My Sloope the Wakeful this Day putt in from London with XX newe Men pickd up in ye Indies, Spaniards from Martineco and 2 Dutch Men from Surinam.

Simon hath not Writ these V. Weekes, but I expecte soon hearg from him.\"      When upon reaching this point Dr. Willett turned the leaf he was quickly checked by Ward, who almost snatched the book from his grasp. All that the doctor had a chance to see on the newly opened page was a brief pair of sentences; but these, strangely enough, lingered tenaciously in his memory. They ran: \"Ye Verse from Liber-Damnatus beg spoke V Roodmasses and IV Hallows-Eves, I am Hopeful ye Thing is breedg Outside ye Spheres. It will drawe One who is to Come, if I can make sure he shal bee, and he shall think on Past thinges and look back thro all ye yeares, against ye which I must have ready ye Saltes or That to make em with.\"      Willett saw no more, but somehow this small glimpse gave a new and vague terror to the painted features of Joseph Curwen which stared blandly down from the overmantel. Ever after that he entertained the odd fancy - which his medical skill of course assured him was only a fancy - that the eyes of the portrait had a sort of wish, if not an actual tendency, to follow young Charles Ward as he moved about the room. He stopped before leaving to study the picture closely, marvelling at its resemblance to Charles and memorising every minute detail of the cryptical, colourless face, even down to a slight scar or pit in the smooth brow above the right eye. Cosmo Alexander, he decided, was a painter worthy of the Scotland that produced Raeburn, and a teacher worthy of his illustrious pupil Gilbert Stuart.      Assured by the doctor that Charless mental health was in no danger, but that on the other hand he was engaged in researches which might prove of real importance, the Wards were more lenient than they might otherwise have been when during the following June the youth made positive his refusal to attend college. He had, he declared, studies of much more vital importance to pursue; and intimated a wish to go abroad the following year in order to avail himself of certain sources of data not existing in America. The senior Ward, while denying this latter wish as absurd for a boy of only eighteen, acquiesced regarding the university; so that after a none too brilliant graduation from the Moses Brown School there ensued for Charles a three-year period of intensive occult study and graveyard searching. He became recognised as an eccentric, and dropped even more completely from the sight of his familys friends than he had been before; keeping close to his work and only occasionally making trips to other cities to consult obscure records. Once he went south to talk with a strange old mulatto who dwelt in a swamp and about whom a newspaper had printed a curious article. Again he sought a small village in the Adirondacks whence reports of certain odd ceremonial practices had come. But still his parents forbade him the trip to the Old World which he desired.      Coming of age in April, 1923, and having previously inherited a small competence from his maternal grandfather, Ward determined at last to take the European trip hitherto denied him. Of his proposed itinerary he would say nothing save that the needs of his studies would carry him to many places, but he promised to write his parents fully and faithfully. When they saw he could not be dissuaded, they ceased all opposition and helped as best they could; so that in June the young man sailed for Liverpool with the farewell blessings of his father and mother, who accompanied him to Boston and waved him out of sight from the White Star pier in Charlestown. Letters soon told of his safe arrival, and of his securing good quarters in Great Russell Street, London; where he proposed to stay, shunning all family friends, till he had exhausted the resources of the British Museum in a certain direction. Of his daily life he wrote but little, for there was little to write. Study and experiment consumed all his time, and he mentioned a laboratory which he had established in one of his rooms. That he said nothing of antiquarian rambles in the glamorous old city with its luring skyline of ancient domes and steeples and its tangles of roads and alleys whose mystic convolutions and sudden vistas alternately beckon and surprise, was taken by his parents as a good index of the degree to which his new interests had engrossed his mind.      In June, 1924, a brief note told of his departure for Paris, to which he had before made one or two flying trips for material in the Bibliothque Nationale. For three months thereafter he sent only postal cards, giving an address in the Rue St. Jacques and referring to a special search among rare manuscripts in the library of an unnamed private collector. He avoided acquaintances, and no tourists brought back reports of having seen him. Then came a silence, and in October the Wards received a picture card from Prague, Czecho-Slovakia, stating that Charles was in that ancient town for the purpose of conferring with a certain very aged man supposed to be the last living possessor of some very curious mediaeval information. He gave an address in the Neustadt, and announced no move till the following January; when he dropped several cards from Vienna telling of his passage through that city on the way toward a more easterly region whither one of his correspondents and fellow-delvers into the occult had invited him.      The next card was from Klausenburg in Transylvania, and told of Wards progress toward his destination. He was going to visit a Baron Ferenczy, whose estate lay in the mountains east of Rakus; and was to be addressed at Rakus in the care of that nobleman. Another card from Rakus a week later, saying that his hosts carriage had met him and that he was leaving the village for the mountains, was his last message for a considerable time; indeed, he did not reply to his parents frequent letters until May, when he wrote to discourage the plan of his mother for a meeting in London, Paris, or Rome during the summer, when the elder Wards were planning to travel in Europe. His researches, he said, were such that he could not leave his present quarters; while the situation of Baron Ferenczys castle did not favour visits. It was on a crag in the dark wooded mountains, and the region was so shunned by the country folk that normal people could not help feeling ill at ease. Moreover, the Baron was not a person likely to appeal to correct and conservative New England gentlefolk. His aspect and manners had idiosyncrasies, and his age was so great as to be disquieting. It would be better, Charles said, if his parents would wait for his return to Providence; which could scarcely be far distant.      That return did not, however, take place until May, 1926, when after a few heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into New York on the Homeric and traversed the long miles to Providence by motor-coach, eagerly drinking in the green rolling hills, the fragrant, blossoming orchards, and the white steepled towns of vernal Connecticut; his first taste of ancient New England in nearly four years. When the coach crossed the Pawcatuck and entered Rhode Island amidst the faery goldenness of a late spring afternoon his heart beat with quickened force, and the entry to Providence along Reservoir and Elmwood avenues was a breathless and wonderful thing despite the depths of forbidden lore to which he had delved. At the high square where Broad, Weybosset, and Empire Streets join, he saw before and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant, remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town; and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down the terminal behind the Biltmore, bringing into view the great dome and soft, roof-pierced greenery of the ancient hill across the river, and the tall colonial spire of the First Baptist Church limned pink in the magic evening light against the fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous background.      Old Providence! It was this place and the mysterious forces of its long, continuous history which had brought him into being, and which had drawn him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no prophet might fix. Here lay the arcana, wondrous or dreadful as the case might be, for which all his years of travel and application had been preparing him. A taxicab whirled him through Post Office Square with its glimpse of the river, the old Market House, and the head of the bay, and up the steep curved slope of Waterman Street to Prospect, where the vast gleaming dome and sunset-flushed Ionic columns of the Christian Science Church beckoned northward. Then eight squares past the fine old estates his childish eyes had known, and the quaint brick sidewalks so often trodden by his youthful feet. And at last the little white overtaken farmhouse on the right, on the left the classic Adam porch and stately bayed facade of the great brick house where he was born. It was twilight, and Charles Dexter Ward had come home.5.      A school of alienists slightly less academic than Dr. Lymans assign to Wards European trip the beginning of his true madness. Admitting that he was sane when he started, they believe that his conduct upon returning implies a disastrous change. But even to this claim Dr. Willett refuses to accede. There was, he insists, something later; and the queernesses of the youth at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroad - odd enough things, to be sure, but by no means implying mental aberration on the part of their celebrant. Ward himself, though visibly aged and hardened, was still normal in his general reactions; and in several talks with Willett displayed a balance which no madman - even an incipient one - could feign continuously for long. What elicited the notion of insanity at this period were the sounds heard at all hours from Wards attic laboratory, in which he kept himself most of the time. There were chantings and repetitions, and thunderous declamations in uncanny rhythms; and although these sounds were always in Wards own voice, there was something in the quality of that voice, and in the accents of the formulae it pronounced, which could not but chill the blood of every hearer. It was noticed that Nig, the venerable and beloved black cat of the household, bristled and arched his back perceptibly when certain of the tones were heard.      The odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise exceedingly strange. Sometimes they were very noxious, but more often they were aromatic, with a haunting, elusive quality which seemed to have the power of inducing fantastic images. People who smelled them had a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas, with strange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite distance. Ward did not resume his old-time rambles, but applied himself diligently to the strange books he had brought home, and to equally strange delvings within his quarters; explaining that European sources had greatly enlarged the possibilities of his work, and promising great revelations in the years to come. His older aspect increased to a startling degree his resemblance to the Curwen portrait in his library; and Dr. Willett would often pause by the latter after a call, marvelling at the virtual identity, and reflecting that only the small pit above the pictures right eye now remained to differentiate the long-dead wizard from the living youth. These calls of Willetts, undertaken at the request of the senior Wards, were curious affairs. Ward at no time repulsed the doctor, but the latter saw that he could never reach the young mans inner psychology. Frequently he noted peculiar things about; little wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables, and the half-erased remnants of circles, triangles, and pentagrams in chalk or charcoal on the cleared central space of the large room. And always in the night those rhythms and incantations thundered, till it became very difficult to keep servants or suppress furtive talk of Charless madness.      In January, 1927, a peculiar incident occurred. One night about midnight, as Charles was chanting a ritual whose weird cadence echoed unpleasantly through the house below, there came a sudden gust of chill wind from the bay, and a faint, obscure trembling of the earth which everyone in the neighbourhood noted. At the same time the cat exhibited phenomenal traces of fright, while dogs bayed for as much as a mile around. This was the prelude to a sharp thunderstorm, anomalous for the season, which brought with it such a crash that Mr. and Mrs. Ward believed the house had been struck. They rushed upstairs to see what damage had been done, but Charles met them at the door to the attic; pale, resolute, and portentous, with an almost fearsome combination of triumph and seriousness on his face. He assured them that the house had not really been struck, and that the storm would soon be over. They paused, and looking through a window saw that he was indeed right; for the lightning flashed farther and farther off, whilst the trees ceased to bend in the strange frigid gust from the water. The thunder sank to a sort of dull mumbling chuckle and finally died away. Stars came out, and the stamp of triumph on Charles Wards face crystallised into a very singular expression.      For two months or more after this incident Ward was less confined than usual to his laboratory. He exhibited a curious interest in the weather, and made odd inquiries about the date of the spring thawing of the ground. One night late in March he left the house after midnight, and did not return till almost morning; when his mother, being wakeful, heard a rumbling motor draw up to the carriage entrance. Muffled oaths could be distinguished, and Mrs. Ward, rising and going to the window, saw four dark figures removing a long, heavy box from a truck at Charless direction and carrying it within by the side door. She heard laboured breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs, and finally a dull thumping in the attic; after which the footfalls descended again, and the four men reappeared outside and drove off in their truck.      The next day Charles resumed his strict attic seclusion, drawing down the dark shades of his laboratory windows and appearing to be working on some metal substance. He would open the door to no one, and steadfastly refused all proffered food. About noon a wrenching sound followed by a terrible cry and a fall were heard, but when Mrs. Ward rapped at the door her son at length answered faintly, and told her that nothing had gone amiss. The hideous and indescribable stench now welling out was absolutely harmless and unfortunately necessary. Solitude was the one prime essential, and he would appear later for dinner. That afternoon, after the conclusion of some odd hissing sounds which came from behind the locked portal, he did finally appear; wearing an extremely haggard aspect and forbidding anyone to enter the laboratory upon any pretext. This, indeed, proved the beginning of a new policy of secrecy; for never afterward was any other person permitted to visit either the mysterious garret workroom or the adjacent storeroom which he cleaned out, furnished roughly, and added to his inviolably private domain as a sleeping apartment. Here he lived, with books brought up from his library beneath, till the time he purchased the Pawtuxet bungalow and moved to it all his scientific effects.      In the evening Charles secured the paper before the rest of the family and damaged part of it through an apparent accident. Later on Dr. Willett, having fixed the date from statements by various members of the household, looked up an intact copy at the Journal office and found that in the destroyed section the following small item had occurred:Nocturnal Diggers Surprised inNorth Burial GroundRobert Hart, night watchman at the North Burial Ground, this morning discovered a party of several men with a motor truck in the oldest part of the cemetery, but apparently frightened them off before they had accomplished whatever their object may have been.      The discovery took place at about four oclock, when Harts attention was attracted by the sound of a motor outside his shelter. Investigating, he saw a large truck on the main drive several rods away; but could not reach it before the sound of his feet on the gravel had revealed his approach. The men hastily placed a large box in the truck and drove away toward the street before they could be overtaken; and since no known grave was disturbed, Hart believes that this box was an object which they wished to bury.      The diggers must have been at work for a long while before detection, for Hart found an enormous hole dug at a considerable distance back from the roadway in the lot of Amasa Field, where most of the old stones have long ago disappeared. The hole, a place as large and deep as a grave, was empty; and did not coincide with any interment mentioned in the cemetery records.      Sergt. Riley of the Second Station viewed the spot and gave the opinion that the hole was dug by bootleggers rather gruesomely and ingeniously seeking a safe cache for liquor in a place not likely to be disturbed. In reply to questions Hart said he thought the escaping truck had headed up Rochambeau Avenue, though he could not be sure.      During the next few days Ward was seldom seen by his family. Having added sleeping quarters to his attic realm, he kept closely to himself there, ordering food brought to the door and not taking it in until after the servant had gone away. The droning of monotonous formulae and the chanting of bizarre rhythms recurred at intervals, while at other times occasional listeners could detect the sound of tinkling glass, hissing chemicals, running water, or roaring gas flames. Odours of the most unplaceable quality, wholly unlike any before noted, hung at times around the door; and the air of tension observable in the young recluse whenever he did venture briefly forth was such as to excite the keenest speculation. Once he made a hasty trip to the Athenaeum for a book he required, and again he hired a messenger to fetch him a highly obscure volume from Boston. Suspense was written portentously over the whole situation, and both the family and Dr. Willett confessed themselves wholly at a loss what to do or think about it.6.      Then on the fifteenth of April a strange development occurred. While nothing appeared to grow different in kind, there was certainly a very terrible difference in degree; and Dr. Willett somehow attaches great significance to the change. The day was Good Friday, a circumstance of which the servants made much, but which others quite naturally dismiss as an irrelevant coincidence. Late in the afternoon young Ward began repeating a certain formula in a singularly loud voice, at the same time burning some substance so pungent that its fumes escaped over the entire house. The formula was so plainly audible in the hall outside the locked door that Mrs. Ward could not help memorising it as she waited and listened anxiously, and later on she was able to write it down at Dr. Willetts request. It ran as follows, and experts have told Dr. Willett that its very close analogue can be found in the mystic writings of \"Eliphas Levi\", that cryptic soul who crept through a crack in the forbidden door and glimpsed the frightful vistas of the void beyond:\"Per Adonai Eloim, Adonai Jehova,Adonai Sabaoth, Metraton On Agla Mathon,verbum pythonicum, mysterium salamandrae,conventus sylvorum, antra gnomorum,daemonia Coeli Gad, Almousin, Gibor, Jehosua,Evam, Zariatnatmik, veni, veni, veni.\"      This had been going on for two hours without change or intermission when over all the neighbourhood a pandaemoniac howling of dogs set in. The extent of this howling can be judged from the space it received in the papers the next day, but to those in the Ward household it was overshadowed by the odour which instantly followed it; a hideous, all-pervasive odour which none of them had ever smelt before or have ever smelt since. In the midst of this mephitic flood there came a very perceptible flash like that of lightning, which would have been blinding and impressive but for the daylight around; and then was heard the voice that no listener can ever forget because of its thunderous remoteness, its incredible depth, and its eldritch dissimilarity to Charles Wards voice. It shook the house, and was clearly heard by at least two neighbours above the howling of the dogs. Mrs. Ward, who had been listening in despair outside her sons locked laboratory, shivered as she recognised its hellish import; for Charles had told her of its evil fame in dark books, and of the manner in which it had thundered, according to the Fenner letters, above the doomed Pawtuxet farmhouse on the night of Joseph Curwens annihilation. There was no mistaking that nightmare phrase, for Charles had described it too vividly in the old days when he had talked frankly of his Curwen investigations. And yet it was only this fragment of an archaic and forgotten language: \"DIES MIES JESCHET BOENE DOESEF DOUVEMA ENITEMAUS\".      Close upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening of the daylight, though sunset was still an hour distant, and then a puff of added odour different from the first but equally unknown and intolerable. Charles was chanting again now and his mother could hear syllables that sounded like \"Yi-nash-Yog-Sothoth-he-lgeb-fi-throdog\" - ending in a \"Yah!\" whose maniacal force mounted in an ear-splitting crescendo. A second later all previous memories were effaced by the wailing scream which burst out with frantic explosiveness and gradually changed form to a paroxysm of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Mrs. Ward, with the mingled fear and blind courage of maternity, advanced and knocked affrightedly at the concealing panels, but obtained no sign of recognition. She knocked again, but paused nervelessly as a second shriek arose, this one unmistakably in the familiar voice of her son, and sounding concurrently with the still bursting cachinnations of that other voice. Presently she fainted, although she is still unable to recall the precise and immediate cause. Memory sometimes makes merciful deletions.      Mr. Ward returned from the business section at about quarter past six; and not finding his wife downstairs, was told by the frightened servants that she was probably watching at Charless door, from which the sounds had been far stranger than ever before. Mounting the stairs at once, he saw Mrs. Ward stretched at full length on the floor of the corridor outside the laboratory; and realising that she had fainted, hastened to fetch a glass of water from a set bowl in a neighbouring alcove. Dashing the cold fluid in her face, he was heartened to observe an immediate response on her part, and was watching the bewildered opening of her eyes when a chill shot through him and threatened to reduce him to the very state from which she was emerging. For the seemingly silent laboratory was not as silent as it had appeared to be, but held the murmurs of a tense, muffled conversation in tones too low for comprehension, yet of a quality profoundly disturbing to the soul.      It was not, of course, new for Charles to mutter formulae; but this muttering was definitely different. It was so palpably a dialogue, or imitation of a dialogue, with the regular alteration of inflections suggesting question and answer, statement and response. One voice was undisguisedly that of Charles, but the other had a depth and hollowness which the youths best powers of ceremonial mimicry had scarcely approached before. There was something hideous, blasphemous, and abnormal about it, and but for a cry from his recovering wife which cleared his mind by arousing his protective instincts it is not likely that Theodore Howland Ward could have maintained for nearly a year more his old boast that he had never fainted. As it was, he seized his wife in his arms and bore her quickly downstairs before she could notice the voices which had so horribly disturbed him. Even so, however, he was not quick enough to escape catching something himself which caused him to stagger dangerously with his burden. For Mrs. Wards cry had evidently been heard by others than he, and there had come from behind the locked door the first distinguishable words which that masked and terrible colloquy had yielded. They were merely an excited caution in Charless own voice, but somehow their implications held a nameless fright for the father who overheard them. The phrase was just this: \"Sshh! - write!\"      Mr. and Mrs. Ward conferred at some length after dinner, and the former resolved to have a firm and serious talk with Charles that very night. No matter how important the object, such conduct could no longer be permitted; for these latest developments transcended every limit of sanity and formed a menace to the order and nervous well-being of the entire household. The youth must indeed have taken complete leave of his senses, since only downright madness could have prompted the wild screams and imaginary conversations in assumed voices which the present day had brought forth. All this must be stopped, or Mrs. Ward would be made ill and the keeping of servants become an impossibility.      Mr. Ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for Charless laboratory. On the third floor, however, he paused at the sounds which he heard proceeding from the now disused library of his son. Books were apparently being flung about and papers wildly rustled, and upon stepping to the door Mr. Ward beheld the youth within, excitedly assembling a vast armful of literary matter of every size and shape. Charless aspect was very drawn and haggard, and he dropped his entire load with a start at the sound of his fathers voice. At the elder mans command he sat down, and for some time listened to the admonitions he had so long deserved. There was no scene. At the end of the lecture he agreed that his father was right, and that his noises, mutterings, incantations, and chemical odours were indeed inexcusable nuisances. He agreed to a policy of greater quiet, though insisting on a prolongation of his extreme privacy. Much of his future work, he said, was in any case purely book research; and he could obtain quarters elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be necessary at a later stage. For the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed the keenest contrition, and explained that the conversation later heard was part of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental atmosphere. His use of abstruse technical terms somewhat bewildered Mr. Ward, but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and poise despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity. The interview was really quite inconclusive, and as Charles picked up his armful and left the room Mr. Ward hardly knew what to make of the entire business. It was as mysterious as the death of poor old Nig, whose stiffening form had been found an hour before in the basement, with staring eyes and fear-distorted mouth.      Driven by some vague detective instinct, the bewildered parent now glanced curiously at the vacant shelves to see what his son had taken up to the attic. The youths library was plainly and rigidly classified, so that one might tell at a glance the books or at least the kind of books which had been withdrawn. On this occasion Mr. Ward was astonished to find that nothing of the occult or the antiquarian, beyond what had been previously removed, was missing. These new withdrawals were all modern items; histories, scientific treatises, geographies, manuals of literature, philosophic works, and certain contemporary newspapers and magazines. It was a very curious shift from Charles Wards recent run of reading, and the father paused in a growing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense of strangeness. The strangeness was a very poignant sensation, and almost clawed at his chest as he strove to see just what was wrong around him. Something was indeed wrong, and tangibly as well as spiritually so. Ever since he had been in this room he had known that something was amiss, and at last it dawned upon him what it was.      On the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the house in Olney Court, but to the cracked and precariously restored oils of the large Curwen portrait disaster had come. Time and unequal heating had done their work at last, and at some time since the rooms last cleaning the worst had happened. Peeling clear of the wood, curling tighter and tighter, and finally crumbling into small bits with what must have been malignly silent suddenness, the portrait of Joseph Curwen had resigned forever its staring surveillance of the youth it so strangely resembled, and now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust.", "V.The following winter brought an event no less strange than Wilbur’s first trip outside the Dunwich region. Correspondence with the Widener Library at Harvard, the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, the British Museum, the University of Buenos Ayres, and the Library of Miskatonic University of Arkham had failed to get him the loan of a book he desperately wanted; so at length he set out in person, shabby, dirty, bearded, and uncouth of dialect, to consult the copy at Miskatonic, which was the nearest to him geographically. Almost eight feet tall, and carrying a cheap new valise from Osborn’s general store, this dark and goatish gargoyle appeared one day in Arkham in quest of the dreaded volume kept under lock and key at the college library—the hideous Necronomicon of the mad Arab Abdul Alhazred in Olaus Wormius’ Latin version, as printed in Spain in the seventeenth century. He had never seen a city before, but had no thought save to find his way to the university grounds; where, indeed, he passed heedlessly by the great white-fanged watchdog that barked with unnatural fury and enmity, and tugged frantically at its stout chain.      Wilbur had with him the priceless but imperfect copy of Dr. Dee’s English version which his grandfather had bequeathed him, and upon receiving access to the Latin copy he at once began to collate the two texts with the aim of discovering a certain passage which would have come on the 751st page of his own defective volume. This much he could not civilly refrain from telling the librarian—the same erudite Henry Armitage (A.M. Miskatonic, Ph. D. Princeton, Litt. D. Johns Hopkins) who had once called at the farm, and who now politely plied him with questions. He was looking, he had to admit, for a kind of formula or incantation containing the frightful name Yog-Sothoth, and it puzzled him to find discrepancies, duplications, and ambiguities which made the matter of determination far from easy. As he copied the formula he finally chose, Dr. Armitage looked involuntarily over his shoulder at the open pages; the left-hand one of which, in the Latin version, contained such monstrous threats to the peace and sanity of the world.      “Nor is it to be thought,” ran the text as Armitage mentally translated it, “that man is either the oldest or the last of earth’s masters, or that the common bulk of life and substance walks alone. The Old Ones were, the Old Ones are, and the Old Ones shall be. Not in the spaces we know, but between them, They walk serene and primal, undimensioned and to us unseen. Yog-Sothoth knows the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the gate. Yog-Sothoth is the key and guardian of the gate. Past, present, future, all are one in Yog-Sothoth. He knows where the Old Ones broke through of old, and where They shall break through again. He knows where They have trod earth’s fields, and where They still tread them, and why no one can behold Them as They tread. By Their smell can men sometimes know Them near, but of Their semblance can no man know, saving only in the features of those They have begotten on mankind; and of those are there many sorts, differing in likeness from man’s truest eidolon to that shape without sight or substance which is Them. They walk unseen and foul in lonely places where the Words have been spoken and the Rites howled through at their Seasons. The wind gibbers with Their voices, and the earth mutters with Their consciousness. They bend the forest and crush the city, yet may not forest or city behold the hand that smites. Kadath in the cold waste hath known Them, and what man knows Kadath? The ice desert of the South and the sunken isles of Ocean hold stones whereon Their seal is engraven, but who hath seen the deep frozen city or the sealed tower long garlanded with seaweed and barnacles? Great Cthulhu is Their cousin, yet can he spy Them only dimly. Iä! Shub-Niggurath! As a foulness shall ye know Them. Their hand is at your throats, yet ye see Them not; and Their habitation is even one with your guarded threshold. Yog-Sothoth is the key to the gate, whereby the spheres meet. Man rules now where They ruled once; They shall soon rule where man rules now. After summer is winter, and after winter summer. They wait patient and potent, for here shall They reign again.”      Dr. Armitage, associating what he was reading with what he had heard of Dunwich and its brooding presences, and of Wilbur Whateley and his dim, hideous aura that stretched from a dubious birth to a cloud of probable matricide, felt a wave of fright as tangible as a draught of the tomb’s cold clamminess. The bent, goatish giant before him seemed like the spawn of another planet or dimension; like something only partly of mankind, and linked to black gulfs of essence and entity that stretch like titan phantasms beyond all spheres of force and matter, space and time. Presently Wilbur raised his head and began speaking in that strange, resonant fashion which hinted at sound-producing organs unlike the run of mankind’s.      “Mr. Armitage,” he said, “I calc’late I’ve got to take that book home. They’s things in it I’ve got to try under sarten conditions that I can’t git here, an’ it ’ud be a mortal sin to let a red-tape rule hold me up. Let me take it along, Sir, an’ I’ll swar they wun’t nobody know the difference. I dun’t need to tell ye I’ll take good keer of it. It wa’n’t me that put this Dee copy in the shape it is. . . .”      He stopped as he saw firm denial on the librarian’s face, and his own goatish features grew crafty. Armitage, half-ready to tell him he might make a copy of what parts he needed, thought suddenly of the possible consequences and checked himself. There was too much responsiblity in giving such a being the key to such blasphemous outer spheres. Whateley saw how things stood, and tried to answer lightly.      “Wal, all right, ef ye feel that way abaout it. Maybe Harvard wun’t be so fussy as yew be.” And without saying more he rose and strode out of the building, stooping at each doorway.      Armitage heard the savage yelping of the great watchdog, and studied Whateley’s gorilla-like lope as he crossed the bit of campus visible from the window. He thought of the wild tales he had heard, and recalled the old Sunday stories in the Advertiser; these things, and the lore he had picked up from Dunwich rustics and villagers during his one visit there. Unseen things not of earth—or at least not of tri-dimensional earth—rushed foetid and horrible through New England’s glens, and brooded obscenely on the mountain-tops. Of this he had long felt certain. Now he seemed to sense the close presence of some terrible part of the intruding horror, and to glimpse a hellish advance in the black dominion of the ancient and once passive nightmare. He locked away the Necronomicon with a shudder of disgust, but the room still reeked with an unholy and unidentifiable stench. “As a foulness shall ye know them,” he quoted. Yes—the odour was the same as that which had sickened him at the Whateley farmhouse less than three years before. He thought of Wilbur, goatish and ominous, once again, and laughed mockingly at the village rumours of his parentage.      “Inbreeding?” Armitage muttered half-aloud to himself. “Great God, what simpletons! Shew them Arthur Machen’s Great God Pan and they’ll think it a common Dunwich scandal! But what thing—what cursed shapeless influence on or off this three-dimensioned earth—was Wilbur Whateley’s father? Born on Candlemas—nine months after May-Eve of 1912, when the talk about the queer earth noises reached clear to Arkham— What walked on the mountains that May-Night? What Roodmas horror fastened itself on the world in half-human flesh and blood?”      During the ensuing weeks Dr. Armitage set about to collect all possible data on Wilbur Whateley and the formless presences around Dunwich. He got in communication with Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury, who had attended Old Whateley in his last illness, and found much to ponder over in the grandfather’s last words as quoted by the physician. A visit to Dunwich Village failed to bring out much that was new; but a close survey of the Necronomicon, in those parts which Wilbur had sought so avidly, seemed to supply new and terrible clues to the nature, methods, and desires of the strange evil so vaguely threatening this planet. Talks with several students of archaic lore in Boston, and letters to many others elsewhere, gave him a growing amazement which passed slowly through varied degrees of alarm to a state of really acute spiritual fear. As the summer drew on he felt dimly that something ought to be done about the lurking terrors of the upper Miskatonic valley, and about the monstrous being known to the human world as Wilbur Whateley."]}

With my heavy valise, Im fortunate that I only have to walk half that far from the restaurant at which Ive just dined. Once every month, I scrounge up enough money to have dinner at the Golden Goose. Despite my reputation in this village, I eventually come to long for the clamor of a crowd. The four walls of my fathers house are my sanctuary and prison otherwise. Only Theodora, our cook and housekeeper that weve had since before I was born, keeps me company there. I would take her with me on my monthly outings to Leights sole restaurant, but she stubbornly says she prefers her own meals all the same.Thats only part of the reason why she wont go, however. Ive told her that even at the Golden Goose, the diners there glare at me out of the corners of their eyes and lower them to their plates if I look their way. Theodora is an even more self-contained soul than I am, and loathes being stared at \"by all and sundry\".The evening sun is sinking low on the horizon, and the villagers around me are concealed in shadows. I dont want anyone coming up and asking me about my three-night errand - not that they would. When I prove the rumors about my forefathers establishment wrong, Ill make them all look like fools anyway!Those unfamiliar with Leight will notice three ever-present things as they travel down its main street: stalwart people, churches, and Cemetery Hill looming in the distance. Ever since I was a child, I sensed an eerie connection among these features of our humble village. Just what that is, I cannot say. They are ordinary enough on the surface, and yet I cant help feeling that theres something sinister about them.My neighbors are proud, hard-working souls. Most of them live on farms on the outskirts of town. Even so, they trudge nearly every day to its center in order to seek supplies. The men of Leight are burly, with long arms and sunburnt faces, trusting in their toil and suspicious of learnt folk. Its just as well that theyre illiterate. They wouldnt have much use for books even if they had the coin to buy them. Their wives, far from being what some people would call ladies, are just as industrious and sturdy as their husbands. I see them more often in town, as buying sundries is womens work, but that doesnt mean theyre any more inclined to talk to me. They keep to themselves, as I do, but it seems their hearts are under lock and key.I suspect that a large part of this has to do with the fact that they fear God as much as my familys past. Out of every ten buildings in Leight, at least four are churches. The Baptists, Catholics, Episcopalians, Evangelicals, Lutherans, Methodists, and even more denominations are continually at war. They each claim to believe in the Scriptures, and in the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. However, they also claim that all the others are false, to a greater or lesser degree. As for me? I attend no house of worship, and that is no great loss to me. My father, Lemuel Dawson, said that his own chapel - the one on Cemetery Hill - had been abruptly shuttered one Halloween night. His fellow congregants then fled to other nearby towns.\"My dear Millie,\" he had told me, \"the one true church on this Earth has been lost, and a year too early.\" Thats another thing Ive failed to understand, even though it haunts me as much as the Inn itself does.Hurrying to get there, I pass the people and churches without much concern. Only the visage of the former Gallows Hill, now containing graves instead of a gibbet, catches my eye. Buried there are not only the fifty-three souls who were hanged during the Purge (or so we called our witchcraft panic), but criminals and paupers. Ive often wondered why having no money is considered as great a crime as sorcery or theft, but in this village, if youre poor, then you are cursed. \"God helps those who help themselves\": so say we. I cannot help myself as I find my feet sprinting rather than walking toward the façade of the Dreamers Inn.The sky, now a cool blue-violet twilight, is growing dark. Ill soon leave light (and Leight?) behind. Even though Ive been inside the Dreamers Inn countless times, Ive always been a bit scared of the place. Why is it that, even though its supposed to be a haven for travelers, it seems like a mausoleum instead? I know that once I venture beyond its door, beneath the rickety sign that has announced its presence since the days of Abner Dawes, Ill be in a world unto itself. As such, I pause on the threshold and gaze up at its intimidating turret. Should I turn back and forget about spending a single night there, let alone three?Then I remember my reasons, both monetary and otherwise, and step inside.", "Some people who sleep at the Dreamers Inn, in my hometown of Leight, Massachusetts, never wake up.So it is said. Tis a wonder that our only boarding place for travelers manages to stay open at all, with the ceaseless grinding of the rumor mill reaching wayfarers ears before they reach here. Our villages moniker is pronounced as if the \"e\" were not there, nor any source of illumination. Despite our best efforts to redeem the name of Leight, it is still spoken like a curse. We are God-fearing folk now, in anno Domini 1893, but some of us werent two hundred years ago. The witchcraft panic that had hit Salem in 1692 infected us like a fever one year later. Fifty people were sickened, and cured by a visit to Gallows Hill.My great-great-grandfather and original proprietor of the Inn, Goodman Abner Dawes, was one of them.My name is Millicent Dawson. Even though Im four generations descended from him, respectable people in Leight cross to the other side of the street when they see me. If it werent for my late fathers pension, Id be searching these same streets for men too drunk to care about my ancestry. Im a spinster at thirty-four, but still pretty according to the Inns current owner. Not that Id have Monsieur Thènard! He is no drunkard, but sometimes I wish he were. His eyes, never bloodshot and always keen, are those of a wolf.Is it he that continues to lend the rumors such credence? Has he dared to murder his own customers?Pah! Its far more likely that the villagers, many of whom are superstitious illiterates, want to keep anyone from having anything to do with the Dreamers Inn because theyre terrified. I, for one, am not. I know my great-great-grandfathers establishment for what it is: a broken-down lodging house, greatly refurbished, with three floors and servants quarters at the top. Its the closest thing that Leight has to a castle, because the guest rooms and garret are contained within a tall turret. The Inn is the very sort that inspires ghosts and unspeakable phantoms to possess ones imagination - even mine. I suppose I cannot blame my naïve neighbors too much. If Im out in the evening, having a bite of dinner at our only restaurant, I try not to gaze up at that tower. As it darkens in the fading twilight, it slowly turns blacker than any sort of pitch.What is it about the place that makes me shudder, even though Im not so silly as to believe its haunted?How has it remained a dreamers refuge for more than two centuries, my ancestors toil notwithstanding?Why do I always see it in my own dreams, as it draws me like iron toward a magnet?Such mysteries are better left unsolved. What I must do is remain calm, and grounded in practicalities.The rumors state that no visitor to the Dreamers Inn has ever been a guest for more than one night. Even those travelers who have spent that brief length of time within its walls have departed without a word, in a mad frenzy of escape. Ive lived in Leight all my life, and have no reason to pay for a room when Im safe enough in my late fathers house. Nevertheless, I intend to stay not for one night, but three. I shall prove the chatter of my fellow citizens to be foolish gossip, once and for all, and bring more business to the Inn. I receive a share of its profits, being the only living descendant of its owners throughout the generations.Fathers pension is barely holding out, and with a bitter chill in the air, I need some more money for winter."]}

A Result and a Prologue1.From a private hospital for the insane near Providence, Rhode Island, there recently disappeared an exceedingly singular person. He bore the name of Charles Dexter Ward, and was placed under restraint most reluctantly by the grieving father who had watched his aberration grow from a mere eccentricity to a dark mania involving both a possibility of murderous tendencies and a profound and peculiar change in the apparent contents of his mind. Doctors confess themselves quite baffled by his case, since it presented oddities of a general physiological as well as psychological character.      In the first place, the patient seemed oddly older than his twenty-six years would warrant. Mental disturbance, it is true, will age one rapidly; but the face of this young man had taken on a subtle cast which only the very aged normally acquire. In the second place, his organic processes shewed a certain queerness of proportion which nothing in medical experience can parallel. Respiration and heart action had a baffling lack of symmetry; the voice was lost, so that no sounds above a whisper were possible; digestion was incredibly prolonged and minimised, and neural reactions to standard stimuli bore no relation at all to anything heretofore recorded, either normal or pathological. The skin had a morbid chill and dryness, and the cellular structure of the tissue seemed exaggeratedly coarse and loosely knit. Even a large olive birthmark on the right hip had disappeared, whilst there had formed on the chest a very peculiar mole or blackish spot of which no trace existed before. In general, all physicians agree that in Ward the processes of metabolism had become retarded to a degree beyond precedent.      Psychologically, too, Charles Ward was unique. His madness held no affinity to any sort recorded in even the latest and most exhaustive of treatises, and was conjoined to a mental force which would have made him a genius or a leader had it not been twisted into strange and grotesque forms. Dr. Willett, who was Wards family physician, affirms that the patients gross mental capacity, as gauged by his response to matters outside the sphere of his insanity, had actually increased since the seizure. Ward, it is true, was always a scholar and an antiquarian; but even his most brilliant early work did not shew the prodigious grasp and insight displayed during his last examinations by the alienists. It was, indeed, a difficult matter to obtain a legal commitment to the hospital, so powerful and lucid did the youths mind seem; and only on the evidence of others, and on the strength of many abnormal gaps in his stock of information as distinguished from his intelligence, was he finally placed in confinement. To the very moment of his vanishment he was an omnivorous reader and as great a conversationalist as his poor voice permitted; and shrewd observers, failing to foresee his escape, freely predicted that he would not be long in gaining his discharge from custody.      Only Dr. Willett, who brought Charles Ward into the world and had watched his growth of body and mind ever since, seemed frightened at the thought of his future freedom. He had had a terrible experience and had made a terrible discovery which he dared not reveal to his sceptical colleagues. Willett, indeed, presents a minor mystery all his own in his connexion with the case. He was the last to see the patient before his flight, and emerged from that final conversation in a state of mixed horror and relief which several recalled when Wards escape became known three hours later. That escape itself is one of the unsolved wonders of Dr. Waites hospital. A window open above a sheer drop of sixty feet could hardly explain it, yet after that talk with Willett the youth was undeniably gone. Willett himself has no public explanations to offer, though he seems strangely easier in mind than before the escape. Many, indeed, feel that he would like to say more if he thought any considerable number would believe him. He had found Ward in his room, but shortly after his departure the attendants knocked in vain. When they opened the door the patient was not there, and all they found was the open window with a chill April breeze blowing in a cloud of fine bluish-grey dust that almost choked them. True, the dogs howled some time before; but that was while Willett was still present, and they had caught nothing and shewn no disturbance later on. Wards father was told at once over the telephone, but he seemed more saddened than surprised. By the time Dr. Waite called in person, Dr. Willett had been talking with him, and both disavowed any knowledge or complicity in the escape. Only from certain closely confidential friends of Willett and the senior Ward have any clues been gained, and even these are too wildly fantastic for general credence. The one fact which remains is that up to the present time no trace of the missing madman has been unearthed.      Charles Ward was an antiquarian from infancy, no doubt gaining his taste from the venerable town around him, and from the relics of the past which filled every corner of his parents old mansion in Prospect Street on the crest of the hill. With the years his devotion to ancient things increased; so that history, genealogy, and the study of colonial architecture, furniture, and craftsmanship at length crowded everything else from his sphere of interests. These tastes are important to remember in considering his madness; for although they do not form its absolute nucleus, they play a prominent part in its superficial form. The gaps of information which the alienists noticed were all related to modern matters, and were invariably offset by a correspondingly excessive though outwardly concealed knowledge of bygone matters as brought out by adroit questioning; so that one would have fancied the patient literally transferred to a former age through some obscure sort of auto-hypnosis. The odd thing was that Ward seemed no longer interested in the antiquities he knew so well. He had, it appears, lost his regard for them through sheer familiarity; and all his final efforts were obviously bent toward mastering those common facts of the modern world which had been so totally and unmistakably expunged from his brain. That this wholesale deletion had occurred, he did his best to hide; but it was clear to all who watched him that his whole programme of reading and conversation was determined by a frantic wish to imbibe such knowledge of his own life and of the ordinary practical and cultural background of the twentieth century as ought to have been his by virtue of his birth in 1902 and his education in the schools of our own time. Alienists are now wondering how, in view of his vitally impaired range of data, the escaped patient manages to cope with the complicated world of today; the dominant opinion being that he is lying low in some humble and unexacting position till his stock of modern information can be brought up to the normal.      The beginning of Wards madness is a matter of dispute among alienists. Dr. Lyman, the eminent Boston authority, places it in 1919 or 1920, during the boys last year at the Moses Brown School, when he suddenly turned from the study of the past to the study of the occult, and refused to qualify for college on the ground that he had individual researches of much greater importance to make. This is certainly borne out by Wards altered habits at the time, especially by his continual search through town records and among old burying-grounds for a certain grave dug in 1771; the grave of an ancestor named Joseph Curwen, some of whose papers he professed to have found behind the panelling of a very old house in Olney Court, on Stampers Hill, which Curwen was known to have built and occupied. It is, broadly speaking, undeniable that the winter of 1919-20 saw a great change in Ward; whereby he abruptly stopped his general antiquarian pursuits and embarked on a desperate delving into occult subjects both at home and abroad, varied only by this strangely persistent search for his forefathers grave.      From this opinion, however, Dr. Willett substantially dissents; basing his verdict on his close and continuous knowledge of the patient, and on certain frightful investigations and discoveries which he made toward the last. Those investigations and discoveries have left their mark upon him; so that his voice trembles when he tells them, and his hand trembles when he tries to write of them. Willett admits that the change of 1919-20 would ordinarily appear to mark the beginning of a progressive decadence which culminated in the horrible and uncanny alienation of 1928; but believes from personal observation that a finer distinction must be made. Granting freely that the boy was always ill-balanced temperamentally, and prone to be unduly susceptible and enthusiastic in his responses to phenomena around him, he refuses to concede that the early alteration marked the actual passage from sanity to madness; crediting instead Wards own statement that he had discovered or rediscovered something whose effect on human thought was likely to be marvellous and profound. The true madness, he is certain, came with a later change; after the Curwen portrait and the ancient papers had been unearthed; after a trip to strange foreign places had been made, and some terrible invocations chanted under strange and secret circumstances; after certain answers to these invocations had been plainly indicated, and a frantic letter penned under agonising and inexplicable conditions; after the wave of vampirism and the ominous Pawtuxet gossip; and after the patients memory commenced to exclude contemporary images whilst his voice failed and his physical aspect underwent the subtle modification so many subsequently noticed.      It was only about this time, Willett points out with much acuteness, that the nightmare qualities became indubitably linked with Ward; and the doctor feels shudderingly sure that enough solid evidence exists to sustain the youths claim regarding his crucial discovery. In the first place, two workmen of high intelligence saw Joseph Curwens ancient papers found. Secondly, the boy once shewed Dr. Willett those papers and a page of the Curwen diary, and each of the documents had every appearance of genuineness. The hole where Ward claimed to have found them was long a visible reality, and Willett had a very convincing final glimpse of them in surroundings which can scarcely be believed and can never perhaps be proved. Then there were the mysteries and coincidences of the Orne and Hutchinson letters, and the problem of the Curwen penmanship and of what the detectives brought to light about Dr. Allen; these things, and the terrible message in mediaeval minuscules found in Willetts pocket when he gained consciousness after his shocking experience.      And most conclusive of all, there are the two hideous results which the doctor obtained from a certain pair of formulae during his final investigations; results which virtually proved the authenticity of the papers and of their monstrous implications at the same time that those papers were borne forever from human knowledge.2.      One must look back at Charles Wards earlier life as at something belonging as much to the past as the antiquities he loved so keenly. In the autumn of 1918, and with a considerable show of zest in the military training of the period, he had begun his junior year at the Moses Brown School, which lies very near his home. The old main building, erected in 1819, had always charmed his youthful antiquarian sense; and the spacious park in which the academy is set appealed to his sharp eye for landscape. His social activities were few; and his hours were spent mainly at home, in rambling walks, in his classes and drills, and in pursuit of antiquarian and genealogical data at the City Hall, the State House, the Public Library, the Athenaeum, the Historical Society, the John Carter Brown and John Hay Libraries of Brown University, and the newly opened Shepley Library in Benefit Street. One may picture him yet as he was in those days; tall, slim, and blond, with studious eyes and a slight stoop, dressed somewhat carelessly, and giving a dominant impression of harmless awkwardness rather than attractiveness.      His walks were always adventures in antiquity, during which he managed to recapture from the myriad relics of a glamorous old city a vivid and connected picture of the centuries before. His home was a great Georgian mansion atop the well-nigh precipitous hill that rises just east of the river; and from the rear windows of its rambling wings he could look dizzily out over all the clustered spires, domes, roofs, and skyscraper summits of the lower town to the purple hills of the countryside beyond. Here he was born, and from the lovely classic porch of the double-bayed brick facade his nurse had first wheeled him in his carriage; past the little white farmhouse of two hundred years before that the town had long ago overtaken, and on toward the stately colleges along the shady, sumptuous street, whose old square brick mansions and smaller wooden houses with narrow, heavy-columned Doric porches dreamed solid and exclusive amidst their generous yards and gardens.      He had been wheeled, too, along sleepy Congdon Street, one tier lower down on the steep hill, and with all its eastern homes on high terraces. The small wooden houses averaged a greater age here, for it was up this hill that the growing town had climbed; and in these rides he had imbibed something of the colour of a quaint colonial village. The nurse used to stop and sit on the benches of Prospect Terrace to chat with policemen; and one of the childs first memories was of the great westward sea of hazy roofs and domes and steeples and far hills which he saw one winter afternoon from that great railed embankment, all violet and mystic against a fevered, apocalyptic sunset of reds and golds and purples and curious greens. The vast marble dome of the State House stood out in massive silhouette, its crowning statue haloed fantastically by a break in one of the tinted stratus clouds that barred the flaming sky.      When he was larger his famous walks began; first with his impatiently dragged nurse, and then alone in dreamy meditation. Farther and farther down that almost perpendicular hill he would venture, each time reaching older and quainter levels of the ancient city. He would hesitate gingerly down vertical Jenckes Street with its bank walls and colonial gables to the shady Benefit Street corner, where before him was a wooden antique with an Ionic-pilastered pair of doorways, and beside him a prehistoric gambrel-roofer with a bit of primal farmyard remaining, and the great Judge Durfee house with its fallen vestiges of Georgian grandeur. It was getting to be a slum here; but the titan elms cast a restoring shadow over the place, and the boy used to stroll south past the long lines of the pre-Revolutionary homes with their great central chimneys and classic portals. On the eastern side they were set high over basements with railed double flights of stone steps, and the young Charles could picture them as they were when the street was new, and red heels and periwigs set off the painted pediments whose signs of wear were now becoming so visible.      Westward the hill dropped almost as steeply as above, down to the old \"Town Street\" that the founders had laid out at the rivers edge in 1636. Here ran innumerable little lanes with leaning, huddled houses of immense antiquity; and fascinated though he was, it was long before he dared to thread their archaic verticality for fear they would turn out a dream or a gateway to unknown terrors. He found it much less formidable to continue along Benefit Street past the iron fence of St. Johns hidden churchyard and the rear of the 1761 Colony House and the mouldering bulk of the Golden Ball Inn where Washington stopped. At Meeting Street - the successive Gaol Lane and King Street of other periods - he would look upward to the east and see the arched flight of steps to which the highway had to resort in climbing the slope, and downward to the west, glimpsing the old brick colonial schoolhouse that smiles across the road at the ancient Sign of Shakespears Head where the Providence Gazette and Country-Journal was printed before the Revolution. Then came the exquisite First Baptist Church of 1775, luxurious with its matchless Gibbs steeple, and the Georgian roofs and cupolas hovering by. Here and to the southward the neighbourhood became better, flowering at last into a marvellous group of early mansions; but still the little ancient lanes led off down the precipice to the west, spectral in their many-gabled archaism and dipping to a riot of iridescent decay where the wicked old waterfront recalls its proud East India days amidst polyglot vice and squalor, rotting wharves, and blear-eyed ship-chandleries, with such surviving alley names as Packet, Bullion, Gold, Silver, Coin, Doubloon, Sovereign, Guilder, Dollar, Dime, and Cent.      Sometimes, as he grew taller and more adventurous, young Ward would venture down into this maelstrom of tottering houses, broken transoms, tumbling steps, twisted balustrades, swarthy faces, and nameless odours; winding from South Main to South Water, searching out the docks where the bay and sound steamers still touched, and returning northward at this lower level past the steep-roofed 1816 warehouses and the broad square at the Great Bridge, where the 1773 Market House still stands firm on its ancient arches. In that square he would pause to drink in the bewildering beauty of the old town as it rises on its eastward bluff, decked with its two Georgian spires and crowned by the vast new Christian Science dome as London is crowned by St. Pauls. He liked mostly to reach this point in the late afternoon, when the slanting sunlight touches the Market House and the ancient hill roofs and belfries with gold, and throws magic around the dreaming wharves where Providence Indiamen used to ride at anchor. After a long look he would grow almost dizzy with a poets love for the sight, and then he would scale the slope homeward in the dusk past the old white church and up the narrow precipitous ways where yellow gleams would begin to peep out in small-paned windows and through fanlights set high over double flights of steps with curious wrought-iron railings.      At other times, and in later years, he would seek for vivid contrasts; spending half a walk in the crumbling colonial regions northwest of his home, where the hill drops to the lower eminence of Stampers Hill with its ghetto and negro quarter clustering round the place where the Boston stage coach used to start before the Revolution, and the other half in the gracious southerly realm about George, Benevolent, Power, and Williams Streets, where the old slope holds unchanged the fine estates and bits of walled garden and steep green lane in which so many fragrant memories linger. These rambles, together with the diligent studies which accompanied them, certainly account for a large amount of the antiquarian lore which at last crowded the modern world from Charles Wards mind; and illustrate the mental soil upon which fell, in that fateful winter of 1919-20, the seeds that came to such strange and terrible fruition.      Dr. Willett is certain that, up to this ill-omened winter of first change, Charles Wards antiquarianism was free from every trace of the morbid. Graveyards held for him no particular attraction beyond their quaintness and historic value, and of anything like violence or savage instinct he was utterly devoid. Then, by insidious degrees, there appeared to develop a curious sequel to one of his genealogical triumphs of the year before; when he had discovered among his maternal ancestors a certain very long-lived man named Joseph Curwen, who had come from Salem in March of 1692, and about whom a whispered series of highly peculiar and disquieting stories clustered.      Wards great-great-grandfather Welcome Potter had in 1785 married a certain \"Ann Tillinghast, daughter of Mrs. Eliza, daughter to Capt. James Tillinghast\", of whose paternity the family had preserved no trace. Late in 1918, whilst examining a volume of original town records in manuscript, the young genealogist encountered an entry describing a legal change of name, by which in 1772 a Mrs. Eliza Curwen, widow of Joseph Curwen, resumed, along with her seven-year-old daughter Ann, her maiden name of Tillinghast; on the ground that her Husbands name was become a publick Reproach by Reason of what was knowne after his Decease; the which confirming an antient common Rumour, tho not to be credited by a loyall Wife till so proven as to be wholely past Doubting. This entry came to light upon the accidental separation of two leaves which had been carefully pasted together and treated as one by a laboured revision of the page numbers.      It was at once clear to Charles Ward that he had indeed discovered a hitherto unknown great-great-great-grandfather. The discovery doubly excited him because he had already heard vague reports and seen scattered allusions relating to this person; about whom there remained so few publicly available records, aside from those becoming public only in modern times, that it almost seemed as if a conspiracy had existed to blot him from memory. What did appear, moreover, was of such a singular and provocative nature that one could not fail to imagine curiously what it was that the colonial recorders were so anxious to conceal and forget; or to suspect that the deletion had reasons all too valid.      Before this, Ward had been content to let his romancing about old Joseph Curwen remain in the idle stage; but having discovered his own relationship to this apparently \"hushed-up\" character, he proceeded to hunt out as systematically as possible whatever he might find concerning him. In this excited quest he eventually succeeded beyond his highest expectations; for old letters, diaries, and sheaves of unpublished memoirs in cobwebbed Providence garrets and elsewhere yielded many illuminating passages which their writers had not thought it worth their while to destroy. One important sidelight came from a point as remote as New York, where some Rhode Island colonial correspondence was stored in the Museum at Fraunces Tavern. The really crucial thing, though, and what in Dr. Willetts opinion formed the definite source of Wards undoing, was the matter found in August 1919 behind the panelling of the crumbling house in Olney Court. It was that, beyond a doubt, which opened up those black vistas whose end was deeper than the pit.", "IX.Friday morning Armitage, Rice, and Morgan set out by motor for Dunwich, arriving at the village about one in the afternoon. The day was pleasant, but even in the brightest sunlight a kind of quiet dread and portent seemed to hover about the strangely domed hills and the deep, shadowy ravines of the stricken region. Now and then on some mountain-top a gaunt circle of stones could be glimpsed against the sky. From the air of hushed fright at Osborn’s store they knew something hideous had happened, and soon learned of the annihilation of the Elmer Frye house and family. Throughout that afternoon they rode around Dunwich; questioning the natives concerning all that had occurred, and seeing for themselves with rising pangs of horror the drear Frye ruins with their lingering traces of the tarry stickiness, the blasphemous tracks in the Frye yard, the wounded Seth Bishop cattle, and the enormous swaths of disturbed vegetation in various places. The trail up and down Sentinel Hill seemed to Armitage of almost cataclysmic significance, and he looked long at the sinister altar-like stone on the summit.      At length the visitors, apprised of a party of State Police which had come from Aylesbury that morning in response to the first telephone reports of the Frye tragedy, decided to seek out the officers and compare notes as far as practicable. This, however, they found more easily planned than performed; since no sign of the party could be found in any direction. There had been five of them in a car, but now the car stood empty near the ruins in the Frye yard. The natives, all of whom had talked with the policemen, seemed at first as perplexed as Armitage and his companions. Then old Sam Hutchins thought of something and turned pale, nudging Fred Farr and pointing to the dank, deep hollow that yawned close by.      “Gawd,” he gasped, “I telled ’em not ter go daown into the glen, an’ I never thought nobody’d dew it with them tracks an’ that smell an’ the whippoorwills a-screechin’ daown thar in the dark o’ noonday. . . .”      A cold shudder ran through natives and visitors alike, and every ear seemed strained in a kind of instinctive, unconscious listening. Armitage, now that he had actually come upon the horror and its monstrous work, trembled with the responsibility he felt to be his. Night would soon fall, and it was then that the mountainous blasphemy lumbered upon its eldritch course. Negotium perambulans in tenebris. . . . The old librarian rehearsed the formulae he had memorised, and clutched the paper containing the alternative one he had not memorised. He saw that his electric flashlight was in working order. Rice, beside him, took from a valise a metal sprayer of the sort used in combating insects; whilst Morgan uncased the big-game rifle on which he relied despite his colleague’s warnings that no material weapon would be of help.      Armitage, having read the hideous diary, knew painfully well what kind of a manifestation to expect; but he did not add to the fright of the Dunwich people by giving any hints or clues. He hoped that it might be conquered without any revelation to the world of the monstrous thing it had escaped. As the shadows gathered, the natives commenced to disperse homeward, anxious to bar themselves indoors despite the present evidence that all human locks and bolts were useless before a force that could bend trees and crush houses when it chose. They shook their heads at the visitors’ plan to stand guard at the Frye ruins near the glen; and as they left, had little expectancy of ever seeing the watchers again.      There were rumblings under the hills that night, and the whippoorwills piped threateningly. Once in a while a wind, sweeping up out of Cold Spring Glen, would bring a touch of ineffable foetor to the heavy night air; such a foetor as all three of the watchers had smelled once before, when they stood above a dying thing that had passed for fifteen years and a half as a human being. But the looked-for terror did not appear. Whatever was down there in the glen was biding its time, and Armitage told his colleagues it would be suicidal to try to attack it in the dark.      Morning came wanly, and the night-sounds ceased. It was a grey, bleak day, with now and then a drizzle of rain; and heavier and heavier clouds seemed to be piling themselves up beyond the hills to the northwest. The men from Arkham were undecided what to do. Seeking shelter from the increasing rainfall beneath one of the few undestroyed Frye outbuildings, they debated the wisdom of waiting, or of taking the aggressive and going down into the glen in quest of their nameless, monstrous quarry. The downpour waxed in heaviness, and distant peals of thunder sounded from far horizons. Sheet lightning shimmered, and then a forky bolt flashed near at hand, as if descending into the accursed glen itself. The sky grew very dark, and the watchers hoped that the storm would prove a short, sharp one followed by clear weather.      It was still gruesomely dark when, not much over an hour later, a confused babel of voices sounded down the road. Another moment brought to view a frightened group of more than a dozen men, running, shouting, and even whimpering hysterically. Someone in the lead began sobbing out words, and the Arkham men started violently when those words developed a coherent form.      “Oh, my Gawd, my Gawd,” the voice choked out. “It’s a-goin’ agin, an’ this time by day! It’s aout—it’s aout an’ a-movin’ this very minute, an’ only the Lord knows when it’ll be on us all!”      The speaker panted into silence, but another took up his message.      “Nigh on a haour ago Zeb Whateley here heerd the ’phone a-ringin’, an’ it was Mis’ Corey, George’s wife, that lives daown by the junction. She says the hired boy Luther was aout drivin’ in the caows from the storm arter the big bolt, when he see all the trees a-bendin’ at the maouth o’ the glen—opposite side ter this—an’ smelt the same awful smell like he smelt when he faound the big tracks las’ Monday mornin’. An’ she says he says they was a swishin’, lappin’ saound, more nor what the bendin’ trees an’ bushes could make, an’ all on a suddent the trees along the rud begun ter git pushed one side, an’ they was a awful stompin’ an’ splashin’ in the mud. But mind ye, Luther he didn’t see nothin’ at all, only just the bendin’ trees an’ underbrush.      “Then fur ahead where Bishop’s Brook goes under the rud he heerd a awful creakin’ an’ strainin’ on the bridge, an’ says he could tell the saound o’ wood a-startin’ to crack an’ split. An’ all the whiles he never see a thing, only them trees an’ bushes a-bendin’. An’ when the swishin’ saound got very fur off—on the rud towards Wizard Whateley’s an’ Sentinel Hill—Luther he had the guts ter step up whar he’d heerd it furst an’ look at the graound. It was all mud an’ water, an’ the sky was dark, an’ the rain was wipin’ aout all tracks abaout as fast as could be; but beginnin’ at the glen maouth, whar the trees had moved, they was still some o’ them awful prints big as bar’ls like he seen Monday.”      At this point the first excited speaker interrupted.      “But that ain’t the trouble naow—that was only the start. Zeb here was callin’ folks up an’ everybody was a-listenin’ in when a call from Seth Bishop’s cut in. His haousekeeper Sally was carryin’ on fit ter kill—she’d jest seed the trees a-bendin’ beside the rud, an’ says they was a kind o’ mushy saound, like a elephant puffin’ an’ treadin’, a-headin’ fer the haouse. Then she up an’ spoke suddent of a fearful smell, an’ says her boy Cha’ncey was a-screamin’ as haow it was jest like what he smelt up to the Whateley rewins Monday mornin’. An’ the dogs was all barkin’ an’ whinin’ awful.      “An’ then she let aout a turrible yell, an’ says the shed daown the rud had jest caved in like the storm hed blowed it over, only the wind wa’n’t strong enough to dew that. Everybody was a-listenin’, an’ we could hear lots o’ folks on the wire a-gaspin’. All to onct Sally she yelled agin, an’ says the front yard picket fence hed just crumbled up, though they wa’n’t no sign o’ what done it. Then everybody on the line could hear Cha’ncey an’ ol’ Seth Bishop a-yellin’ tew, an’ Sally was shriekin’ aout that suthin’ heavy hed struck the haouse—not lightnin’ nor nothin’, but suthin’ heavy agin the front, that kep’ a-launchin’ itself agin an’ agin, though ye couldn’t see nothin’ aout the front winders. An’ then . . . an’ then . . .”      Lines of fright deepened on every face; and Armitage, shaken as he was, had barely poise enough to prompt the speaker.      “An’ then . . . Sally she yelled aout, ’O help, the haouse is a-cavin’ in’ . . . an’ on the wire we could hear a turrible crashin’, an’ a hull flock o’ screamin’ . . . jest like when Elmer Frye’s place was took, only wuss. . . .”      The man paused, and another of the crowd spoke.      “That’s all—not a saound nor squeak over the ’phone arter that. Jest still-like. We that heerd it got aout Fords an’ wagons an’ raounded up as many able-bodied menfolks as we could git, at Corey’s place, an’ come up here ter see what yew thought best ter dew. Not but what I think it’s the Lord’s jedgment fer our iniquities, that no mortal kin ever set aside.”      Armitage saw that the time for positive action had come, and spoke decisively to the faltering group of frightened rustics.      “We must follow it, boys.” He made his voice as reassuring as possible. “I believe there’s a chance of putting it out of business. You men know that those Whateleys were wizards—well, this thing is a thing of wizardry, and must be put down by the same means. I’ve seen Wilbur Whateley’s diary and read some of the strange old books he used to read; and I think I know the right kind of spell to recite to make the thing fade away. Of course, one can’t be sure, but we can always take a chance. It’s invisible—I knew it would be—but there’s a powder in this long-distance sprayer that might make it shew up for a second. Later on we’ll try it. It’s a frightful thing to have alive, but it isn’t as bad as what Wilbur would have let in if he’d lived longer. You’ll never know what the world has escaped. Now we’ve only this one thing to fight, and it can’t multiply. It can, though, do a lot of harm; so we mustn’t hesitate to rid the community of it.      “We must follow it—and the way to begin is to go to the place that has just been wrecked. Let somebody lead the way—I don’t know your roads very well, but I’ve an idea there might be a shorter cut across lots. How about it?”      The men shuffled about a moment, and then Earl Sawyer spoke softly, pointing with a grimy finger through the steadily lessening rain.      “I guess ye kin git to Seth Bishop’s quickest by cuttin’ acrost the lower medder here, wadin’ the brook at the low place, an’ climbin’ through Carrier’s mowin’ and the timber-lot beyont. That comes aout on the upper rud mighty nigh Seth’s—a leetle t’other side.”      Armitage, with Rice and Morgan, started to walk in the direction indicated; and most of the natives followed slowly. The sky was growing lighter, and there were signs that the storm had worn itself away. When Armitage inadvertently took a wrong direction, Joe Osborn warned him and walked ahead to shew the right one. Courage and confidence were mounting; though the twilight of the almost perpendicular wooded hill which lay toward the end of their short cut, and among whose fantastic ancient trees they had to scramble as if up a ladder, put these qualities to a severe test.      At length they emerged on a muddy road to find the sun coming out. They were a little beyond the Seth Bishop place, but bent trees and hideously unmistakable tracks shewed what had passed by. Only a few moments were consumed in surveying the ruins just around the bend. It was the Frye incident all over again, and nothing dead or living was found in either of the collapsed shells which had been the Bishop house and barn. No one cared to remain there amidst the stench and tarry stickiness, but all turned instinctively to the line of horrible prints leading on toward the wrecked Whateley farmhouse and the altar-crowned slopes of Sentinel Hill.      As the men passed the site of Wilbur Whateley’s abode they shuddered visibly, and seemed again to mix hesitancy with their zeal. It was no joke tracking down something as big as a house that one could not see, but that had all the vicious malevolence of a daemon. Opposite the base of Sentinel Hill the tracks left the road, and there was a fresh bending and matting visible along the broad swath marking the monster’s former route to and from the summit.      Armitage produced a pocket telescope of considerable power and scanned the steep green side of the hill. Then he handed the instrument to Morgan, whose sight was keener. After a moment of gazing Morgan cried out sharply, passing the glass to Earl Sawyer and indicating a certain spot on the slope with his finger. Sawyer, as clumsy as most non-users of optical devices are, fumbled a while; but eventually focussed the lenses with Armitage’s aid. When he did so his cry was less restrained than Morgan’s had been.      “Gawd almighty, the grass an’ bushes is a-movin’! It’s a-goin’ up—slow-like—creepin’ up ter the top this minute, heaven only knows what fur!”      Then the germ of panic seemed to spread among the seekers. It was one thing to chase the nameless entity, but quite another to find it. Spells might be all right—but suppose they weren’t? Voices began questioning Armitage about what he knew of the thing, and no reply seemed quite to satisfy. Everyone seemed to feel himself in close proximity to phases of Nature and of being utterly forbidden, and wholly outside the sane experience of mankind."]}
{"id": "EN053", "pair": ["Heavens not enoughIf when Im there I dont remember you...The words came unbidden to Torren-Wraeths mind. The line was from an old song from the soundtrack of an old Japanese anime that had confused and depressed the hell out of him. He shook his head, Heavens Not Enough, Steve Conte, Wolfs Rain soundtrack, No... there had been two soundtracks for that series, this was the first song on the second. Why wasnt it called Wolves Rain? He thought, trying to dispel the sad song, but it played on, and he was even singing softly toward the songs end...Cause I couldnt cryCause I turned awayCouldnt see the scoreDidnt know the painOf leaving yesterday really far behindin another lifein another dreamBy a different namegave it all away for a memory and a quiet lieand I felt the face Of the cold tonightStill dont know the scoreBut I know the painOf leaving everything really far behind ...Thus distracted, he did not see Dahlman.The sorcerer was a servant of the He Who Gnaws in The Darkness. Azathoth was neither ally nor enemy to Cthulhu, he was actually his Great-Grandfather having sired both Yog-Sothoth and Shub-Niggurath, who had sired Nug and Yeb, Nug being Cthulhus parent by parthogenesis. Azathoths worshipers, however, tended to be madmen in the truest sense. He was a mindless entity, neither desiring nor rewarding worship. Some of the gods who danced round and round his throne often took it upon themselves to accept his worship and grant gifts in his behalf. Especially Nyarlathotep...The Outer Gods were the key. Humans were a weak species, helpless in the face of even the least of The Great Old Ones. But by learning, by studying the Outer Gods, by utilizing their power, a human could assume a form of divinity themselves. For decades Dahlman had faithfully studied the ancient texts, The Book of Eibon, The Necronomicon, The Book of Iod, and he had learned to harness the power of those who lurked mindless and blind beyond the thin veil of reality. And now he would prove his worth, he would bring down an immortal, the child of a god...A bolt of lightning shook Torren-Wraeth from his revery, it barely hurt, but he could tell it was not natural. He turned to see a black-clad figuring closing in upon him, and erected a Deflect Harm even as the human struck out with Fist of Yog-Sothoth. \"Okay, now youre annoying me.\" Torren-Wraeth lashed out with Implant Fear, hoping to avoid having to actually kill this irrational attacker. He disliked sorcerers, but he also disliked having to harm people. But the madman had cast Deflect Harm upon himself, and, thus protected, struck back with The Dread Curse of Azathoth. Torren-Wraeth reeled, Now that hurt! Enraged, Torren-Wraeth physically rushed the sorcerer, ignoring the protective amulet the man held out, and punched him square in the nose, breaking it. Distracted by the pain, Dahlman fell before Implant Fear.Dahlmans mind was instantly overwhelmed with unimaginable fear and he turned to flee, all spells forgotten in his terror, only to run into a golden monstrosity streaking toward him in the dawning sky. He called frantically upon his gods to save him. But these were not benevolent gods, they were fickle, and enjoyed granting lesser beings great power, just to have the pleasure of snatching it away. His gods deserted him mid-flight, his skin shriveled and shrank tight against his bones as he aged in seconds. The capricious Outer Gods no doubt laughed as their former ward fell into the sea, and was immediately set upon by sharks.Torren-Wraeth and Tek watched impassively as the dying sorcerer fell into the sea.\"Who was that?\"\"I have no idea.\"\"And I thought you were in trouble.\"\"Sorry.\"\"You do get in the strangest situations.\" Tek observed wryly.\"Sorry.\"Youve made me late, you know.\"\"Sorry about that.\"\"Its okay, I could use the break. A word of advice, never marry a woman with five mouths.\"Both Tek and Torren-Wraeth laughed.Ho Fong arched an eyebrow as he saw the disheveled Torren-Wraeth accompanying Lord Tektaktequataquarl. Hed seen him before, of course, he occasionally visited alongside Tek, though his distaste for the ritual sacrifices of human beings was clearly evident. Fortunately, no such events were scheduled. \"Are you alright, Lord Torren-Wraeth?\" He knew better than to call him simply Torren or Wraeth. \"Ill be all right, Master Ho,\" Torren-Wraeth said with perfect Chinese courtesy, \"But I would be most grateful for a place to rest for a while.\" Ho Fong smiled, \"Of course,\" he turned, \"Ping, take lord Torren-Wraeth to one of the guest areas and provide him with whatever refreshments he requires.\" A youngish monk, dressed in the standard yellow and black silk, stepped forward and led Torren-Wraeth deeper into the monastery.It was instantly obvious to Torren-Wraeth that Ping was not Chinese, at least, not in the ethnic sense. He was one of the dreaded Tcho-Tcho people, descendants of toad-like creatures created by the Great Old One Chaugnar Faugn and human cultists. The Tcho-Tcho had an evil reputation, one well earned. The vast majority of them served the Great Old Ones, and many practiced cannibalism. There were exceptions, of course, not all Tcho-Tcho were evil or insane, but those individuals were usually outcasts, hated and sometimes even hunted by their own people. As they walked, Torren-Wraeth halted for a moment before an idol of carved black stone. It was well-crafted and incredibly detailed, lean muscled and lanky, wings extended, the webbed hands held palm up like a divine supplicant, the curving trunk-mouth lifted upward as if it were sounding a call. A call to Death itself, for this was Shugoran, The Herald of Death, worshiped and feared by the Tcho-Tcho people. Ping knelt reverently then hurried Torren-Wraeth into a nearby chamber.The scent of Black Lotus was thick in the air as the monks shut the great copper door behind Tek. \"You really shouldnt smoke you know,\" he said casually, \"Terrible for the lungs...\" The Bloated Woman rose from her cushions, \"Only if you are a mortal, which I am not.\" Tek smiled, then shed his semblance of humanity, becoming a writhing, shapeless mass of golden flesh, golden tentacles, golden eyes and pearly white fangs. \"What of our child?\" Several mouths spoke at once. The Goddess came closer with a grace unfitting such an obese creature. \"Nothing can harm our offspring.\" \"How long, do you think?\" The Bloated Woman stopped, apparently this visit was for business, not pleasure. \"It is impossible to tell. I have born some children within days of conception, and others within centuries.\" She sensed a slight jealous possessiveness on the part of the Hastur-Spawn, he wanted her as his sole mate, an amusing and archaic notion, not often seen in a True-Blood. The fact that he knew she had devoured most of the former lovers did not apparently assuage this unseemly feeling. \"I feel that this one will be born within a month or two...\" She grinned horribly with all five mouths, \"How has your father reacted?\" \"Our child will be welcome in Carcosa.\" Hastur, in truth, was somewhat worried, fearing that the child would be another avatar of Nyarlathotep, that the Crawling Chaos would use the child as yet another form in which to manifest itself. In other words, he feared that Nyarlathotep would give birth to itself...For all the vile practices that went on in the Monastery of The Bloated Woman, it was a beautiful place, richly decorated in jade and silver, gold and silk. Yellow and black, every strand of silk in the monastery was either yellow or black. The yellow made for a much friendlier environment than the dark, ominous stones of RLyeh. The Goddess favored those colors, for some reason. Torren-Wraeth remembered something Goro had once said. Among his people and several other Asian cultures, yellow was the color of mourning. Black meant death and mourning in the West, yellow filled that role in the East. Was it intentional? Probably, but he was a guest, and it would be rude to question his hosts. He changed from his slightly charred clothing into the yellow and black robes that had been kindly provided him and stepped out into the hallway. There he saw Ping once again kneeling before Shugoran.", "Spoonbill Village, Northernmost Quang Bin Province, SRVJune 29, 2011As the two young adults stared at each other, nothing but shock registered in either of their brains. Not the stares of the villagers nor of Josephs classmates affected them in their surprise. For Joseph, the shock was mixed with relief at finding his girlfriend safe, concern about his own impending fate as the main course and a strange confusion about what the heck was going on. For Marie, it was the sheer shock of actually seeing her boyfriend here and her puzzlement at the reason why that added to her numb bewilderment, not to mention the fear for his life at what might happen next.As the shock broke, she knew that she had to act. And since the village chief was here...\"You cannot sacrifice this man! His family are allies are of my parents, his parents are involved in our business. If anything happens to him, calamity will come upon us all!\" Demanding such things of the chieftain might have been rude, presumptuous and even insulting, but everything she said was the truth. If Joseph died, things would go down the toilet very quickly.Before the men could answer back, the crashing of a great bronze gong echoed over the crowd and all heads turned towards the source of the cacophony, the temple. Coming down the steps was a red lacquered palanquin with red curtains. Four men in deeply-hooded red robes supported the wooden structure, its bracing poles upon their shoulders. As they reached the courtyard proper, one of the warriors who had exited the large house went up to the palanquin, distinguished from the others by leather shoes on his feet, a broad circlet of gold around his black head-wrap and a single pheasant tail feather standing erect at the forefront of this headdress. Joseph could distinguish some sort of conversation happening, the words too quiet to make out. For several tense seconds he, Marie, his classmates and his professor waited for what would happen.What happened was that from this man, the villages hereditary chief, the order was given for them to be spared... for now. Another order was given to separate them and hold them in isolation until a final decision could be made.As Joseph was carried away into a side street, he could almost glimpse Marie following the palanquin into the Temple, including his Professor, still sitting in his basket.Several Hours LaterJoseph could never fully recall all of the things that he had pondered in those hours, sitting with his hands and feet bound, alone in that dark storehouse, smelling of rice and preserved vegetables. He had found Marie and as he had suspected for a number of years, she apparently belonged to a semi-unique culture of Vietic speakers in her purported homeland of the Annamite Range. What came as a surprise was that they apparently, if the few bits of coherent speech he had heard were any indication, practiced some sort of ritualized homicide and may well be inclined toward the consumption of \"long pork\"... and at the moment, that could include him.Eventually the door opened and soft, yellow light flooded the room, illuminating bags of rice and strings of hanging vegetables. In the doorway was Marie, carrying a paper covered lantern in one hand, a bronze bowl in the other and now hat-less. As he had briefly noticed earlier, the muscles on her limbs now had a definition to them that hadnt existed back in Glaston, her frame slightly more lean than the apprentice cook that he remembered. She was dressed just as she had been before, was still tattooed everywhere he could see and, as she she came over to where he was sitting, the light in the lantern seemed more like... fireflies than any kind of flame.\"So... nice place you have here.\" He hoped that starting slow could take some of the edge off the dangerous situation in which he now faced himself.\"Yeah... it is nice, I guess.\" Marie put the bowl (now seen to be carrying water) and the lantern on the ground beside him and knelt to untie his bonds. \"Im sorry that you got dragged into this. When I borrowed that record... I had no idea that...\" She closed her eyes and sighed in a way that, to Joseph, made the tattoos on her face dance almost... alluringly. \"Theres a lot that I just couldnt tell you when we were younger. My people are used to hiding... maybe tooused to it by now. I want to tell you so much, but I... I dont know where to begin.\"\"Then start from the beginning. That always seems to be how its done in the movies.\" Rubbing his wrists and ankles to get the circulation back, Joseph wondered just what he was going to hear.What he heard was everythingabout her people, the stories she had enraptured Cora with plus a whole lot of other stuff, fantastic and gruesome in equal measure. The human sacrifice, the ritual cannibalism, the intermittent persecution by Chinese, Champa, Viet and French over the last two thousand years... nothing was left out. As he sipped water from the bowl, she described how her peoples ancestors had been Au Lac refugees from the Red River Valley, driven south into the mountains by the invading Qin Chinese. On the edge of total starvation, they had been saved when a spirit animal, a black water buffalo cow with a seemingly endless number of calves trailing behind, had emerged from the highland jungle at the chanting of animist shamans travelling with the group.Behind those spectral buffalo had emerged their wonder and salvation: men in red robes with the legs of goats, monks from a far, high land called Leng. These strange people, who called themselves Shugoran, had taught this diverse group of farmers, mountain peoples, priests, urbanites and servants many useful magics: how to grow up to twelve crops of rice per year, how to draw water and metal from the earth, how to commune with the forces of the universe and not annoy them too severely, how to pass perfect memories from father to son, how to ensure the fertility of people, livestock and game and how to armor a persons skin so as to stop any blade or spear or arrow or sling stone.It was this last spell, combined with the requirement in orthodox Shugoran magic for Human (or similar) sacrifice and cannibalism that brought on the next mess. When the Qin Dynasty collapsed under the weight of the first emperors paranoia and his successors incompetence, suicide and the resultant power struggle, the men of the new \"Leng Viet\" decided to press their advantage. They launched a guerrilla campaign in an attempt to drive the Trieu Dynasty, with its mixed nobility of native southerners and Han Chinese, out of the Red River valley and establish a new native state.Over the next hundred years, men raided trade routes and army barracks in the guise of screaming, bare-chested, tattooed (associated with bandits and convicts by the Chinese) savages, dragging captives off into the night or the forest in order to sacrifice them for either civilian or military magic. When they eventually lost their \"War of the Bandits\" (from the threefold causes of not getting any local nobility on their side, of terrifying the pants off their Viet kinsmen with their ferocity and the rumours of their religion and by the sheer weight of the eventual re-invasion by the armies of the Han Dynasty) they fled deep into the mountains of the West and South, being chided by the last of the original, goat-legged sorcerers for their foolish, ill-planned ambitions. From then, they had remained hidden and relatively peaceful, though remembered in whispered folk-tales as vicious, man-eating monsters.After Marie had finished. Joseph sat in silence for a few minutes, digesting what he had just heard. The whole thing about magic was a bit.. hard to swallow. However, his own eyes had seen things that most would say were impossible. \"You dont... you dont hate me now, do you?\" Marie suddenly asked, her face awash in a worried panic, perhaps the culmination of every bout of anxiety she had ever experienced when Joseph had began edging onto the subject of her peoples true nature. So much worry, so much fear and one wrong move now could break her heart.For once, just once, he initiated the kiss this time.\"Does that answer your question?\" As they pulled apart, he could see that most of her anxieties had melted away. \"And... I hesitate to mention this, but about your parents restaurant...\" He stopped when he saw her face, now an annoyed, knowing grimace that indicated that the next words out of his mouth should be chosen very carefully. \"Uh... about the chicken, beef and pork they used. Was any of it... officiallysacrificed?\"Maries grimace let up. \"You need a priest to do anything official, and my parents are from farming families. Dont worry, we never served anyone up as the main course.\" She actually began to smile as she stood upright.\"Alright... but speaking of the main course, what about...\" Joseph gulped nervously. \"Me? Am I still going to be barbecue or did you actually convince anyone otherwise?\"The next news out of Maries mouth was welcome indeed. \"I didnt, but your professor won your life and those of the others after he talked with our Chief Priest. If Im right, he and the rest of your team should be at the house of my paternal grandparents. Who arethey, anyway?\"\"My classmates. The Anthropology department at Miskatonic organized this trip with Professor Andover and a couple of us volunteered. \" Still holding the bowl, Joseph began standing, his limbs still stiff and numb from hours of sitting. Despite this discomfort and the twitching shocks that came when blood began flowing free again, he followed her out the door, though not before taking and slinging a bag of rice over his shoulder at her asking, along with a braid of garlic bulbs and a small box of dried pork on a cord.During his captivity, Joseph had been held in one of the storehouses by the river, a short way north of the village. Now, in the waning light of dusk, he and Marie made their way back on the path that wove through vegetable gardens and pig-pens until they reached the outlying houses. Through narrow alleys between house stilts and below the sounds of evening meals being eaten, past dogs and pigs drowsing in the under-crofts and along the great outer wall of the temple they traveled before moving into the main square and down the main thoroughfare.\"It should be just after this next left, right across from the bronze-smith.\" As they walked along, they came to an intersection. On their right was a large house facing the street, belonging to the village bronze-smith and acting as a shop, a workplace and his family home. Across the main street from that house was a side street, lined by mostly smaller houses but each of them with soft lights in their windows. A few houses in, Marie led Joseph up the stairs of one house where familiar voices were laughing and making merry, including one brash female voice in particular that Joseph had come to know well.As Marie lay down the lantern on the porch and opened the door, the voices became louder and clearer. When they entered, everyone was already seated (or at least kneeling). Albert and Malone were trading stories of their brief imprisonment and what they had seen, while Tracy was working her way through a bowl of green tea, apparently trying to cajole her way into the rice whiskey. Professor Andover was making small conversation with an old village man sitting at the head of the table who was wearing the brown jacket and skirt combo that was so common. Also at the table was a younger man and his wife, maybe a little older than Maries parents, along with two teenage sons who had not yet received their tattooing. Some ways from the table, an elderly woman worked at a hearth lined with stone and brick, stoking a carefully controlled charcoal fire.Everyone looked up at the new arrivals. The first to speak was the old man who had been talking to the professor, telling Marie to bring the rice and other ingredients over to the charcoal hearth so the evening meal could begin and then for them to sit down. After that was done, Joseph noticed that people were looking at him.Apparently, it was time to make introductions.\"Joseph, Id like you to meet my family on my fathers side.\" After explaining that few of them could understand any English at all, Marie started introducing them. First came the old man, now identified as her paternal grandfather. Her grandmother, his wife, was the woman starting tending the fire at the hearth, her gray hair in an elaborate bun at the back of the head held together with a set of jade hairpins and wearing a long, black dress, similar to the garment that Marie had worn at the performance. Maries uncle Huy and his wife An sat across from the Miskatonic students and beside them sat Cuong and Thao, their two sons...Only two?\"Damn, the Kids!\" Marie had been so busy with her boyfriend that the absence her younger cousins had escaped her until now. She got back up and went to the door, opened it and called down the street for them to get in the house now and try not to spill the water they were carrying. As she returned to where she had been kneeling, many hurried footsteps were heard coming up the outside stairs and the door opened again as five children entered as a crowd. The oldest, a girl who was perhaps eleven years old, was carrying two bronze pails of water in her hands while the second oldest, a boy of maybe ten, was carrying two more.In fact, all the kids, which included two more boys and another girl, seemed to each be about a year apart down to a little boy of about seven years old. \"Big families the norm around here?\" Joseph asked his girlfriend as the water was transferred to cooking vessels and the ingredients collected.Marie shrugged. \"More or less: most farming families have at least three kids nowadays but the norm used to be around five around a century ago. This family is weird both ways: My uncle and aunt for having so many and my parents for just having me.\" Of course, sooner or later this casual reminiscing had to end. \"So, Professor...\" Tracy began, consciously deciding to get back on topic from the revery the two had been involved in. \"You Said that you had something to tell us, about the ultimate purpose of this expedition?\"Neville Andover smiled the way that someone delivering a great and terrible revelation does. \"As a matter of fact, I did.\" He motioned towards Malone, who was now extremely attentive. \"This is Malone Roberts; for the last year he has been playing the part of my student, but he is far more than that. He is my assistant, my cohort... my protege in the context of the agency I work for. Tell me...\" He seemed to direct this as every member of the audience (save Malone) who could speak English. \"Have any of you heard of Delta Green?\"\"Whats that? Something in the Marine Corps?\" It had soundedlike an innocent question from Ms. Williams, but Joseph had shared a class, study groups and cram sessions with her for many months, and could recognize the first signs of building stress and panic when he saw them. They were amazingly similar to the signs that Marie herself had shown, with the difference of gripping objects such as a table edge with white-knuckle intensity now apparent.\"Its surprising that you havent heard of it, considering the contacts in your community and the agencies reputation for... extreme measuresbefore 1960.\" Now Andover turned to Albert Noyes. \"Perhaps you have some notion of it... or its partner agency, Majestic 12. It is quite amazing work theyre doing on the Yuggoth Project, especially on fungi.\" This seemed like it was crammed with potential clues, but honestly, Joseph couldnt make heads or tails of it.Noyes, on the other hand, apparently could. He began smiling in surprise and recognition and began laughing at the revelation. \"You mean... you know about the Migo?\" Now Joseph was confused beyond all reckoning, and apparently so were Marie and Tracy.\"Know aboutthem, know some of them, occasionally work alongside them. And if I may say, for half-fungus, half-arthropod, telepathic pains in the rear, they are remarkably easy to work with.\" What followed was Albert explaining the situation: the weirdest kinds of aliens you could imagine had contacted some humans in the 1800s and hired them to assist in mining certain valuable minerals in the hills of Vermont and Maine. Over the years, the men and women in their employ had received advice from these aliens as to potential marriage partners, first in terms genetic compatibility and superior traits for their offspring, then based on attractiveness as their understanding of human reproductive psychology increased. Finally, as they realized the subtle psychological and social rules of courtship, the began acting as human elites once did, organizing parties for unattached men and women and subtly directing candidates certain ways as they piloted artificial human body-shells around the dance floor. It sounded weird... but reassuring, even humorous. Even Tracy seemed to lighten up... as far as a hunted rabbit couldlighten up.\"Mr. Clayton here is what you may call normal. However, he was privy to manifestations not usual of this Earth.\" Joseph then told the assembled of what he had witnessed, with Professor Andover hypothesizing that the phonograph may have projected images and smells by some means of eldritch energies. Marie also retold the story of her people and of the deal that she had agreed to to gain access to the phonograph: one year back in the village and receiving her tattoos of adulthood. Nothing more and nothing less had been asked of her.\"And finally, we have Ms. Williams, whose tale has much to do with the founding of the organization and its present form.\" Here, Andover seemed to realize what kind of anxiety the girl was going through, and thus went slowly. \"In the winter of 1928, the Miskatonic faculty was contacted by the United States Army to help investigate a series of strange attacks and abductions in Paige County, Virginia. As the base was in a primarily Quaker area, Miskatonic sent its lone member of faculty who was a Friend, one Hiriam Willows of Boston. While he remained among the Quaker farmfolk who knew the habits of the attacks, the army waged war against what was first believed to be a \"degenerate\" tribe of Iroquois but were later found to be white members of a strange fertility cult which engaged in human sacrifice.\"The academic glanced towards Tracy, who had lowered her head, closed her eyes and grimaced at what was surely to come. He turned back to his eager listeners. \"Before Willows left, he discovered strange objects in a secret room at the Longhouse Meeting Hall... objects which resembled those found on the slain cultists. He also, inadvertently, stumbled upon his hosts engaged in a ritual of apparent mourning, dressed as the Southern Iroquois would have been three hundred years ago, sacrificing pigs upon an altar at an isolated circle of standing stones, wailing and keening in grief.\" He looked back at Tracy. \"This was the experience which convinced him that not all who worship the base forces of the universe are driven to evil nor insanity. It was also the experience that not all things should be released to the world, both for the worlds safety and that of the subjects.\"After a moments silence, Tracy spoke. \"Excuse me.\" She got up walked out the door, somewhat to the surprise of her classmates, Marie and Maries family. Marie then got up and went to follow, an act which inevitably drew Joseph after her.They found Tracy sitting at the bottom of the steps, her chin on one balled fist, her other arm across her lap, her eyes staring into some unfathomable distance. Marie went forward first, sitting beside the girl as Joseph hung back. \"I dont think weve been introduced. My names Marie.\" When Tracy didnt answer. \"You know, you dont have to feel bad about what other people did. Those guys the Army killed werent your people, no matter how similar your rituals may have been.\"\"But they weremy people.\" The answer came suddenly and surprised both listeners.\"Pardon?\" Asked Joseph from the middle of the stairway.\"Those dangerous cultists that the professor told you about; they were English, Quakers even... or had been at one time.\" She sighed, not quite sure of herself on how to explain to outsiders the issue which had plagued her fears since the age of 10. \"They were my peoples kin, descendants of those of us who answered the Union armies call for guerrillas during the Civil War. Before that, wed adopted some sacrificial ritual from the Iroquois during the 1720s after some very hard winters. Where before theyd killed dogs, black deer and captured warriors... as well as captured women and children if it got reallybad... to get good crops and health, we imposed strict limits and rules. There was to be no more human sacrifice, we killed our own livestock and above all, we accept the rituals as a gift from on high... even if the whole Christ thing was supposed to render sacrifice obsolete.\"\"Id consider it a divine door prize. But about the Civil War?\" Marie was trying to make the talk as nonthreatening as possible, considering the darkness which had settled over the village.Getting back on topic, Tracy continued. \"Well, wed already been hiding escaped slaves for years on their way up to the major escape routes in Pennsylvania, but we felt that we couldnt do any more, especially with so much Confederate presence in the Shenandoah and the internecine aggression over secession. These people though... they wanted to do something. So, when a few Union officers wanted a meeting, they snuck off north. And when they came back, they brought otherthings with them. Old medieval codices which described Druidic rituals shockingly similar to our own but twisted and brutal, rituals which needed terror to be inflicted in the victims so that the full power of their life force could be drained. Their attitudes had changed as well; they became disdainful of the rest of the community: calling them weak, cowards, savages who refused to possess the full power of the Star Daughter and the Black Stag, fools who held onto their petty delusions of morality. Well, after they went and made a mess of everything by capturing and sacrificing a Confederate squadron... the rest of the Longhouse Quakers shunned them, bidding them to go into the high mountains until they were ready to return. And so, a collection of about 50 men, women and children left the Valley and went into the high woods.\"Joseph put something together in his head. \"And I take it that the next time they returned was 60 years later, crazier than ever.\"Tracy harrumphed. \"Youve got that right. And think about this while youre at it: by the 1920s, wed been isolated for so long that it was starting to show in our features; the more inbred we became, the leaner our faces and the bonier our joints. By the time Willows got there, we just looked skinny and somewhat malnourished and with the right connections a few decades later, that began to get fixed.\" Her face got hard. \"But what if Willows had finked on us, or Miskatonic sent one of their Congregationalist mamas boys instead? Do you realize what may have happened to us, especially in the 20s or 30s? Arresting us for a start, probably followed by forced sterilization and throwing us in crazy houses, sanitariums and prisons to rot. And thats just the adults!\"She was getting visibly angry. \"Their kids, my great-grandparents, would have been shuffled off to orphanages or perhaps boarding schools if they thought we were just really pale Indians.\" She shuddered. \"Ive read about the shit that happened in Canadas residential school system and it gave me just as many nightmares as the thought of my ancestors being hunted like wolves and tortured for things they never did or for who they were.\" She turned to look at Marie and for the first time since he knew her, Joseph could put a name (that name being \"very mildly inbred\") on the features which he had labeled as rural-attractive or cute in a farmers daughter kind of way. \"I know that your people have been hiding, but at least you guys made the mistake of acting like total jerks to get your reputation! We never did anything wrong.\"With that, Tracy got up, passed her companions and just as she was about to reenter the house, she paused and rethought something. \"Well, never did anything wrong besides burning down that chicken barn, but that was an emergency! Neither my aunt nor my little cousin would be here if not for that and besides...\" She turned her head to look at Joseph and Marie. \"They wrote it off as an electrical fire.\" As Tracy went back into the house, Joseph thought that, while going against all conventional reason, his life made perfect sense for the first time in a very long while."]}
{"id": "EN056", "pair": ["Professors Schultz and his entire team had reunited the night their space probe The Nautilus, was floating towards a landmark, it has gone farther than any other space probe. Oh what wonderful things they would discover from that point onward. Each had their own ideals of what they would find and prove that there might be more than what others in their field so strongly believed.For the deeply religious young man, Geralds, who entered the program through luck and his computer skills at twenty-four, he thought that they would find God.Schultz mocked such an idea. He and the majority of the team believed that such more galaxies would be found, hopefully they would include inhabited planets that they could attempt to contact.But one amongst them was nervous. George Sunderland, an old resident of Portland Rhode Island, he was an astro-nut like the rest of them, but on the side, it was revealed some time after their project jettisoned into space, that during down times in one field, he worked in another. And his other, strange field was the occult.\"Fhtagn,\" He breathed under his breath. \"Fhtagn, fhtagn, fhtagn.\"He chanted, hoping that it would protect him. Granted, he reminded himself prior to this that The Nautilus did not go between Hydra and Argo Navis, but the thought still scared him.On the machines before them, it showed exactly where it was. When it reached the landmark, were there cheers, the sounds of champagne popping, and congratulations were shared once more.On the large monitors before them, stars were few and far in between that it was as if they were traveling away from them and not moving towards anymore after them.Geralds was the first to point this out. He was also the first to see the mult-colored aurora that one would never expect to see in space.\"Its like the surface of a bubble,\" Andrea, second oldest member to Schultz stated.Schultz scoffed and was beginning his rant against her, when The Nautilus floated past the aurora and found darkness. A void darker than space itself, yet just light enough due to iridescent orbs that floated in a semi-orderly orbital around an unknown object.\"What is this place?\" Andrea asked.\"Not what, Andrea,\" A voice grated through nowhere. \"But who?\"A giant glowing bubble appeared before the camera. Geralds stood up, overjoyed; he exclaimed his love for God and happiness at finding him. But the grating voice merely chuckled.\"No, Geralds,\" It said, sounding like a six year old and twenty year old and sixty year old man speaking together. \"Not God; at least, not your Christian god. I am, and Sunderland will confirm this,\" The man shivered at his name. \"Yog-Sothoth; past, present, future…Time itself, is all within me.\"\"But what is this?\" Andrea asked.\"This is me.\" The multi-layered voice said. \"What you see is a form of mine. The Gate; right Sunderland.\"All eyes turned to their cowering companion. With a few inhales of the nose, he nodded, a whimper escaping him.\"And within each bubble is a plain; a piece of the bigger picture.\"\"And whats that?\" Schultz asked.\"That your universe; your world; your reality is expanding and shrinking in what-for your mental stability-well say random order.\"\"Preposterous!\" Schultz snapped.Yog-Sothoth chuckled, the intertwined voices sounding exotic over the speakers. It was not malignant-it sounded good natured compared to what Sunderland had expected.\"You see those two bubbles sticking together?\"No one spoke, but there was a sense that there did not have to be. That he could see them as well as hear them. Unsettling though it was, the information presented to them was to the same effect. Poor Sunderland seemed to have already cracked under the circumstances; cowering under a desk.\"They are other universes. Other galaxies; some inhabited, some not. But when they intertwine like that, the barrier of the bubble fades, allowing them to seemingly overlap. Like a continuation of itself. Your own has done so with many of them and has been one of a few to be graced with the central hub, so to speak.\"Schultz was finding this hard to swallow. Being a man of science; something like this was a freak accident not hard fact…Until now, since it was staring them in the face. Leaving skepticism behind; he found infinite possibilities. Keeping his mind wide open seemed to help a little, though. After all, science was still discovering new things almost everyday.\"Whats in the central hub?\" Geralds asked.\"Rlyeh,\" Came the instant reply.At that, Sunderland let out a scream. No one paid him any mind, though, for they were, for a brief second that in the scheme of things that could be said that it did not happen, overcome with primal urges and long lost images transmitted thousands upon thousands of generations before themselves.\"Sunderland,\" Yog-Sothoth said. \"Do not be frightened. Nothing can hurt you right now.\"Sunderland laughed long and hard. Everyone became uneasy except their translucent, shining friend.\"Right now he says.\" Sunderland cracked up, stuttering phrases together in a jumble of unheard sentences.\"If you wish to know more, Schultz, may I ask that you turn The Nautilus in that direction.\" The bubble seemed to turn to the right. \"Theres someone who will do a better job at explaining things in a-and dont be offended by this-lemans terms.\"Goaded on by what the bubble said, the satellite took off to the right. Everyone but Sunderland waited in bated breath at the edge of their seat. Then an insane, cacophonous symphony of flutes was heard.Sunderland snapped out of his babbling mess and stood abruptly, dashing towards Schultz.\"We have to stop this!\"\"We cant,\" Geralds began.\"The Nautilus moves according to projection, we didnt have the financial ability to control it back when we made it.\" Andrea finished.Sunderland made a warrior cry as he ran towards the screen. He beat at it, breaking it in places, but the image still shown through.\"No! No! No!\" He said between beatings. But the image never disappeared, but was, thankfully, distorted.There came a sound of bumping into something beneath the louder cacophony flutes. Sunderland saw an eye open. An eye that was never supposed to open. The Nautilus turned away due to impact, but the damage was done. Sunderland was in a fit of hysterics, writhing on the floor, laughing as his mouth foamed.He looked into the eye of chaos and it stared back with a mind blowing intensity. The distorted image shown next was of bubbles stacking upon themselves and became a vertical line orbiting around the central hub. But they popped.The media was in a frenzy. Children were amazed at seeing real life Pokémon in their back yard. Three teens who broke down in the middle of nowhere found a camp that was not there before and were killed by a man in a hockey mask. Teens who lived on Elm Street started to die in their dreams. A couple were eaten by a giant white worm in Perfection, Nevada. Reports of Batman fighting the Joker were rampant in New York. In Louisiana, there was a report of a man covered in moss and roots walking in the swamp.In London, there were sightings of a man in a Guy Fawkes mask walking around in shadows and on roofs.In the Middle East there were reports of Orcs raiding caves.(1) But Japan had gotten it worst. Godzilla attacks, a strange yet beautiful rider on a mechanical horse, an orange clad ninja, and giant robot fights became an everyday event.\"The world as we knew it is gone!\" Sunderland screamed in his padded cell in Arkham Asylum. \"It popped! Just like a bubble!\"", "The ShoggothI had met Professor Kindle during my explorations in my youth in Berlin at a convention. His theories in such subjects as physics and anatomy were peculiar to me-and to his chagrin-his colleges as well.\"Well, my boy,\" He said upon my asking why everyone seemed to mock him. \"These fools do not wish to see whats so plain that if it were a snake, it would most assuredly bite them.\"Upon that introduction, he had began to tell me how certain miniscule particles held the universe together. What he said went beyond dark matter and such unexplained universal secrets that it was almost hard to believe. But I can tell you, he was convincing. A fact that will later cause me to rethink my pursuits.\"You see, my boy, Yog-Sothoth particles and Azathoth particles exist in sub matter, in a way that can go undetected even more so than the elusive dark matter for it obviously does not refract or twist light in any such matter like anything else in space.\"\"Then how does one know of their existence?\" I asked, and for the fourth time: \"And why those names?\"It was odd to me to think that such a thing would exist that does not interact upon its surroundings. And what was queer was that the names did not follow the standard scientific tradition of Latin roots; instead appearing to be from some alien language.He smiled. \"Come, my boy, I shall show you.\" He draped an arm over my shoulders. \"And as for the names; they are from the Necromicon. A book I doubt you have read, but the names fit, believe me. For you see, Azathoth represents chaos, and Yog-Sothoth order; its like the Chinese philosophy of Yin and Yang, a philosophy I find as very true.\"Kindle took me to his hotel room where he produced from a brown briefcase, a telescope. It looked like any telescope that one could easily obtain from any store for cheap. Yet, something was off. A minor defect, yet hardly noticeable except in the right light. There was an angle of odd proportions etched out of glass and sealed within between the two lenses.\"Look, look.\" He said excitedly.I did look. And what I saw amazed me more than frightened me; as many introductory things do. What appeared to be bubbles and globular orbs of wiggling ganglia-like tentacles were stuck together. I took my eye away.\"And how do you know it keeps the universe together?\"\"It goes in a straight line across the sky.\" He said. \"Granted, its mere speculation, but I believe it to be correct, for, how many things are a perfect line in a vacuum?\"I was unable to disagree.After that, our interactions consisted of an odd letter or two. I became a physician and he became a recluse due to his latest published work that was about his Azathoth and Yog-Sothoth particles. He would only ever briefly say what he was working on. I guess he thought me a fellow conspirator, a rebel to the newly founded scientific idea; anything out of the norm is false, to the point he sent me a battered copy of the Necromicon.I read the book, horrified at what I was reading, that I am still surprised that I did not throw it to the floor and burn it. But the next letter just asked a question:Did you read it?I replied in the positive and the next response was an invitation to his little house in the sparsely populated hills of New England. I will not tell of my travels to his one story house that surprised me that such a man would live there.It was a dilapidated house that looked like time and hillbilly inhabitants before him had a wild party, trashing it beyond any sense of repairing it. When I knocked on the door and my friend opened it, I was greeted with the sight of the inside, which appeared only slightly better than the outside. The wallpaper was peeling, everything was dusty, and the lights were working, yet did not seem to help alleviate the gloom that seemed to settle upon the house in a death grip.\"Ah, its so good to see you, my boy.\" He greeted me, allowing me into the house. \"Come, please sit. I have some tea prepared for your arrival.\"I take the offered liquid and he sits on the armchair across from me. He takes a sip of his tea before setting it down upon the arm of his chair, his finger never leaving the handle.\"I invited you here to see my newest discovery.\" He said, an intense look aimed at me. Like an excited madman holding a gun.\"What is it?\"\"Shoggoths,\"He said that one word, never explaining anything, letting the dreadful word sink into my mind.\"Granted,\" He took another sip. \"I didnt discover them. But there was something that eluded me. A phrase; anyone could over look it, but I didnt. Tekeli-li.\" He almost mimicked a robot.My face turned pale at that word. Instinctual fear ingrown and nearly forgotten, left burrowed into a level of subconscious was unearthed and made me want to run faster than I have ever ran in my entire life. I knew I should have listened to it, but curiosity had gotten the better of me.\"The purpose behind it,\" Kindle continued as if there were no tension in the air. \"Eluded me. Until I started thinking in terms of wolves. Theyre very much alike, you know. Sleek killing machines with a high intelligence(though to-say-Cthulhu or Azathoth, they are stupid).\"With an interesting way to communicate.\" He smirked. \"I was proven correct by mere chance. I spied a shoggoth all alone. It cried out Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li! Another cried out in response, but this one angrier. The first spoke out and went about doing chores.\"\"Thats interesting, Kindle.\" I said. \"But how does this have to do with wolves? They howl to alert members of their pack of their location.\"\"Yes,\" Kindle said matter-of-factly. \"But wolves also have growls and other vocal ways of communicating. Shoggoths only have the one word. And to prove it, I took two Shoggoths and placed them in something similar to a rat maze.\"\"But how did you catch them?\"\"Doesnt matter.\" He snapped. \"Now let me finish, my friend.\"\"One called out and the other started to move and call out as well. This continued until they found each other. It wasnt until I caught more that I made the most startling information about them.\"My body trembles. I can only imagine what else he could have discovered about those loathsome creatures.\"I had caught six or seven of them. I crammed them into this one room below this house. It was getting cramped in there for them, so these two decided to fuse together. And it hit me! Theyre fragments! Their hive mind-like behavior, their similarities. Everything!\"\"Come, Ill show you.\"\"No,\" I snap, standing. \"Id rather not.\"Kindle becomes angered by my outburst. He grabs my arm tightly and tries to drag me towards the cellar, but I resist.\"Come, come, there is nothing to be afraid of.\"\"There is.\" I said. \"Shoggoths…\"I was cut off by a loud thunder from under our feet. Kindle pales as it happens again. He breaks from my arm and tries to run into the kitchen but he never makes it. A long, large, slimy black tentacle rises from the hole it made in the floor. I notice in sick fascination that a black, tar-like substance drips off of it. It darts towards the sound of Kindles running feet and wraps around his leg, forcing him to land, face first, onto the floor.I watch, dumb, as it drags my friend towards the hole. Kindle screams and begs me to help him, but I dont move. Fear plagues me, cementing my feet to the wood floor. It is not until his struggling form sinks into the hole that my feet can work again and I dart out of the house.Tekeli-li!(1)AAAhhhhhhhh!(1)1) These were larger(font 22), but the site messes with me!Mantineus-The ending is ambiguous by default.

{"id": "EN079", "pair": ["Spoonbill Village,Northernmost Quang Binh Province, Socialist Republic of VietnamJuly 2, 2011Two young adults walked up the path beside the bronze-casters shop to the barren hillside and the forest edge beyond. \"So, how do you like things so far?\" Marie asked as she and Joseph made their way up the rough-hewn stone steps. Their destination was the house of the village woodcutter and charcoal-burner, a place that also doubled as a furniture workshop and, importantly for this journey, the villages firearms armory.\"Not that bad. Ive been doing domestic work for the past few days but neither Noc nor his wife seems to really be a slave driver. Actually, they feel more like people who understand that theyre training a new servant.\" Joseph thought on something. \"Im actually surprised that he and the other hunters allowing me to accompany them. They neither seem to respect me or anyone who would stoop to use a gun, so I wonder why they changed their attitude.\"It was here that Marie began ruminating on something, an old thought that had given her more than her share of bad dreams. \"There are some things worth surrendering pride for, Joseph. Tell me, have you seen those weird scars on the ankles and arms of Nocs wife?\"\"You mean those marks that look like Giant Squid wounds? Yes, but what about them?\" Joseph suddenly stopped. \"What are they, anyway?\"Having stopped also, Marie sighed, a sense of foreboding covering her features. \"When I asked that myself, they didnt tell me much more than the stories Id already heard when I was a kid: legends about ghosts, devils from the mist, shadows that drink blood is what they called them sometimes. But what I got here is that those Shugoran priests that saved my people werent just going to somewhere. They were running ifrom/i somewhere, someone or something, something that no one is willing to talk any further about.\" Marie started forward again at such a pace that her boyfriend had to hurry to catch up.Getting the feeling that nothing more was going to be answered on that subject for a good while, Joseph changed track. \"How are the others getting on? Ive been stuck in the house most of the day and I havent really had a chance to talk to either the Prof or my classmates.\"Happy to shift from thoughts of chilling horror, Marie chuckled with increasing mirth as she began going back up the trail. \"From what Ive heard, Alberts been filming every step in the bronze making process that he can, not to mention all the casting processes and various uses of equipment. The only reason that he hasnt been thrown out yet is because the familys elder patriarch has taken a liking to… well, not just him, but all of you guys, just from the descriptions alone. Your Professor and his assistant have basically locked themselves in the temple: no word out yet, but I assume that theyre observing normal operations. As for Tracy…\" Here, Marie began acting a little odd. \"She talks in her sleep, if you didnt know.\"\"Really?\" Joseph responded interestedly. Not reacting the way that she had feared, Marie relaxed a little from the paranoia she had been wrangling with.\"Yeah, and the strange thing is that its in… well, tree-ish. And then theres the tattooing on her back as well.\" Marie went on talking, relieved that her fear seemed to have been senseless.Before he could answer his girlfriends increasingly chatty descriptions, a thought crossed Josephs mind on exactly why such a thing might be mentioned. \"Why would you ask me if I knew…\" Then the realization hit him and he stopped cold. \"Were you thinking that… Tracy and I?\"Marie stopped as well. \"Its not unknown to happen, you know.\" Marie answered the implied question almost defensively, as if trying to justify her momentary paranoia. \"Sweethearts get separated and sometimes… one finds companionship elsewhere. Especially with, you know.\" Marie tapped the side of her head, indicating the \"visitors\" that had first cursed Joseph Claytons existence during High School.Joseph snorted in an amused, disparaging way. \"Please dont give them that much credit. Ive ignored, rebuked and insulted those jerks so many times that Ive made a virtual bloodsport out of it. Besides, if Id made any moves towards Tracy, Albert would have killed me.\"\"Wait, those two… theyre together?\" Marie asked, wondering how shed missed that.\"Intimately so, yes.\" This was all Joseph was willing to say, himself not wishing to examine too closely the memory of walking in on his dorm-mate and his girl when they had neglected to put a sock on the doorknob. \"Anyway, as to these voices, I went to the psychology department to see if I could discover just what was causing it.\"Marie waited a heartbeat before plunging into the vital question. \"And what did they say?\" If her boyfriend did indeed have Schizophrenia, then he needed help: drugs to control the symptoms and perhaps therapy to help him conquer whatever dark corners of his psyche were feeding these voices.If it was something else… then perhaps the local sorcerers might need to be consulted before long.Joseph sighed. Whatever is going on inside my head, the geeks with the scanning equipment are pretty sure that this isnt a case of medical Schizophrenia. They say that the symptoms are all wrong, the voices arent persuasive enough… and that I dont have any of the telltale injuries on the brain that would suggest medical reasons. And then there was the time they hooked me up to the EEG during one of my episodes.\" He paused, wondering just how to proceed but, since he was already experiencing strange things, he decided just to press on. \"The guys swore that, before the equipment shorted out, at least two additional wavelengths were being read beside mine.\" With a shrug, Joseph summed up his thoughts. \"Ever since I came here and heard all of the seemingly crazy stories from you and the others… I dont know, but what Ive gone through just makes sense now, at least in knowing that it actually can happen.\"Marie smiled. Yes, we definitely need to consult the priests. \"Come on, weve talked enough and you need to get that rifle before you head out.\"And rifles there were, all secured inside a triple locked room in the back corner of the woodcutters house. They looked like Berthier carbines, French bolt-action repeaters from the First World War… but they were not the only guns present. \"Is that a Hotchkiss?\" Joseph asked in a voice combining bemusement and astonishment. Among the rifles and a few, scattered revolvers sat a machine-gun still on its tripod and looking impossibly well-maintained for being kept in the back room of a house located in a tropical moist forest.\"An M1914 by the looks of it, if the pictures Ive seen are at all accurate. Theres a story behind it, but I only know that only the oldest elders know it.\" Marie replied, having picked up of the Berthier Carbines and handing it to Joseph. The ammunition was kept in a chest under a trapdoor in the main part of the house as a safety measure so theyd have to go back to pick it up. But then she asked the question that she probably should have asked before they left the village proper. \"Speaking of guns, since when did you shoot?\"\"Theres a gun range in Arkham; Tracy and Albert invited me along for a few lessons before Thanksgiving. Shes the one with actual hunting experience and I think he only came along to check out the engineering on the pieces. It wasnt that much fun, but I think what I learned in getting my license will help on this.\" Joseph began inspecting the carbine he had been given, finding it oiled and well-maintained as any other firearm in the room. There was a question that had to be asked, however?Where did they get all these guns?15 minutes LaterMarie walked up the stairs to her grandparents house. She was supposed to act as a translator and informant for the expedition, having prior contacts inside the community and being a member first by blood and more recently by initiation. Truth be told, she had a feeling that old Tsan was really acting as gatekeeper in his interactions with Professor Andover while she was playing the part of a more convenient and mobile ambassador, Tsan having never left the temple save by palanquin in almost forty years.Walking in the door, Marie was unprepared for another surprise. She saw Tracy sitting before the camera as her Grandmother and Aunt watched, waiting to begin filming the days questions and activities, even making a short introductory statement... but not in English.\"And as soon as the translator gets here, well begin the second day of... Hey Marie, you almost scared me there.\" Here was an audible note of guilt as Tracy hastily switched from the strange language that she had been using to the carefully modulated, Patsy Cline-accented English she had used since Marie had met her. Marie had heard it, and Tracy knew that she had heard... and Marie knew that Tracy knew.\"Yeah, Ive gotten that reaction a few times since I got here.\" Marie joked, knowing that humor had the power to break tension. \"So... what language were you speaking in anyway? Im afraid I didnt recognize anything about it.\" Her female elders watched closely, knowing that something had happened but being ignorant of other languages, were unsure of exactly what.Tracy grinned bitterly. \"Id be more surprised if you did recognize it. Its... well, its not really a language per se, but a patois of a couple languages, with Early Modern English, Ohio Valley Shawnee, Coastal Algonquian, some Iroquoian loanwords having to do with ritual and bits of Eastern Siouan.\" Tracy let out the deep breath she had been using to list all those languages. She was getting more comfortable now. \"I guess it wont do any harm if I told you, seeing as were almost in the same boat.\"Tracy beckoned Marie to sit, turning off the camera as she did. \"The kids in my town learn it... well, sort of as a first language; English is really more of a first-and-a-half language for us. We got exposed to it through TV and then when we went to school, but most of our formative years were spent listening to and absorbing the patois around the house. Most of us never really let go of it as a language for our own private conversations.\"Marie reflected on this... but was also noting some of the features on Tracys face: the high, rounded cheeks, her high-bridged nose, the way that her eyes were less the bright crystal blue of stereotype and more of a dark, cloudy blue resembling ultramarine. \"I hope you dont mind me saying this, Tracy but does your family have any Native American ancestry? I dont mean to pry, but you do kind of have the look.\"Tracy considered this for a moment before giving an affirmative nod. \"My fathers paternal grandmother was from the Oklahoma Kiowa. My mother, as far as can be traced, is also about an eighth, this time one-eighth Shawnee, which seems to be the median for Longhouse.\" She got an odd, contemplative look on my face. \"Thats another one of those things that we try not to mention to outsiders, even though they tend to notice it anyway. Back in the old days, admitting it would have been a quick ticket to using a segregated washroom or worse. And now?\" Tracy shrugged. \"Now its considered cool, while the inbreeding still makes us look like freaks.\"Marie decided to test something, just for her own sake. \"Albert doesnt seem to think youre a freak.\" The more she thought about it, she had more in common with Tracy than first realized. Both of them had lived life right on the edge of themselves and their kin being recognized as something other, something foreign to the perceived natural order of the world. Both of them could sense the threat of possible revelation... and knew what it was to try to trust someone with these secrets.\"Hey, youre talking about a guy whose family has worked for alien mushroom bugs for the last hundred years. A bit of mild inbreeding is probably the most normal thing Als ever experienced.\" Here there was definitely affection to her voice, a cue that no matter what other strangeness they were involved in, there was a loving relationship between the two.At this thought Marie smiled, thanking the ancestors for a little bit of normalcy in this year-long cavalcade of oddities that she had flung herself into. Then another question sprang forth. \"Did you know about the whole alien thing when you guys were at Miskatonic?\"Tracy shook her head. \"No, but then again, he was always kinda spacey.\" Marie couldnt help but giggle at this bad pun. Tracy went on, the affection still in her voice. \"Seriously, the thing about Miskatonic is that, after awhile, you begin getting the feeling that almost everyone else is holding something close to their chest, thinking each word over before saying it. Its then that you realize that... youre not alone, that almost everyone else is as paranoid as you are, having something to hide.\" She looked towards Marie. \"Everyone except for your Joseph, that is. The only thing strange about him that I noticed was that romance was nowhere on his radar at all.\"\"Youd be surprised, actually.\" Marie answered cryptically. Before Tracy could ask, she turned back the camera back on, signaling the beginning of the interview session.That eveningSweaty, hot, dirty and exhausted, Joseph Clayton exited the forest with Noc and the other hunters. Between all of them, the hunters had brought down a Sambar stag and three small muntjacs. Joseph, for his part, had escaped being gored by a wild boar only by dodging its charge, rolling into a hollow under a log and then shooting it in the head at point-blank range when it tried to go after him. For this feat, the hunters designated him \"master of the pit\" when they roasted it at tonights feast. It had sounded like an honorable title, but Joseph could guess that they were making him little more than a cook, a traditionally female position.Still, it was an in and it would probably be research gold.He was entirely less enthusiastic about what else was coming back with them.When he and the group of hunters came into the village proper, he saw Marie and the taller, paler form of Tracy coming towards him, having been up on the family terrace transplanting rice seedlings. Due to her fair skin, Tracy was wearing the largest hat she could while her arms and shins had been slathered with sunblock. Marie had already taken hers off.As they neared him, Marie slowed to a stop, seeing the grim look on Josephs face. Tracy looked at her in confusion, then at Joseph and from his stony face understood that something was wrong. \"What is it?\" Marie asked her boyfriend.Joseph sighed. \"When the hunters brought us in, were we supposed to be for any kind of important sacrifice?\"\"Well, the Rhinoceros Festival is supposed to happen any day now. Its when we recharge the mist that surrounds the village to keep us hidden.\" Marie looked around Joseph to where one of the hunters was leading a group of people into the village. They looked like quite a bedraggled bunch, many of them thin and in questionable health. There were also two women who may have been considered beautiful if not for the look in their eyes that they had been through several levels of hell before coming here.But for all these conditions, they did not look frightened of their tattooed guides.Noticing where Marie was looking, Joseph offered explanation. \"We met up with them about a mile down the trail. Apparently the government sent up street people as some fresh blood for you guys. And thats not all. Apparently...\" Here, he lowered his voice \"One of the families that were living incognito in Vinh got killed a few nights ago: Father, mother, twelve year old boy... from what I heard it sounded like some sort of animal tore them up inside their apartment... and no blood was spilled.\"Tracy looked like she was going to vomit at the news, while a look of dread overcame Marie, as old legends came forth out of the terrifying mist of childhood nightmare to become shadows in the waking world. \"Is there anything else?\" Marie asked quietly.Now it was Josephs turn to look back at the party coming out of the forest, which were now carrying a man by his hands and feet on a pole, his mouth gagged and his eyes blindfolded. \"Only that they also sent you a sacrifice. From what they said, hes a drug-runner, sexual slaver and a general bad example of low-level underworld scum.\"Marie, still in shock over the news of the murders, was perhaps not picking and choosing the words coming out of her mouth. \"Which mean hes gonna taste worse than the fish sauce.\"At these words, both gruesome and almost ridiculous, both her lover and her friend goggled at her.", "VII.Yet all this was only the prologue of the actual Dunwich horror. Formalities were gone through by bewildered officials, abnormal details were duly kept from press and public, and men were sent to Dunwich and Aylesbury to look up property and notify any who might be heirs of the late Wilbur Whateley. They found the countryside in great agitation, both because of the growing rumblings beneath the domed hills, and because of the unwonted stench and the surging, lapping sounds which came increasingly from the great empty shell formed by Whateley’s boarded-up farmhouse. Earl Sawyer, who tended the horse and cattle during Wilbur’s absence, had developed a woefully acute case of nerves. The officials devised excuses not to enter the noisome boarded place; and were glad to confine their survey of the deceased’s living quarters, the newly mended sheds, to a single visit. They filed a ponderous report at the court-house in Aylesbury, and litigations concerning heirship are said to be still in progress amongst the innumerable Whateleys, decayed and undecayed, of the upper Miskatonic valley.      An almost interminable manuscript in strange characters, written in a huge ledger and adjudged a sort of diary because of the spacing and the variations in ink and penmanship, presented a baffling puzzle to those who found it on the old bureau which served as its owner’s desk. After a week of debate it was sent to Miskatonic University, together with the deceased’s collection of strange books, for study and possible translation; but even the best linguists soon saw that it was not likely to be unriddled with ease. No trace of the ancient gold with which Wilbur and Old Whateley always paid their debts has yet been discovered.      It was in the dark of September 9th that the horror broke loose. The hill noises had been very pronounced during the evening, and dogs barked frantically all night. Early risers on the 10th noticed a peculiar stench in the air. About seven o’clock Luther Brown, the hired boy at George Corey’s, between Cold Spring Glen and the village, rushed frenziedly back from his morning trip to Ten-Acre Meadow with the cows. He was almost convulsed with fright as he stumbled into the kitchen; and in the yard outside the no less frightened herd were pawing and lowing pitifully, having followed the boy back in the panic they shared with him. Between gasps Luther tried to stammer out his tale to Mrs. Corey.      “Up thar in the rud beyont the glen, Mis’ Corey—they’s suthin’ ben thar! It smells like thunder, an’ all the bushes an’ little trees is pushed back from the rud like they’d a haouse ben moved along of it. An’ that ain’t the wust, nuther. They’s prints in the rud, Mis’ Corey—great raound prints as big as barrel-heads, all sunk daown deep like a elephant had ben along, only they’s a sight more nor four feet could make! I looked at one or two afore I run, an’ I see every one was covered with lines spreadin’ aout from one place, like as if big palm-leaf fans—twict or three times as big as any they is—hed of ben paounded daown into the rud. An’ the smell was awful, like what it is araound Wizard Whateley’s ol’ haouse. . . .”      Here he faltered, and seemed to shiver afresh with the fright that had sent him flying home. Mrs. Corey, unable to extract more information, began telephoning the neighbours; thus starting on its rounds the overture of panic that heralded the major terrors. When she got Sally Sawyer, housekeeper at Seth Bishop’s, the nearest place to Whateley’s, it became her turn to listen instead of transmit; for Sally’s boy Chauncey, who slept poorly, had been up on the hill toward Whateley’s, and had dashed back in terror after one look at the place, and at the pasturage where Mr. Bishop’s cows had been left out all night.      “Yes, Mis’ Corey,” came Sally’s tremulous voice over the party wire, “Cha’ncey he just come back a-postin’, and couldn’t haff talk fer bein’ scairt! He says Ol’ Whateley’s haouse is all blowed up, with the timbers scattered raound like they’d ben dynamite inside; only the bottom floor ain’t through, but is all covered with a kind o’ tar-like stuff that smells awful an’ drips daown offen the aidges onto the graoun’ whar the side timbers is blown away. An’ they’s awful kinder marks in the yard, tew—great raound marks bigger raound than a hogshead, an’ all sticky with stuff like is on the blowed-up haouse. Cha’ncey he says they leads off into the medders, whar a great swath wider’n a barn is matted daown, an’ all the stun walls tumbled every whichway wherever it goes.      “An’ he says, says he, Mis’ Corey, as haow he sot to look fer Seth’s caows, frighted ez he was; an’ faound ’em in the upper pasture nigh the Devil’s Hop Yard in an awful shape. Haff on ’em’s clean gone, an’ nigh haff o’ them that’s left is sucked most dry o’ blood, with sores on ’em like they’s ben on Whateley’s cattle ever senct Lavinny’s black brat was born. Seth he’s gone aout naow to look at ’em, though I’ll vaow he wun’t keer ter git very nigh Wizard Whateley’s! Cha’ncey didn’t look keerful ter see whar the big matted-daown swath led arter it leff the pasturage, but he says he thinks it p’inted towards the glen rud to the village.      “I tell ye, Mis’ Corey, they’s suthin’ abroad as hadn’t orter be abroad, an’ I for one think that black Wilbur Whateley, as come to the bad eend he desarved, is at the bottom of the breedin’ of it. He wa’n’t all human hisself, I allus says to everybody; an’ I think he an’ Ol’ Whateley must a raised suthin’ in that there nailed-up haouse as ain’t even so human as he was. They’s allus ben unseen things araound Dunwich—livin’ things—as ain’t human an’ ain’t good fer human folks.      “The graoun’ was a-talkin’ lass night, an’ towards mornin’ Cha’ncey he heerd the whippoorwills so laoud in Col’ Spring Glen he couldn’t sleep nun. Then he thought he heerd another faint-like saound over towards Wizard Whateley’s—a kinder rippin’ or tearin’ o’ wood, like some big box er crate was bein’ opened fur off. What with this an’ that, he didn’t git to sleep at all till sunup, an’ no sooner was he up this mornin’, but he’s got to go over to Whateley’s an’ see what’s the matter. He see enough, I tell ye, Mis’ Corey! This dun’t mean no good, an’ I think as all the men-folks ought to git up a party an’ do suthin’. I know suthin’ awful’s abaout, an’ feel my time is nigh, though only Gawd knows jest what it is.      “Did your Luther take accaount o’ whar them big tracks led tew? No? Wal, Mis’ Corey, ef they was on the glen rud this side o’ the glen, an’ ain’t got to your haouse yet, I calc’late they must go into the glen itself. They would do that. I allus says Col’ Spring Glen ain’t no healthy nor decent place. The whippoorwills an’ fireflies there never did act like they was creaters o’ Gawd, an’ they’s them as says ye kin hear strange things a-rushin’ an’ a-talkin’ in the air daown thar ef ye stand in the right place, atween the rock falls an’ Bear’s Den.”      By that noon fully three-quarters of the men and boys of Dunwich were trooping over the roads and meadows between the new-made Whateley ruins and Cold Spring Glen, examining in horror the vast, monstrous prints, the maimed Bishop cattle, the strange, noisome wreck of the farmhouse, and the bruised, matted vegetation of the fields and roadsides. Whatever had burst loose upon the world had assuredly gone down into the great sinister ravine; for all the trees on the banks were bent and broken, and a great avenue had been gouged in the precipice-hanging underbrush. It was as though a house, launched by an avalanche, had slid down through the tangled growths of the almost vertical slope. From below no sound came, but only a distant, undefinable foetor; and it is not to be wondered at that the men preferred to stay on the edge and argue, rather than descend and beard the unknown Cyclopean horror in its lair. Three dogs that were with the party had barked furiously at first, but seemed cowed and reluctant when near the glen. Someone telephoned the news to the Aylesbury Transcript; but the editor, accustomed to wild tales from Dunwich, did no more than concoct a humorous paragraph about it; an item soon afterward reproduced by the Associated Press.      That night everyone went home, and every house and barn was barricaded as stoutly as possible. Needless to say, no cattle were allowed to remain in open pasturage. About two in the morning a frightful stench and the savage barking of the dogs awakened the household at Elmer Frye’s, on the eastern edge of Cold Spring Glen, and all agreed that they could hear a sort of muffled swishing or lapping sound from somewhere outside. Mrs. Frye proposed telephoning the neighbours, and Elmer was about to agree when the noise of splintering wood burst in upon their deliberations. It came, apparently, from the barn; and was quickly followed by a hideous screaming and stamping amongst the cattle. The dogs slavered and crouched close to the feet of the fear-numbed family. Frye lit a lantern through force of habit, but knew it would be death to go out into that black farmyard. The children and the womenfolk whimpered, kept from screaming by some obscure, vestigial instinct of defence which told them their lives depended on silence. At last the noise of the cattle subsided to a pitiful moaning, and a great snapping, crashing, and crackling ensued. The Fryes, huddled together in the sitting-room, did not dare to move until the last echoes died away far down in Cold Spring Glen. Then, amidst the dismal moans from the stable and the daemoniac piping of late whippoorwills in the glen, Selina Frye tottered to the telephone and spread what news she could of the second phase of the horror.      The next day all the countryside was in a panic; and cowed, uncommunicative groups came and went where the fiendish thing had occurred. Two titan swaths of destruction stretched from the glen to the Frye farmyard, monstrous prints covered the bare patches of ground, and one side of the old red barn had completely caved in. Of the cattle, only a quarter could be found and identified. Some of these were in curious fragments, and all that survived had to be shot. Earl Sawyer suggested that help be asked from Aylesbury or Arkham, but others maintained it would be of no use. Old Zebulon Whateley, of a branch that hovered about half way between soundness and decadence, made darkly wild suggestions about rites that ought to be practiced on the hill-tops. He came of a line where tradition ran strong, and his memories of chantings in the great stone circles were not altogether connected with Wilbur and his grandfather.      Darkness fell upon a stricken countryside too passive to organise for real defence. In a few cases closely related families would band together and watch in the gloom under one roof; but in general there was only a repetition of the barricading of the night before, and a futile, ineffective gesture of loading muskets and setting pitchforks handily about. Nothing, however, occurred except some hill noises; and when the day came there were many who hoped that the new horror had gone as swiftly as it had come. There were even bold souls who proposed an offensive expedition down in the glen, though they did not venture to set an actual example to the still reluctant majority.      When night came again the barricading was repeated, though there was less huddling together of families. In the morning both the Frye and the Seth Bishop households reported excitement among the dogs and vague sounds and stenches from afar, while early explorers noted with horror a fresh set of the monstrous tracks in the road skirting Sentinel Hill. As before, the sides of the road shewed a bruising indicative of the blasphemously stupendous bulk of the horror; whilst the conformation of the tracks seemed to argue a passage in two directions, as if the moving mountain had come from Cold Spring Glen and returned to it along the same path. At the base of the hill a thirty-foot swath of crushed shrubbery saplings led steeply upward, and the seekers gasped when they saw that even the most perpendicular places did not deflect the inexorable trail. Whatever the horror was, it could scale a sheer stony cliff of almost complete verticality; and as the investigators climbed around to the hill’s summit by safer routes they saw that the trail ended—or rather, reversed—there.      It was here that the Whateleys used to build their hellish fires and chant their hellish rituals by the table-like stone on May-Eve and Hallowmass. Now that very stone formed the centre of a vast space thrashed around by the mountainous horror, whilst upon its slightly concave surface was a thick and foetid deposit of the same tarry stickiness observed on the floor of the ruined Whateley farmhouse when the horror escaped. Men looked at one another and muttered. Then they looked down the hill. Apparently the horror had descended by a route much the same as that of its ascent. To speculate was futile. Reason, logic, and normal ideas of motivation stood confounded. Only old Zebulon, who was not with the group, could have done justice to the situation or suggested a plausible explanation.      Thursday night began much like the others, but it ended less happily. The whippoorwills in the glen had screamed with such unusual persistence that many could not sleep, and about 3 A.M. all the party telephones rang tremulously. Those who took down their receivers heard a fright-mad voice shriek out, “Help, oh, my Gawd! . . .” and some thought a crashing sound followed the breaking off of the exclamation. There was nothing more. No one dared do anything, and no one knew till morning whence the call came. Then those who had heard it called everyone on the line, and found that only the Fryes did not reply. The truth appeared an hour later, when a hastily assembled group of armed men trudged out to the Frye place at the head of the glen. It was horrible, yet hardly a surprise. There were more swaths and monstrous prints, but there was no longer any house. It had caved in like an egg-shell, and amongst the ruins nothing living or dead could be discovered. Only a stench and a tarry stickiness. The Elmer Fryes had been erased from Dunwich."]}

A Result and a Prologue1.From a private hospital for the insane near Providence, Rhode Island, there recently disappeared an exceedingly singular person. He bore the name of Charles Dexter Ward, and was placed under restraint most reluctantly by the grieving father who had watched his aberration grow from a mere eccentricity to a dark mania involving both a possibility of murderous tendencies and a profound and peculiar change in the apparent contents of his mind. Doctors confess themselves quite baffled by his case, since it presented oddities of a general physiological as well as psychological character.      In the first place, the patient seemed oddly older than his twenty-six years would warrant. Mental disturbance, it is true, will age one rapidly; but the face of this young man had taken on a subtle cast which only the very aged normally acquire. In the second place, his organic processes shewed a certain queerness of proportion which nothing in medical experience can parallel. Respiration and heart action had a baffling lack of symmetry; the voice was lost, so that no sounds above a whisper were possible; digestion was incredibly prolonged and minimised, and neural reactions to standard stimuli bore no relation at all to anything heretofore recorded, either normal or pathological. The skin had a morbid chill and dryness, and the cellular structure of the tissue seemed exaggeratedly coarse and loosely knit. Even a large olive birthmark on the right hip had disappeared, whilst there had formed on the chest a very peculiar mole or blackish spot of which no trace existed before. In general, all physicians agree that in Ward the processes of metabolism had become retarded to a degree beyond precedent.      Psychologically, too, Charles Ward was unique. His madness held no affinity to any sort recorded in even the latest and most exhaustive of treatises, and was conjoined to a mental force which would have made him a genius or a leader had it not been twisted into strange and grotesque forms. Dr. Willett, who was Wards family physician, affirms that the patients gross mental capacity, as gauged by his response to matters outside the sphere of his insanity, had actually increased since the seizure. Ward, it is true, was always a scholar and an antiquarian; but even his most brilliant early work did not shew the prodigious grasp and insight displayed during his last examinations by the alienists. It was, indeed, a difficult matter to obtain a legal commitment to the hospital, so powerful and lucid did the youths mind seem; and only on the evidence of others, and on the strength of many abnormal gaps in his stock of information as distinguished from his intelligence, was he finally placed in confinement. To the very moment of his vanishment he was an omnivorous reader and as great a conversationalist as his poor voice permitted; and shrewd observers, failing to foresee his escape, freely predicted that he would not be long in gaining his discharge from custody.      Only Dr. Willett, who brought Charles Ward into the world and had watched his growth of body and mind ever since, seemed frightened at the thought of his future freedom. He had had a terrible experience and had made a terrible discovery which he dared not reveal to his sceptical colleagues. Willett, indeed, presents a minor mystery all his own in his connexion with the case. He was the last to see the patient before his flight, and emerged from that final conversation in a state of mixed horror and relief which several recalled when Wards escape became known three hours later. That escape itself is one of the unsolved wonders of Dr. Waites hospital. A window open above a sheer drop of sixty feet could hardly explain it, yet after that talk with Willett the youth was undeniably gone. Willett himself has no public explanations to offer, though he seems strangely easier in mind than before the escape. Many, indeed, feel that he would like to say more if he thought any considerable number would believe him. He had found Ward in his room, but shortly after his departure the attendants knocked in vain. When they opened the door the patient was not there, and all they found was the open window with a chill April breeze blowing in a cloud of fine bluish-grey dust that almost choked them. True, the dogs howled some time before; but that was while Willett was still present, and they had caught nothing and shewn no disturbance later on. Wards father was told at once over the telephone, but he seemed more saddened than surprised. By the time Dr. Waite called in person, Dr. Willett had been talking with him, and both disavowed any knowledge or complicity in the escape. Only from certain closely confidential friends of Willett and the senior Ward have any clues been gained, and even these are too wildly fantastic for general credence. The one fact which remains is that up to the present time no trace of the missing madman has been unearthed.      Charles Ward was an antiquarian from infancy, no doubt gaining his taste from the venerable town around him, and from the relics of the past which filled every corner of his parents old mansion in Prospect Street on the crest of the hill. With the years his devotion to ancient things increased; so that history, genealogy, and the study of colonial architecture, furniture, and craftsmanship at length crowded everything else from his sphere of interests. These tastes are important to remember in considering his madness; for although they do not form its absolute nucleus, they play a prominent part in its superficial form. The gaps of information which the alienists noticed were all related to modern matters, and were invariably offset by a correspondingly excessive though outwardly concealed knowledge of bygone matters as brought out by adroit questioning; so that one would have fancied the patient literally transferred to a former age through some obscure sort of auto-hypnosis. The odd thing was that Ward seemed no longer interested in the antiquities he knew so well. He had, it appears, lost his regard for them through sheer familiarity; and all his final efforts were obviously bent toward mastering those common facts of the modern world which had been so totally and unmistakably expunged from his brain. That this wholesale deletion had occurred, he did his best to hide; but it was clear to all who watched him that his whole programme of reading and conversation was determined by a frantic wish to imbibe such knowledge of his own life and of the ordinary practical and cultural background of the twentieth century as ought to have been his by virtue of his birth in 1902 and his education in the schools of our own time. Alienists are now wondering how, in view of his vitally impaired range of data, the escaped patient manages to cope with the complicated world of today; the dominant opinion being that he is lying low in some humble and unexacting position till his stock of modern information can be brought up to the normal.      The beginning of Wards madness is a matter of dispute among alienists. Dr. Lyman, the eminent Boston authority, places it in 1919 or 1920, during the boys last year at the Moses Brown School, when he suddenly turned from the study of the past to the study of the occult, and refused to qualify for college on the ground that he had individual researches of much greater importance to make. This is certainly borne out by Wards altered habits at the time, especially by his continual search through town records and among old burying-grounds for a certain grave dug in 1771; the grave of an ancestor named Joseph Curwen, some of whose papers he professed to have found behind the panelling of a very old house in Olney Court, on Stampers Hill, which Curwen was known to have built and occupied. It is, broadly speaking, undeniable that the winter of 1919-20 saw a great change in Ward; whereby he abruptly stopped his general antiquarian pursuits and embarked on a desperate delving into occult subjects both at home and abroad, varied only by this strangely persistent search for his forefathers grave.      From this opinion, however, Dr. Willett substantially dissents; basing his verdict on his close and continuous knowledge of the patient, and on certain frightful investigations and discoveries which he made toward the last. Those investigations and discoveries have left their mark upon him; so that his voice trembles when he tells them, and his hand trembles when he tries to write of them. Willett admits that the change of 1919-20 would ordinarily appear to mark the beginning of a progressive decadence which culminated in the horrible and uncanny alienation of 1928; but believes from personal observation that a finer distinction must be made. Granting freely that the boy was always ill-balanced temperamentally, and prone to be unduly susceptible and enthusiastic in his responses to phenomena around him, he refuses to concede that the early alteration marked the actual passage from sanity to madness; crediting instead Wards own statement that he had discovered or rediscovered something whose effect on human thought was likely to be marvellous and profound. The true madness, he is certain, came with a later change; after the Curwen portrait and the ancient papers had been unearthed; after a trip to strange foreign places had been made, and some terrible invocations chanted under strange and secret circumstances; after certain answers to these invocations had been plainly indicated, and a frantic letter penned under agonising and inexplicable conditions; after the wave of vampirism and the ominous Pawtuxet gossip; and after the patients memory commenced to exclude contemporary images whilst his voice failed and his physical aspect underwent the subtle modification so many subsequently noticed.      It was only about this time, Willett points out with much acuteness, that the nightmare qualities became indubitably linked with Ward; and the doctor feels shudderingly sure that enough solid evidence exists to sustain the youths claim regarding his crucial discovery. In the first place, two workmen of high intelligence saw Joseph Curwens ancient papers found. Secondly, the boy once shewed Dr. Willett those papers and a page of the Curwen diary, and each of the documents had every appearance of genuineness. The hole where Ward claimed to have found them was long a visible reality, and Willett had a very convincing final glimpse of them in surroundings which can scarcely be believed and can never perhaps be proved. Then there were the mysteries and coincidences of the Orne and Hutchinson letters, and the problem of the Curwen penmanship and of what the detectives brought to light about Dr. Allen; these things, and the terrible message in mediaeval minuscules found in Willetts pocket when he gained consciousness after his shocking experience.      And most conclusive of all, there are the two hideous results which the doctor obtained from a certain pair of formulae during his final investigations; results which virtually proved the authenticity of the papers and of their monstrous implications at the same time that those papers were borne forever from human knowledge.2.      One must look back at Charles Wards earlier life as at something belonging as much to the past as the antiquities he loved so keenly. In the autumn of 1918, and with a considerable show of zest in the military training of the period, he had begun his junior year at the Moses Brown School, which lies very near his home. The old main building, erected in 1819, had always charmed his youthful antiquarian sense; and the spacious park in which the academy is set appealed to his sharp eye for landscape. His social activities were few; and his hours were spent mainly at home, in rambling walks, in his classes and drills, and in pursuit of antiquarian and genealogical data at the City Hall, the State House, the Public Library, the Athenaeum, the Historical Society, the John Carter Brown and John Hay Libraries of Brown University, and the newly opened Shepley Library in Benefit Street. One may picture him yet as he was in those days; tall, slim, and blond, with studious eyes and a slight stoop, dressed somewhat carelessly, and giving a dominant impression of harmless awkwardness rather than attractiveness.      His walks were always adventures in antiquity, during which he managed to recapture from the myriad relics of a glamorous old city a vivid and connected picture of the centuries before. His home was a great Georgian mansion atop the well-nigh precipitous hill that rises just east of the river; and from the rear windows of its rambling wings he could look dizzily out over all the clustered spires, domes, roofs, and skyscraper summits of the lower town to the purple hills of the countryside beyond. Here he was born, and from the lovely classic porch of the double-bayed brick facade his nurse had first wheeled him in his carriage; past the little white farmhouse of two hundred years before that the town had long ago overtaken, and on toward the stately colleges along the shady, sumptuous street, whose old square brick mansions and smaller wooden houses with narrow, heavy-columned Doric porches dreamed solid and exclusive amidst their generous yards and gardens.      He had been wheeled, too, along sleepy Congdon Street, one tier lower down on the steep hill, and with all its eastern homes on high terraces. The small wooden houses averaged a greater age here, for it was up this hill that the growing town had climbed; and in these rides he had imbibed something of the colour of a quaint colonial village. The nurse used to stop and sit on the benches of Prospect Terrace to chat with policemen; and one of the childs first memories was of the great westward sea of hazy roofs and domes and steeples and far hills which he saw one winter afternoon from that great railed embankment, all violet and mystic against a fevered, apocalyptic sunset of reds and golds and purples and curious greens. The vast marble dome of the State House stood out in massive silhouette, its crowning statue haloed fantastically by a break in one of the tinted stratus clouds that barred the flaming sky.      When he was larger his famous walks began; first with his impatiently dragged nurse, and then alone in dreamy meditation. Farther and farther down that almost perpendicular hill he would venture, each time reaching older and quainter levels of the ancient city. He would hesitate gingerly down vertical Jenckes Street with its bank walls and colonial gables to the shady Benefit Street corner, where before him was a wooden antique with an Ionic-pilastered pair of doorways, and beside him a prehistoric gambrel-roofer with a bit of primal farmyard remaining, and the great Judge Durfee house with its fallen vestiges of Georgian grandeur. It was getting to be a slum here; but the titan elms cast a restoring shadow over the place, and the boy used to stroll south past the long lines of the pre-Revolutionary homes with their great central chimneys and classic portals. On the eastern side they were set high over basements with railed double flights of stone steps, and the young Charles could picture them as they were when the street was new, and red heels and periwigs set off the painted pediments whose signs of wear were now becoming so visible.      Westward the hill dropped almost as steeply as above, down to the old \"Town Street\" that the founders had laid out at the rivers edge in 1636. Here ran innumerable little lanes with leaning, huddled houses of immense antiquity; and fascinated though he was, it was long before he dared to thread their archaic verticality for fear they would turn out a dream or a gateway to unknown terrors. He found it much less formidable to continue along Benefit Street past the iron fence of St. Johns hidden churchyard and the rear of the 1761 Colony House and the mouldering bulk of the Golden Ball Inn where Washington stopped. At Meeting Street - the successive Gaol Lane and King Street of other periods - he would look upward to the east and see the arched flight of steps to which the highway had to resort in climbing the slope, and downward to the west, glimpsing the old brick colonial schoolhouse that smiles across the road at the ancient Sign of Shakespears Head where the Providence Gazette and Country-Journal was printed before the Revolution. Then came the exquisite First Baptist Church of 1775, luxurious with its matchless Gibbs steeple, and the Georgian roofs and cupolas hovering by. Here and to the southward the neighbourhood became better, flowering at last into a marvellous group of early mansions; but still the little ancient lanes led off down the precipice to the west, spectral in their many-gabled archaism and dipping to a riot of iridescent decay where the wicked old waterfront recalls its proud East India days amidst polyglot vice and squalor, rotting wharves, and blear-eyed ship-chandleries, with such surviving alley names as Packet, Bullion, Gold, Silver, Coin, Doubloon, Sovereign, Guilder, Dollar, Dime, and Cent.      Sometimes, as he grew taller and more adventurous, young Ward would venture down into this maelstrom of tottering houses, broken transoms, tumbling steps, twisted balustrades, swarthy faces, and nameless odours; winding from South Main to South Water, searching out the docks where the bay and sound steamers still touched, and returning northward at this lower level past the steep-roofed 1816 warehouses and the broad square at the Great Bridge, where the 1773 Market House still stands firm on its ancient arches. In that square he would pause to drink in the bewildering beauty of the old town as it rises on its eastward bluff, decked with its two Georgian spires and crowned by the vast new Christian Science dome as London is crowned by St. Pauls. He liked mostly to reach this point in the late afternoon, when the slanting sunlight touches the Market House and the ancient hill roofs and belfries with gold, and throws magic around the dreaming wharves where Providence Indiamen used to ride at anchor. After a long look he would grow almost dizzy with a poets love for the sight, and then he would scale the slope homeward in the dusk past the old white church and up the narrow precipitous ways where yellow gleams would begin to peep out in small-paned windows and through fanlights set high over double flights of steps with curious wrought-iron railings.      At other times, and in later years, he would seek for vivid contrasts; spending half a walk in the crumbling colonial regions northwest of his home, where the hill drops to the lower eminence of Stampers Hill with its ghetto and negro quarter clustering round the place where the Boston stage coach used to start before the Revolution, and the other half in the gracious southerly realm about George, Benevolent, Power, and Williams Streets, where the old slope holds unchanged the fine estates and bits of walled garden and steep green lane in which so many fragrant memories linger. These rambles, together with the diligent studies which accompanied them, certainly account for a large amount of the antiquarian lore which at last crowded the modern world from Charles Wards mind; and illustrate the mental soil upon which fell, in that fateful winter of 1919-20, the seeds that came to such strange and terrible fruition.      Dr. Willett is certain that, up to this ill-omened winter of first change, Charles Wards antiquarianism was free from every trace of the morbid. Graveyards held for him no particular attraction beyond their quaintness and historic value, and of anything like violence or savage instinct he was utterly devoid. Then, by insidious degrees, there appeared to develop a curious sequel to one of his genealogical triumphs of the year before; when he had discovered among his maternal ancestors a certain very long-lived man named Joseph Curwen, who had come from Salem in March of 1692, and about whom a whispered series of highly peculiar and disquieting stories clustered.      Wards great-great-grandfather Welcome Potter had in 1785 married a certain \"Ann Tillinghast, daughter of Mrs. Eliza, daughter to Capt. James Tillinghast\", of whose paternity the family had preserved no trace. Late in 1918, whilst examining a volume of original town records in manuscript, the young genealogist encountered an entry describing a legal change of name, by which in 1772 a Mrs. Eliza Curwen, widow of Joseph Curwen, resumed, along with her seven-year-old daughter Ann, her maiden name of Tillinghast; on the ground that her Husbands name was become a publick Reproach by Reason of what was knowne after his Decease; the which confirming an antient common Rumour, tho not to be credited by a loyall Wife till so proven as to be wholely past Doubting. This entry came to light upon the accidental separation of two leaves which had been carefully pasted together and treated as one by a laboured revision of the page numbers.      It was at once clear to Charles Ward that he had indeed discovered a hitherto unknown great-great-great-grandfather. The discovery doubly excited him because he had already heard vague reports and seen scattered allusions relating to this person; about whom there remained so few publicly available records, aside from those becoming public only in modern times, that it almost seemed as if a conspiracy had existed to blot him from memory. What did appear, moreover, was of such a singular and provocative nature that one could not fail to imagine curiously what it was that the colonial recorders were so anxious to conceal and forget; or to suspect that the deletion had reasons all too valid.      Before this, Ward had been content to let his romancing about old Joseph Curwen remain in the idle stage; but having discovered his own relationship to this apparently \"hushed-up\" character, he proceeded to hunt out as systematically as possible whatever he might find concerning him. In this excited quest he eventually succeeded beyond his highest expectations; for old letters, diaries, and sheaves of unpublished memoirs in cobwebbed Providence garrets and elsewhere yielded many illuminating passages which their writers had not thought it worth their while to destroy. One important sidelight came from a point as remote as New York, where some Rhode Island colonial correspondence was stored in the Museum at Fraunces Tavern. The really crucial thing, though, and what in Dr. Willetts opinion formed the definite source of Wards undoing, was the matter found in August 1919 behind the panelling of the crumbling house in Olney Court. It was that, beyond a doubt, which opened up those black vistas whose end was deeper than the pit.", "April 20th, 1909They have given me one hour to record my thoughts. Whether this be mercy or mockery, I know not. It seems at this point to be a matter of perspective and to their vision I cannot speak. They are among us and yet beyond us.My name, my true name, the name given to me by my mother on the day of my birth is Henry Davis Johnstone. Though by the time this is read there will be no memory of my being. And despite this note being written behind the ancient granite walls of Arkham Sanitarium believe that its author is not mad!I was mad. Even from birth I was stricken with a distinct melancholia, which puzzled doctors and strained the frail spirits of my parents. As I grew, the condition only worsened and my days as a schoolboy were marked with despondency and torpor. A fog of weariness touched all who came near and people hastily learned to avoid my influence.When it came time for me to move to higher education my father insisted I attend the local school, Miskatonic University, I suspect more out of frugality than to keep me near by need of fondness. My days as a college man were fraught with abject isolation. No field of study could hold my attention and no sport nor society could capture my interest. I had no friends and certainly no prospects for marriage.It came to pass that while arriving late to lecture on English literature of the sixteenth century I took the notice of a pompous and sarcastic professor. Seeing my black dress and sullen expression, he raised his arms like a dramatist and pronounced, Why look, class! Look at this young agelast. It be Hamlet the Dane, here in the flesh. Tell me, Prince, hast thou yet taken thy revenge gainst thy lecherous uncle Claudius?\"The students erupted in vexatious laughter. I was overcome, and I speedily exited the hall in search of some well-shadowed place. From then on, my peers knew me as Hamlet and murmured to each other in jest whenever I passed.I cannot recall the moment when my affliction grew from a simple eccentricity into a state of illness. The shift was slow and subtle. At the end of my second year at Miskatonic, the student liaison sat with me and I was informed that due to my abysmal student record and obvious aprosexia I was not welcome to attend the institute next semester. The only response I could muster was an impotent shrug. The news was not shocking, though I had desperately wished my case and I might escape the notice of the office staff. With a feeble groan, I lifted myself from my seat and began the way back to my fathers house. The journey was hardly laborious for we lived on Parsonage Street, within two miles of the school. But on that day I was drowned with fatigue. My legs were young and strong but I hadnt the volition to operate them.A schoolfellow found me the following afternoon lying in the shade of an apple tree. My memory of this event is vague and distant, suffering from the fugue in which I was held. The student who came to my aid (his name eludes me) was a graduate student in the competitive and arduous field of theoretical physics and had been witness to more than one mental lapse in his peers. He recognized my condition immediately and brought me directly to the colleges school of psychology.It took no more than a moment for those learned men to spot the illness in my mind. A simple exchange determined the path of my life for the next six years. I was bound for extended occupancy at Arkham Sanitarium.There are some who fear the sanatorium. One can hardly forget tales of Bedlam or Goyas images of poor idiots in torment. No doubt, such madhouses exist where callous professionals employ bizarre and deleterious procedures on the hapless lunatics in their care. But I found my hospital to be a different experience entirely. Here was a sanctum in the old tradition where mercy to the sick was put above the aggressive meddling of the analysts. This was my habernacle. My even disposition and independence swiftly earned me friends among the staff. And in the company of disruptive neurotics, my draining influence was taken as a blessing.Not to say I was left deserted - far from it. The doctors prescribed various laetificants, exposure to direct sunlight, massage, mineral baths, invigorating emollients and agents to thicken the blood. And as each therapy failed, as they all failed, they did not lose heart. They patiently and methodically exhausted every curative known to science.I was neither bitter at medicines inability to improve my condition nor at fortune for my having been born so feeble of will. Does a slug look to the gleeful hummingbird with envy? I was born a slug and I say it does not.As you might imagine, time passed uneventfully. Now and then, a doctor might remark that some advancement had been made in the medical community that might make the difference in my case. We would attempt the regimen and it would eventually prove ineffective. This continued for five long years until the arrival of the two men who led me to this fate. Two men who, due to my impending executioners, never existed.The first was Professor Adam Wayland Erikson, a graduate of Bute Medical School and honoured fellow of the Royal College of Physicians who served a lengthy internship under renowned patient advocate Sir John Charles Bucknill. I presume Dr. Bucknill still exists in memory. But how can I know? Maybe my life has descended into phantasm and this account is worthless. Or perhaps they will sweep this note into oblivion with the rest of my existence.That is enough of that. I have much to record and time is short. Suffice it to say that on a tour of American asylums Dr. Erikson was charmed and delighted by Arkhams facilities and benevolent ideology. He immediately appealed for a position at the institute and was accepted heartily.The good doctor brought with him the second man I know to be lost. Introduced to me as Mr. Sean Jones, a Welshman who was afflicted with mental disturbances reportedly so peculiar that Dr. Erikson devoted his life to the case. Seans family had spent the better part of the Georgian Era in the vilest but most lucrative acts of piracy. He had been born into substantial wealth but with such a nefarious family reputation that it was difficult to enjoy.As we were housed in rooms across the hall, were of similar age, and because we both understood what it was to be an outsider, Mr. Jones and I became quick friends. And that connection proved to be mutually beneficial. Whereas I was bound by lethargy, half-dead as some described me, my comrade was bursting with energy, a tireless maelstrom of activity. I found his company energizing and to him I was a source of calmness and rest.He confided in me, overflowing with stories of his ancestors terrible deeds and of their pact with dark powers hidden to mankind by the oceans depths. All sailors know to respect the guiding stars but only a few are privy to their secrets. Sean relayed to me in great detail the lessons in sabaism taught to him by his father. He spoke of worlds beyond where abnormous creatures harnessed dark energies so powerful that their influence could be felt here on earth. This was why, he claimed, he had caught the interest of Dr. Erikson. Not for his psychopathology but for the eldritch wisdom he had acquired in his life as a degenerate mystic.Though Seans charisma tempted me to believe him, his story was too fantastic to trust even the smallest detail. He was, after all, a madman. I continued to listen with interest but I was convinced I was audience to an elaborate fiction.Then it came that I was sitting with Dr. Erikson for a monthly interview and assessment. The doctor noted that I had been spending much of my time speaking with Sean and he inquired into the nature of our conversations. At first, I hesitated. My instinct was to misreport the wild stories out of loyalty to my friend. But reason led me to deduce that candour would best serve his treatment. I explained all I understood of what I had been told as precisely as I could.Erikson simply nodded and when I had finished he prepared for himself a cigarette.\"Hes a genius, you know,\" he said.I was astounded. It felt as if the floor was shifting beneath me.He continued: \"Sometime ago, I came across an article in the Journal of Mental Science entitled Oneiromancy as an Effect of Ferromagnetic Consequence. It was the most brilliant work I had ever seen. And it was submitted anonymously. I wanted desperately to contact the master behind the work but there were almost no leads.\"The doctor stared at the burning tip of his cigarette. I glanced about the room nervously.\"Sean was the author?\" I asked.\"It took me four years to find him. I followed a collection of academic treasures: medical research, historical treatises, mathematical proofs - even an English translation of the infamous Liber Damnatus. At the last, I bribed a courier to give up his secret employer. When he directed me to Denbigh Asylum, I assumed Id find my scholar amidst the staff. But there he was, locked away and heavily sedated. He had directed all of that magnificent research through intermediaries from a tiny cell. I swore at that moment both to heal him and learn from him.\"I couldnt have been more shocked. This tale seemed even less plausible than Seans wild accounts. A fear took me. I suspected that I had finally crossed into a realm of complete madness and unreality. But the doctor was not finished with me.\"Henry, I believe Sean and I have made a breakthrough. Its a radical procedure involving the surgical insertion of several rare earth magnets directly into the tissue of the brain. I have practised the operation on various animals and I am confident the procedure is sound. It follows logically that I begin human trials. The professionally responsible course of action would be to bring my findings to a university, but the theory behind our technique is so advanced it may take decades before our science is peer-approved. And the mystical nature of some of our discoveries will be easy sport for sceptics.Sean demands I perform the surgery on him. But you see, his mind, his metaphysical insight, is too precious to be lost to an experimental procedure. I am asking you, and it is a great deal to ask, to undergo the operation as a safety trial.\"My heart sank. I loved knowledge and cared for my friend. But surely this was insanity of the most outlandish variety.I inquired, \"What effect would a procedure designed for Seans brain have on my own?\"\"The operation would be adapted to suit your needs. Whereas Sean requires limiting and pacification, you need to be energized or awakened. Its a simple question of placing the magnets within different structures of the brain. Sean will determine the specifics.\"\"So this might possibly cure me?\" I asked.\"If our theories hold true you will see a miraculous increase in function. There is also a high risk that you will not survive.\"I could sense the doctors disappointment even before I spoke.\"I may be mad, but I have no wish to die. And this notion of health you offer is utterly alien to me. Who would be this happy man wearing my skin?\"Erikson replied, \"I am not ass enough to believe you enjoy your present condition.\"\"I accept my state of being and, more to the point, I identify with this way of life. This may be pitiful but it is my way. I refuse and that is my final word.\"He dismissed me with an understanding nod and I retired to the mineral baths. Their placid relaxation quickly blent away thoughts of experimental surgery. Before long, I could barely recall our conversation and considered the matter dealt with.Over the following week, I heard nothing of the subject. Sean kept away from me, I supposed to keep his dissatisfaction from affecting our friendship. I gave him a wide berth, confident he would surmount these feelings and soon all would be as it was. With time, Dr. Eriksons procedure would be approved by the medical community and he would have his cranial magnets.It was a cold and stirless night when he came to me. I was in my bed lost in dream when I was jerked awake. A drop of icy fluid trickled with precision into the canal of my ear. I flung myself from the bed in a chaotic motion. There, sitting peacefully, was Sean, his hands buried in the pockets of a heavy coat. I stood in puzzlement for on his face I saw neither malevolence nor jest. Indeed, the man before me was a portrait of repose.\"You will undergo the surgery,\" he said, looking blankly at the wall.It took me a moment to gather an answer. His disposition was so alien, his aspect so void.\"I will not. You are a dear friend, but dearer to me is my life.\"I had played tennis with Sean and I had run with him. To that point, I thought I possessed an understanding of his physical abilities. He was a slight man, no doubt the product of his overactive metabolism. But the speed with which he captured me and the strength with which he held his ether rag over my nose and mouth were simply astounding. I held my breath as best I could, but there was no escape. He had me locked like a master wrestler with an intensity reserved for the mad.As I faded, he spoke to me: \"The Powers mock me for having been born a mortal of an insignificant species. They bar me from the Dreamlands and laugh at my ambitions. But I know my power and I know my worth. I promise you, my friend, you shall be cured and soon after, I shall be delivered my mind in full. The knowledge of Pnakotus will I take and it shall lead me to Kadath in the Cold Waste. When I have conquered there the Gods will be compelled to honour me with a place in the Court of Azathoth at the centre of all things.\"I awoke in the sanatoriums infirmary, my head aching and bandaged like a mummy. All things seemed distant and unreal, no doubt from the powerful opiates they administered to me. Dr. Erikson came to observe later on that first day of my awakening. In my heart, I wished to cry out that he was a ruthless butcher, but in my state I did not possess the power of speech. And so I lay dazedly while he prodded at me with arcane devices. I even heard him remark that I was progressing well and that he was now confident enough to operate on Jones. The only action I could muster was a low groan.Soon after the doctor left, darkness took me and I slept for two more days. When I awoke on that third day it was to an awakening beyond that which any man before has had. For no one before me could have leapt from the pure anhedonia in which I was lost into the ripe fullness of living wonder I now experience. Still unconscious, I rose from my bed and wandered into the being of this new existence. It wasnt until a nurse found me mumbling in the garden that I finally awoke in full. Her grip on my arm was tight and yet wondrous, the pressure of each of her digits a new universe of interest. I could feel the twist and sway of every hair on my body. And what is more, I could concentrate and remember their feeling. For the first time in all my life, I began to understand what it was to be alive. Still in that transcendent moment, I remembered the awful state of things.\"Where is Sean?\" I asked.\"Wanted to wish your friend luck, did you? Im sorry, Henry, you just missed him. He entered surgery a few minutes ago.\"I rushed away at that second, for the clarity offered me by my newfound mind led me to dark conclusions. Sean Jones was not undergoing this surgery to alleviate madness but to unleash the full psychic potential of his diseased mind! What horrific consequences this might have on mankind I could not say. It seemed entirely possible that he could alter the shape of time and space not only in this universe but also beyond.I dashed through the halls of the sanatorium to the operating theatre and burst in.It appears my time has almost run out. I must be brief. This situation suits me fine as human language fails in describing what occurred next.In the operating room, I found Dr. Erikson, Sean and three humanoid figures caught in conversation. The creatures were uniformly tall, at least six feet, and utterly, completely featureless. They were smooth and indistinct, like matte cloth, and were completely motionless. Though they did not speak, I could feel their intelligence within the recesses of my own mind. They exuded no mood, feeling or character that I could discern but the presence of their psyches was profoundly apparent. No sooner had I entered than Sean and the doctor faded from existence. Right before my eyes, they shifted from being to nothingness in a slow gradient. I turned to run.\"Do not flee,\" said a voice that came from, or perhaps through, one of the alien figures.\"What have you done?\" I asked.\"The one had designs against one of our realities, the other an unwitting accomplice. They were, are, and ever shall be no more. To this end you too shall pass.\"My chest heaved with panic. Unlike any other time in my memory, I did not doubt my senses in this circumstance. These beings are truer than what sane men call reality. They are beyond it.And I said, \"Ive done nothing wrong.\"\"Your mind has been awoken. This will not be tolerated. The mere fact that you are capable of this exchange means you must be undone.\"I argued with those beings, but to no avail. We spent a great deal of time in communication and I have learned things I thought no man would ever discover. And woe befalls me for having this knowledge. I havent even the means to record here the details. There simply are no words.They sent me here to my room with the specific instruction to compose a note detailing the situation. I cannot guess their intent.I see by my bedside clock that my time is short. All that remains, I guess, is to bestow some moral on my tale.Perhaps sometime in the future a reader is thinking, \"Was your restoration worth the fate that befell you?\"To him, I can only reply that exp[note ends]"]}
{"id": "EN061", "pair": ["The world we live in is not as it seems. I, James White, write this document so that others may be made aware of what I have experienced and know of the dangers that lurk beneath our limited perception of \"reality\". Whether you believe me or not, dear reader, is up to you. I only ask that you read what I write with an open mind since I write, not for my own gain, but to warn you of what I can only describe as \"pure evil\".I had never heard of the \"Cult of Cthulhu\" before I began university in the late summer of 2012. I was only eighteen years old, an atheist, and dogmatically pursued scientific understanding and knowledge. At that time, I was not in the least bit interested in weird cults and other religious movements, which I simply dismissed as primitive superstition. Had I but known what I would encounter, I would have burnt the science textbook, prayed to God for the strength not to crumble into insanity and got as far away from that university as I could!The strange happenings started less than two months into my first term. I had been put into student accommodation and shared a corridor with four other boys and two girls. I had got to know my flatmates very well until all of a sudden, one of the boys by the name of Jonathan Mears disappeared. This wasnt looked upon as weird at first since Jonathan was the quiet type anyway and often spent long hours alone in his room. The suspicions arose however, when he hadnt shown his face for three days. His absence was brought up one evening as we sat in a communal area.\"Hes probably just been very busy lately,\" my best friend, Jacob Shields, said. \"You know Jonathan. When he sets his mind on something, he doesnt stop until hes achieved whatever hes trying to do.\"\"Isnt it a bit strange though?\" Annie Roberts, a lovely blonde girl from the room directly across the corridor asked. \"I mean, hes in our corridor and we havent seen him for ages. Not even in the kitchen or lecture halls.\"\"It isnt like him to miss a lecture,\" I agreed. Jacob merely waved these concerns away.\"If we havent seen him by tomorrow evening, well go to the reception and see whats happening,\" he said cheerfully.But Jonathan didnt show up the following day and, as planned, my entire corridor went to the reception desk to ask if anything had happened to him. The receptionist, an elderly lady, checked through the files on a computer before looking up at us.\"Im afraid he has left the university,\" she informed us. \"He dropped out four days ago.\"\"Well there you go!\" Jacob exclaimed. \"Nothing to worry about!\"But there was something to worry about. Even though I now had every reason to think that Jonathan was fine, I couldnt shake that feeling of foreboding. He had seemed happy in university and was consistently getting high marks so I resolved to check things out for myself.I waited until 3:00 the following morning, and in the darkness, I tiptoed along the corridor to Jonathans room. Using a paperclip, I carefully picked the lock on his door and let myself in. I closed the door behind me and switched on the light. The sight that greeted me came as a huge shock. Clothes still lay on the floor, the bed was made, books were still on the shelves and a laptop was still humming gently on the cluttered desk. In short, it looked as though Jonathan was simply out of the room. If he had gone home, why did he leave all his things behind? And if he hadnt, where was he and why did the university records state that he had? Deeply concerned, I left the room and returned to my own. I lay awake in the darkness pondering the thoughts in my head and finally decided that I needed to find out what had happened and that I would do so alone...", "This is based off of real events that have happened to a friend of mine. The impulse Harold has at the beach, the fish, and the dream. Everything else is fictional.IHarold Durby has been my friend since the age of six, having met in kindergarten. A non-native to Florida, unlike myself, he came from Massachusetts-though where has always alluded my mother and father since Harolds single mother always changed the subject.He was a strapping brown haired, blue eyed ball of energy that it was a shock to all that he would befriend me, the class nerd-for at such a young age, I discovered the astounding information that knowledge can give. Yet, we were bound by a shared passion of the ocean. His wide knowledge and love of fish was beyond his years and was always spoken with such passion that it seemed as if he longed to swim beneath the waves forever. And as he grew, it was as if he believed he belonged there more than he did upon land and felt cursed to walk with us humans.And I found myself feeling the same way. Though it was not put to question until his forties, the first sign should have been gleaned on his nineteenth year.Walking along the lonely, early morning beach-our routine since starting high school together(though we graduated at this point)-found us gazing upon a lazy, gray sun rising out of the sea weed infested waves. Minor chit-chat and crashing waves pervaded our silence as gulls stretched their wings and took flight when, out of nowhere, Harold stopped in his tracks, head whipping towards the ocean, eyes cloudy and unfocused.\"Harold,\" I called, trying to gain his attention. \"Harold!\"He took a stiff step towards the ocean, then another, his arms out to his side, palms facing forward like the Virgin Mary as his steps increased. I tugged at his sleeve to break this trance that was placed upon him.We were a good fifteen feet out, the sand beneath us making the cresting waves come up just above his belt, being a couple inches taller than myself, when a whistle blew.\"Get out of the water!\" The lifeguard called from his position on his tower.I looked away from Harold at that moment to see the purple and red flag with a no swimming sign on it. Harold, having been brought back by the whistle, was the first to move back towards land.Panting and chilled by the wind blowing across out wet clothing, I attempted to ask my friend what came upon him. Though he was crouched over, hands on knees, I could see on his face a sort of horror and shock that I have not seen on him before.\"Harold,\" I pushed. \"What came over you?\"\"You didnt hear it?\" He asked, sounding surprised, covering up his fear.\"Hear what?\"\"Then why did you go out with me?\"\"I was trying to snap you out of it.\" I explained.\"Then you didnt hear it?\"\"Hear what?\"He dismissed my question with a shake of his head. \"Forget it, lets just go home.\"I nodded, knowing better than to drop it, but also knowing that Harold would tell me when hes ready.From then on he went to the beach a few more times, but after those times, it was strictly on the sand and never in the water. His claim was that fish kept bumping into him, which is not too unusual, for I have seen their glistening, silver bodies flash beneath the waves-but they never touched any of us, just Harold. Which made him nervous since he wouldnt hurt a fly on purpose, and the murky water doesnt offer much in the way of spying on them.IIMany years pass in a blink of an eye and I find myself in an insurance company(1), while Harold is a marine biologist professor at the local University of Central Florida. In our mid-thirties, we find ourselves successful in our occupations, yet not so in our love life-a fact our mothers love to point out. Though not from a lack of trying, both Harold and myself have tried, but my girlfriends do not last long and, for some odd reason, girls seem to find Harold oddly repulsive. A fact I cannot grasp, for he is a handsome gentleman.But we are content enough with our lives. Though, as was to be expected, since our income was good but not good enough for housing prices, we rented an apartment together.But that veil was quick to be cast away from our eyes. For Harold, from what I could gather, he had night terrors. Screaming out insane verses in tongues befitting gibberish, yet sounded so calculated, so alien, that it hadnt crossed my mind that it couldnt be actual speech. Which frightened me a great deal.And I had asked so frequently that it became routine that when he entered the small dining room that he sardonically stated-more than asked-that he had night terrors, of which I would groggily grunt in the affirmative.Forty reaches us and its like someone turned the volume off. Harold stopped the night terrors when he reached thirty six and a strange acceptance seemed to be permanently stuck on him, a great contrast to the tired and jumpy Harold that I knew during that time. A Harold whos mother would call begging me to pick him up from work because something was off.I didnt think much about it. Night terrors can be overcome, much like any phase of human development, that I was happy when this change occurred. Which then brought up an ancient mystery; the city in which he dwelled before coming to Florida.\"Innsmouth,\" He told me one day. \"Im from Innsmouth, Massachusetts. My mom finally told me.\"\"Thats nice,\" I told him. \"Any reason she told you this now?\"I did not mean for it to sound so rude, but one has to ask why wait so long to tell your son where it was he grew up. By waiting this long why not simply leaving him in the dark? Though not the best option, it seemed more practical then to tell him now. I was curious as any friend would be, though it made those attempts to find out more about the Durbys past seem asinine.His face became unreadable, in deep thought, his features seemed almost fish like in the light.\"She said I need to go back. That I need to go back for a while to understand.\"\"Understand what?\" Came my obvious question when he trailed off into silence.\"She didnt say.\"\"Well, when do you suppose youll go?\"\"This coming week. I know you have vacation time saved up, too. Id like it if you came with me to see the place of my birth and to figure out what my mother meant.\"I was happy that he would ask. Despite the fact that I never cared about that missing piece of Harold, I found myself curious about it now due to his mothers cryptic words.IIIOur first time on a plane and it was nothing like we expected. We boarded on time, but our plane was held fifteen minutes longer. Im glad Harold had the window seat for, from what I saw out of it, I would have went into a panic attack. If man were meant to fly he would have wings.For hours we were stuck up there with minor turbulence, boredom, and anxiety for what we will see once we get off in Boston where we would board a train into Arkham where a cab will need to be hailed for us to proceed into-what the internet called-a dying fishing town. From what we gathered, only a few people still lived there and many of the buildings were run down.No wonder she left. But we were to go there no matter what. For whatever Ms. Durby meant, it was obvious it was eating away at Harold. But I did not push him for details, history has shown me that he will tell me when hes ready.The train ride went off without a scene, but in Arkham, when we hailed a cab, the driver got out to open the back, passenger door when he looked at me then Harold.\"Goin to Innsmouth, eh.\" He stated rather than asked.\"Yes,\" Harold asked. \"How did you know?\"He did not answer, merely motioned for us to get in-which we did-and he got back to the front seat where he drove off without another word.\"You look like yer from there.\" The driver stated, looking at Harold.Strange enough, I had not seen the physical changes from my friend. I suppose spending such a time with someone can allow you to not notice a few things. Like his eyes, they were a dull blue now instead of the vibrant orbs they used to be. His face was becoming rounder on the sides, flatter in the front, and red welts were where neck met shoulders.He never looked that way before, and from what I gather, the people must always look like this. I was confused, but whenever either of us asked him anymore, he would remain silent. Though, when I mentioned that we shall remain there until Friday, he nodded his head and assured us hed be there.We reach Innsmouth by six in the afternoon, the sun already set and the dim glow of a crescent moon fills the night sky along with a plethora of stars you couldnt see in the city. In the dark Innsmouth looked like a deserted, ghost town-the houses and shops, as well as the odd church, looked worse for wear, giving the town an elephant graveyard appeal. The hotel our cab was stationed outside looked nice, yet drearily abandoned.The cab driver then spoke once more to us. \"Please feel free to chose your own rooms. The manager does not reside here anymore. And only two families remain here.\"\"Where is he?\" Harold asked. \"And why so few people?\"\"Out at sea,\" And with that he got back in and drove back to Arkham.With a stretch of paranoia, we climbed the steps in a solemn fashion more befitting a funeral procession than a march to your new-though for only a few days-home. The cab driver was correct, the front desk looked as if the manager had not packed up his things and headed out to sea, the only way to tell how long is to dust through layers of dust and cob-webs.\"Do you really suppose its okay to stay here?\" I asked.\"I dont like it either, but it was unlocked and from what I gather,\" he traced a finger along the banister that was against the far left wall as he ascended the stairs towards the rooms that resided up there. \"He is not coming back. But dont worry, well check the log book if we can and give him the correct amount on Friday should he return.\"I follow him up the steps and to the left theres a hallway with doors carved out of it. Its completely made of wood with generic pictures that adorn almost every hotel across the nation. Harold picks the last one on the left, closest to the end-hallway window which, no doubt, gives the hall its light since the lighting fixtures most likely dont work anymore-where as I picked the last on the right, a few feet away from the window.Our rooms were like a carbon copy from one another; a twin bed, whose head rested against the right wall, across from that the window and a bedside table and another window facing the bed with a door that conjoins rooms to the left of the bed. Throwing my satchel down, I laid on the bed, my conscious still screaming this was wrong, but the very powerful need of sleep overpowered that urge and soon I found myself asleep.The morning came upon us almost too soon, but with both windows letting the celestial orb in with glaring intensity due to dust, we woke up almost blinded.After our short celebration and shouts from room to room that the water actually worked, we showered and headed outside, hopping to meet some of the locals and grab a quick bite to eat-having not eaten since lunch yesterday.The town seemed to be cloistered together, tall brick buildings of which were, for the most part, dusty and abandoned with messy stores, one, a house, even had an upstairs bedroom in the living room. But such is the curse of time. Fortunately, the town is rather small, and as luck would have it one of the families was a baker, for their store was open and pleasant smells wafted from its ovens and like an arrow, hit the mark that was our noses.The inside was styled into a turn of the century bakery with old looking ovens with bread, cakes, and other sweets in a glass case that doubled as a counter. The woman behind it was slightly round around the middle, though the reason came from a cherubic coo in a rocking cradle that she was stooped over. Her sunflower blonde hair was in a librarians bun, her white apron splattered with spots of flour, jellies, and perhaps some genetic material that came from her baby girl.\"Hello, George, come to pick up more bread? Or is it something…\"She looks at us keenly, as if we were joined at the hip-a joke many people have said about us-or something. Then she smiles.\"Well, dont get many visitors around here anymore.\" She said, it was then that I noticed her features that were more pronounced than Harolds and her voice seemed to border on croaking, yet still managed to be cheerful.\"What brings you two boys to Innsmouth?\"\"Im Harold Durby, I was born here.\" Harold stated. I introduced myself before he continued. \"My mom said I had to come back to find my roots.\"\"Youre Alisons brat?\" She said aghast. \"Funniest thing in the world, that one-ran away. Her husband-your father-was so mad, he tore up your house.\" She leaned in closer when the baby sniffled from her mothers loud speaking. Brought their bedroom into the living room.\"I was stunned, that house, the one I thought of as being worse for wear by time, was actually destroyed by Harolds father. What man could possibly do that? And if he can do that, what would he do to Harold? I pale at the thought but the object of my worrisome thoughts break me out of it.\"What happened to my father?\" Harold asked in a manner as if he already knew.\"Went back, boy, went back. Nothing keeping him here and they can…\" She spied me. \"Does he know?\"Harold shook his head. \"Not even I know.\"She was taken aback. \"Your mom ever told you?\"Harold shook his head.\"Figures, nothing right with that one.\" She mumbles off something then smiles again. \"So, how long are you boys in Innsmouth?\"\"Till Friday,\" Harold stated. \"Just to see what I need to see.\"\"Well, come back here after closing, Ill tell you all you need to know. But come alone…We dont take well with outsiders, not like youre not, but youre more one of us than he is. No offense dear, its habit.\"I wasnt offended, merely surprised. Didnt she think Harold would tell me what she tells him? He had no real bond to this place like he did in Florida.\"Anyway, what would you boys like to eat? Dont got much, mostly we go to Ipswich to get supplies, but its a ways, so I tried to lessen our travels by cooking a few things here.\" She then gasps in remembrance. \"I almost forgot. My names Henrietta.\"We ordered our breakfast, ate it, then went on our way. The sights of Innsmouth worth seeing were few; a beach that leads to Devils Cove the docks. But everything was in ill repair, obviously having been neglected by the towns remaining population-however many is uncertain, for we only met Henrietta and her baby.IVThat night I was peacefully sleeping, dreams of sailing in violet skies, my crew and I lax upon the deck, the currents calm enough for daydreaming. But then a pale, blue hand grabbed onto my shoulder and shook me.I woke up to Harolds hand gently shaking my shoulder. A grave expression brought out stress wrinkles, his eyes set in concentration. He sighed, never looking at me as he explained what happened previously.\"I saw the elusive George.\" He explained. \"And their spouses.\"He sighs before he continues:\"You see, Innsmouth was in a bind so they made a pact with these creatures called the Deep Ones. They gave the people fish in exchange for humans to mate with as well as human sacrifices. Henrietta and George are married to them; George even gave up his house and moved to Devils Reef for her.\" He shook his head. \"Still cant get over it; how can anyone love a thing like that?\"But you see, my mother was one of the few non-hybrids left.\"\"Hybrids?\"\"Ill get to that,\" He said dismissively. \"Anyway, my mom didnt like what she was married to. That it touched her. She had me and ran away-I think because she did not want him to hurt me like he does her. She always had him locked in the attic.\"He laughs. \"You see, my friend, those night terrors, I remember ever single one. Cyclopean structures of coral and sand in some of them. In others I see my relatives, alive and kicking as hybrid creatures with blue scales and fish features. I also saw my dad. I saw him run into the night, howling in rage all the while he headed back to Devils Reef; where their city dwells. The first one was this horrible nightmare where you and I were on one of our morning walks when a giant wave crashed down on the both of us, sucking us out to sea. The problem was that you floated to the surface, but I was stuck mere feet away from it.\"\"It was scary, trying to hold in air, fighting to the top, only to discover that I can breathe. But my addled mind begs me to breach the surface, I tug on your pant leg and you notice me. You pull me up a little more then you shout out get away from me! and let me go. My hand turned into a hybrids clawed hand. I sink, fighting it as best I could until youre out of sight.\"He finally looks at me. \"Dont take this the wrong way, but the dreams of losing you were the worst.\"I place a hand on his shoulder. \"You wont lose me.\"The thought of us ever parting never crossed my mind recently. True, the threat to friendship is usually high school, but we overcame that. Were still friends. And even though this story sounds convoluted, Harold was never good at acting. Something really spooked him.\"But you will,\" He counters. \"Tonight my father is coming to take me to Yha-nthlei, their domain. I am to remain there until…\"He is cut off by the sound of something sharp scratching against glass. We both stare at either window, but whatever made that noise had disappeared. Harold stood tense.\"Hes here, I have to go now.\"\"Youre just going to leave me? After everything youre just going to leave?\" I dont know where this is coming from. A part of me screams this should have been said sooner, but I suppose it was until that moment when the reality of the situation we found ourselves in finally sunk in.He looks as if hell cry. But then a thought comes to him.\"Tomorrow at Midnight…Ill meet you at the dock closest to Devils Reef.\"We embrace, silence prevails over all in that brief moment. He breaks away first and runs out into the night.Sleep evades me the rest of the night.VThe next day I hardly venture out into town. Partly because I dare not venture out into this cursed town. A town whos inhabitants, from what I gathered yesterday, did not like outsiders. Yet, strangely enough, I did not starve. Henrietta left goodies for me outside my door with a bill since I wrote on dusty stationary the room had left over that I could not take her charity.Despite being lonely, a sense of anxiety crept over me, for midnight was drawing near.At eleven thirty I ventured out into the night, the crescent moon illuminating my way towards the dock of which our meeting would take place.Once there I only wait a minute until I hear the sound of splashing and a thud of something landing on the dock a few feet behind me. I turn, expecting to see my friend to be as I remembered from last night. But alas, he is not and with a gasp I take him all in.Naked as the day he was born, his body covered in pale, robin eggshell blue, his stomach a pale white. His two eyes have enlarged and have become pitch black orbs. His lips have become fish-like, his gums holding rows of sharp teeth, framed nicely on his hairless head; hair being replaced with frills like that of fish fins. Yet, despite the fish-like qualities, it seemed that amphibian qualities were also present.He walks towards me in an awkward gait on his webbed toes until he is close enough to cup my cheek with his webbed, right hand.The gesture was merely for comfort and reassurance that he was still himself. I grasped his hand with my own and he lets out a purr-like hiss.\"Friend,\" He croaks, his voice coming out even more awkward than his gait, as if his vocal cords were not made for such a feat, yet was able to anyway. \"Missed you.\"\"Missed you, too, Harold.\" I admitted.\"Go back to Florida. Follow you.\" He growls. \"Others hate outsiders. Unless willing to mate with Deep One…\"He looked at me with what, to the average person, would look like a blank stare due to his black eyes. But from knowing him for as long as I have I caught the apprehension in his voice.\"No, nothing against you, Harold. But Id rather not.\"He made a sound that I guessed was their way of sighing, and in his case; it was in relief.\"Will go Florida, too. But…Some days I come back here.\" He grimaced as best he could with fish lips. \"Voice…Will better.\"I pat him on the shoulder. A low growl erupts from below us.\"Dad!\" Harold hisses, his frills on his head tense up in warning. But he pays his son no heed and I hear a thump. I gaze upon his father-a pale, green, hulking sea monster-and faint.VII travel back to Florida by hiking the way to Ipswich and hail a cab back to Boston where I fly back home and go about my business in minor isolation; breaking my hermitic lifestyle to go to work.

{"id": "EN055", "pair": ["Dry hacking. The sound assaults my ears, and makes my heart begin to flutter. Its unlike any paroxysm Ive ever heard, even when Theodora contracted pneumonia two years ago. Whats far worse is I know, instinctively, that it is not she whose body is wracked with illness. Its Lemuel Dawson, on his deathbed.\"Hold on!\" My voice is lighter, younger, not yet burdened with the weight of sorrow after his passing. Like any good nurse, I rush to his side and wipe the bloody spittle from his lips with a handkerchief. This is no mere dream; its a recollection, and thats exactly what I did back then. \"Im here as always, Father.\" \"Millie,\" he says weakly, and smiles through the pain of nearly-constant coughing. \"Come closer.\" I do, and wince at his fevered breath. \"Theres something that I must tell you, at long last.\" Every word of his is belabored. His voice reminds me of a desert wind, scorched with sand. Even his sickroom has that acrid air, as if we were in the middle of the Sahara instead of Massachusetts. I myself am hot, and know Father must be. However, I dare not leave his chamber to fetch a wet cloth for fear of missing his last words.\"They have come for me, and…you must know all that I do before they come for you. Find the keys,\" he says before being consumed with another coughing fit, \"in the bottom drawer of my desk. Bring them here.\" Again I follow his directions, yet hesitantly. Throughout his life, Father had been very particular about who was allowed to touch his personal possessions, and rummage through his desks and cabinets. Even our taciturn Theodora, whod never reveal any of his secrets even under duress, was forbidden from doing so. Father gave explicit instructions on which rooms were to be cleaned (kitchen, parlor, and so on), and which were not (his spartan bedroom after Mother died, and private study). Thats why it puzzles me, in this nighttime vision as well as in life, to hear him make such a request. Nevertheless, I hurry to obey it.It takes several tugs of the aforementioned bottom drawer, sticky with disuse, to get it to yield. When it does, I cough at the dust within and pull out a small iron ring with five keys. Each one of them is different, as keys naturally are, yet these five have been bent into the most curious shapes and configurations. Im tempted to stand beside the desk and stare at them to my hearts content, fingering their bizarre metal shafts, but Fathers waiting. Not knowing what hell tell me, or what he wants me to do with the keys, I take them over to his bedside. Greedily, he grasps them in his long fingers and takes my right hand in his.\"First,\" he announces, slipping one of the unique keys into my palm. \"Second,\" he then says, doing the same with another. \"Third. Closet. Church.\" With sudden horror, I realize what they open: the three locks to the door of his forbidden study, the closet within it, and the only church to which hes ever belonged. \"The one on Gallows Hill,\" he clarifies. I wonder why hes called it that instead of Cemetery Hill. Perhaps, now that hes facing his own hangman in the form of an illness that not even Leights doctor can diagnose, images of the Purge are haunting him. \"Read and learn all you can, when youre prepared. Take care.\" I couldnt stop myself: \"Why take care? Is something wrong? Who are they, Father? Please explain!\" \"It would take…too long.\" He slowly smiles, exposing all of his teeth in the white rictus of a deaths-head. Pressing the keys so firmly into my palm that they leave mild scrapes and indentations afterward, Father coughs once more. \"Believe.\" With that, his withered hand releases mine and falls to his side limply. He is no longer alive, and our conversation has drained me so much that I can do nothing but sob in fright.I wake up to find my pillow damp, and my eyes glistening. There is no one around save for me, and the all-encompassing darkness to hide my tears. Its been seventeen years, almost to the day, since Lemuel Dawson departed this mortal world. I feel ashamed of myself, because after nearly two decades, I should not be so stricken with grief. Father, at this point in time, should be a distant memory, a framed portrait on the wall of my house and mind. However, he is not. He has evidently remained with me, in a locked compartment of my mental faculties that only dreams can reopen. Why now? Why here, in this very Inn? If the keys that he gave me so long ago - and which Ive reconfined to the drawer from which I took them - are back in his old house, then why didnt I dream about them back there? This is too strange, and scary.When youre prepared, Father had told me, read and learn all you can. Prepared for what, I wonder?", "1945, 10 years after Smifts abduction. InnsmouthA man was running in a dark town. The chasers were holding torches and pitchforks. \"Go die you human scum!\" one of them growled, the young man was about to fire a pistol to this antagonistic chord when a knife reached the back of this heart. Before he could die he saw these enemies more closely, looking similar to humans, even using casual suits, but this faces were slightly distorted, with a bluish tinge and big eyes. These hands were very close to being webbed. One of them reaches the pockets of the corpses clothes, finding a diary with a logo in the middle: Miskatonic University.The next day. at Miskatonic, Massachusetts, Wilhelm Smift was very old, at the age of 68. He was in a bed resting this very frail body. He was accompanied by this young friend Johnathan Clarke. \"My dear friend, due to the fact that I will die, and I never had a family before…I will give to you the weapon that can protect humanity from the unknown. But please, pass some of my blood to you so he can perceive you as a member of my family, also you dont need to worry, my blood is not ill, I figured out that the Infinitely Timed Room makes you die of old age once you exited it, and due to the fact that my wife never could give me a child…and she is deceased, you will be my new successor\" Clarke used a syringe and injected some of the blood of this predecessor into himself. And then Wilhelm Smift died. The young would be teacher found himself sad, he knows that this mentor had told him of the physical god he mastered. But he wanted to learn more about not only physics but the alien technology as well, but he always told him that \"this mind would crack\" but how such an old fellow acquired such knowledge and remained sane? He departed to the basement, he knows that such places are only allowed to certain people, but Smift had told him that if he declared himself this son he would pass. The place was light by a single torch. To find a tall humanoid structure close to him, this shadow taller than any man he has seen. \"So my master had passed away…such a pity, I wanted to serve him more than no one.\" The voice was sly, and with a sharp tone. As this mentor said, but right now he sounded…sad? \"He was a great man, and me? Only an fucking killer…heh, its funny…how the good can die, alone and unnoticed…and they stay dead.\" he noticed John \"who we have here?\" he stared at the young man and in turn he noticed the mechanical being before him: this main body was cylindrical and red, with a single crimson cat like eye in the center of this \"head\" this arms have white with red colorations like the rest of this limbs, he had a large rectangular shield in this left arm, a set of three small red pouches and in the right a knife holder and the left a pistol holder, and a white cloth skirt. \"What is doing a brat in my home?\" he tried this best to gather mental strength and answer: \"I am the…son of Wilhelm Smift, he told me you would serve me\" the beast looked at him with this single blood colored eye, \"I can see trough you…and that is true, the Smift blood is in you kid, I mean master\" then the monster grabbed this pistol and started to show it at this server, \"so tell me, what shall I do? I am capable for killing anything\" he young man tried this best to organize this words and asks: \"why do you look different from what my father told me?\" the creature chuckles and says: \"heh, isnt it obvious? I wanted to look different cause I dont want to look like the jackasses that wanted me gone. They made this suit look like a fuckin asylum inmate . I was looking for something that suited me, so I left my dimension for one day. And I saw the perfect one, this one, why do you ask? cause I wanted a new look that minds insurrection?\" he pointed this white finger at the young man, that eye…its just like the devil itself was looking at him. \"And the eye?\" \"Oh…that was my…personal touch\" he started to laugh and this companion started to tremble. \"Dont be afraid kid…I dont bite, for much that I want to.\" Azathoth pointed at this \"face\" revealing that he doesnt have a mouth. Then he started to laugh like a maniac. He kid got out of the basement in fear. \"Hey dont get out! I was about to have tell you a great joke! MASTER!\"The next day…\"sire, we have bad news, Roy Urkam has…died\" a messenger told to this young chief, \"and who is that man, messenger?\" Clarke asks, \"He was a freelance investigator. He heard that something strange happened in Innsmouth so we sent him there, when I came this corpse was on a stick on the end of the road, when I asked they said: \"just a couple of kids that did it\" it was obvious that was a lie.\" The kid was…shocked but after scare from yesterday this was nothing. Suddenly a car was coming to the entrance, the occupants got out, they have guns and their eyes had watered eyes that were slightly out of their sockets. And they forced the main door down, \"thank god there are not students!\" the sire said, Clarke rushed to the basement and yelled the name of this protector and servant. \"INVASORS! COME AND KILL THEM! THEY HAVE GUNS!\" the young man yelled. \"Calm down master, I will go kick their skulls\" he got out of this dark lair and he readied this colt pistol and this knife. \"Come here! I can sense cowardly in this place!\" suddenly a blaze of bullets came from the outside of the campus. \"I think I need a bigger gun\" he turned this back and then a rectangular and red colored heavy machine gun was grabbed from this holster, the weapon was so tall as the cylinder body of this user and it looked different from any gun ever made: it had a slightly bended square in this top. This barrel had holes and this body was metallic instead of wood. Then he got out of the building and he saw these enemies \"Deep ones!\" they started to fire but it was useless, the bullets just bounce this tick metal skin. He started firing and he shot 4, the other ones tried to run to the car. \"NO YOU WONT!\" Azathoth yelled and he used this incredible strength and stomped the vehicle. \"Now we can start this party!\" the half deep ones tried to counter attack with this pistols but nothing changed. Azathoth grabbed one and crushed this skull with these bare hands, he shot three to death with this colt and machine gun; he blazed 1 to death with a thick cylindrical magenta/red heat ray that emanated from this crimson eye. \"COME ON! GIVE ME A CHALENGE!\" he yelled, and then he realized that only one was left. \"Oh…damn I wanted a massacre. Well my good friend, come here\" but before he can grab this new prisoner a bullet came to this skull, Azathoth saw that 2 more cars came. \"Oh…YES MORE FUN!\" he welcomed this new \"guests\" with this heat ray; a few ones changed their ammo and used armor piercing. The bullets were now making dents in the body of the armored god. But then they started to self-repair. \"YES, this is the real deal!\" he did 4 head shots and destroyed the two cars that came with this heat ray, some of the half fish men tried to enter the house from the back, but they saw with horror a large creature with a vertical mouth and large pink eyes located in both parts of the divided head, he had two right arms fused into one and two left that were identical, with large nails. The main body was shaggy with black and some purple hair. \"What in Dagons name is that!\" one of them asked before being eaten by the giant. The ex-outer god was enjoying like a maniac that the cars that he fried had some occupants and they got out of them showered in flames \"THATS WHAT I CALL EXTRA CRISPY!\" the daemon yelled to this frightened fish enemies. Only 5 were left and they tried to run to the exit, but before that can happen Azathoth flicked this finger and the giant vertical mouth monster appeared and lunged to the remaining ones and eaten them. Only one was left…again. \"Gug, go were you belong\" Azathoth flicked this fingers again and the monstrosity disappeared. \"Thanks CLAXTON, thanks Bertie\" he returned to the university. It had some gun holes but nothing that can be easily repaired.\"Hey master, are you in one piece?\" he asked to the young that was in the ground. He grabbed the shocked boy and handed him to the messenger. Put him in this home. He grabbed the survivor knocked him down with a flick of this finger and put him in the jail of the basement \"Well…that was exiting\""]}
{"id": "EN095", "pair": ["Hanoi, Socialist Republic of VietnamJune 24, 2011.\"Hey, were here. Get up if you dont want to wake up in Hue!\"Joseph Clayton was shaken awake by the hand of one of his classmates on his shoulder. He was sitting in the back of a taxi van... the only one left sitting, actually, as the others had already disembarked to enter the government office they were parked in front of.Which probably meant that he was left to pay the fare.After he payed (as seemed to be his lot on this trip), he followed his classmates and his professor into the government office where they hoped to finally receive their travel permits. He hadnt gotten much of sleep on the plane; a mixture of excitement in the face of overseas travel and sheer jet-lag had conspired to leave him weary and light headed until he got a few hours sleep, which the taxi ride had partially afforded him.And in that sleep...The dream had come as a stark, clear memory. When Marie had said that she wasnt going to join him at the Miskatonic campus in Arkham for what would be their first year of university, he had been devastated. His first questions, rushed and frantic, had been about the cause of such a change. She certainly had the SAT score to qualify and student debt could be handled with relative ease. Had she decided to forgo post-secondary to concentrate on her stake in the restaurant? Had financial problems struck and prevented admissions from being paid?Was it something about him?Her answers, far more controlled than his frenzied speculation, had all been in the negative. Her SAT scores were good, student loans were still open and she still intended to go for a degree in Biology at Miskatonic. It was just... after shed gotten that phonograph from her parents home village, the repayment had been a promise to come and spend a year back in the \"Old Country\" as soon as she could. It would only be for a year and then she would return, ready for university and all accompaniments.That had been very nearly one year before. She had promised him that she would be coming back in the summer of 2011... but after she had arrived in Vietnam, all contact had stopped cold. Her parents, when asked about her condition, always responded with affirmations that she would return and that she was fine... but as winter wore onto spring, subtle hints of doubt and worry had crept into their voices. Had they even been receiving any news from their daughter and if not, then why not? Had something gone terribly wrong?As it happened, more baffling events awaited inside.\"What do you mean, restricted?\" Joseph asked the Communist Party bureaucrat sitting across the desk from him. Of course, due to the facts that first, said bureaucrat was a government employee and second, they were not alone in the room, Joseph had been careful not to sound too brunt in his tone. A trung sior Sergeant, wearing the forest green uniform of the Vietnam Border Defence Force (VPA), stood by the door of the office, both watching and guarding.Relieved at being able to shed his stilted English after Joseph exhibited a decent grasp of the Vietnamese language, the bureaucrat put forth what he knew of the situation. \"Civilian access is almost completely denied inside the area you requested. To be honest, that section of the border has been troublesome ever since the war. We get reports of smugglers, poachers, bandits, Hmong insurgents... every type of violent counter-revolutionary you can think of, this region seems to have it. The local Bru farmers arent much help, but they generally dont bother others and seem to accept the military presence we keep there.\" The bureaucrat shifted his gaze from Joseph to Professor Neville Andover, the leader of this particular expedition. \"Im sorry, but theres nothing that can be done without high level authorization.\"As a response to this, Neville Andover did not get upset. He did not resign himself to failure. He did not even try to ask if there was any other avenue of entry or way to access the information he needed. He just donned an odd, amused smile, the corners of his eyes crinkling behind his wire rim glasses. \"I assume that General Vo is still the Secretary for the Border Forces?\" He asked, almost distractedly. When the official answered yes, Professor Andover reached into the inside of his light cotton jacket and pulled out a small, metal case. From this case, he removed a single paper card of purest black, embossed with an emerald green \"Delta\" symbol and a capital \"Y\" of gold in the center of that hollow triangle. \"I have been in contact with Comrade Vo for the last six months, planning this expedition as an act of cooperation between our two governments and as a boon for my University. He knows that card; show it or describe it to him... you maywant to run it by General Tran as well. Either way, they will give you the answer you need.\"As the bureaucrat took the card and then as the Border Defense sergeant took it from him and headed out of the room, Joesph wondered about his professor and the oddities that surrounded him. The first time he had ever seen the Professor, it had been in his High School Auditorium as Marie had performed the Stork Dance... and Joseph had noticed strange things. In their senior year of High School, both he and Marie had received reference letters to Miskatonic University in Arkham, a town in Essex county. When he had arrived at Miskatonic (without Marie), he had been shocked that the professor for his Cultural Anthropology class was not only the one who had given him his reference but was also the man who had he had seen three years before.And then there were his classmates, three of whom had also come on this expedition. Many of them had received similar letters from Prof. Andover and most of those, though not relaying specifics, had said that they had found the circumstances equally strange. Two who had gotten references were on this very trip with them. The first was Tracy Williams from the farm country of Northwest Virginia, a girl with blond hair quite a few shades lighter than Josephs own brassy brown and the class Nippon-Nut, being both obsessed with Anime and Manga as well as being Japanese-proficient. The second was Albert Noyes, a young man who has part white, part black and a little Algonquin-Indian from a small hamlet in southern Vermont. His specialties were technology, math and Mandarin Chinese. The third member of retinue was a young man named Malone who... frankly, was a mystery to the entire class. However, he had volunteered for this trip and his grades had been excellent so his place on the roster had been assured.But there was still a nagging question at the back of his mind: why? Why had they received offers to go to an obscure if admittedly exceptional regional university when the big names had all passed them over? Why had they been gathered from all across the United States by a single professor? And why, it seemed, did it feel like there was such a big connection between the missing member of Dr. Andovers \"collection\" and the reason behind this expedition?Why did it feel as if Marie was somehow connected to this?Eventually, the sergeant came back and informed the bureaucrat of General Vos express permission for the Professor and his students to enter the exclusion zone as well as General Trans confirmation, before handing the card back to Neville Andover. Joseph knew that academics could sometimes have friends in high and unusual places, but counting on ... no, expecting the approval of not just one, but two ranking Generals in a non-allied nation? This seemed crazy, certifiably insane even.But then, so did spectral storks and spoonbills.Northernmost Quang Binh Province, Socialist Republic of VietnamJune 29, 2011Despite the calm look on the professors face, something about the current situation made Joseph Clayton distinctly ill at ease.They had spent the last two days trudging up into the Annamite mountains after leaving the fertile coastal plain. At the last village with road access, they had ditched their vehicles and backpacked up the ridges and trails, counting on a guide from the local Bru people to lead them to... whatever Prof. Andover was looking for. The fact that the guide was now legging it quite quickly back down the misty path told Joseph that something had either gone incredibly wrong or incredibly right.Now, Neville Andover was chanting, seemingly trying to communicate with something deep in the thick underbrush on either side of the worn, overgrown gully that had been called a trail. The language was almost intellig ible to Joseph, being a form of Mon-Khmer linked to the classical Vietnamese he had studied, perhaps with a few hints of Muong intermixed. However, the syntax and grammer were archaic to say the least. From some of the words used it even seemed to be achingly familiar, almost as if...With a sudden realization of shock and the smell of grilled pork and Bac Bon Dzhow a memory in his nostrils, Joseph realized where he had encountered this form of Vietic before.But the shocks were not over.Spun around by Albert Noyes to see something, Joseph gazed upward to see a human figure standing upon the high bank, glancing down at them with hard, measuring eyes. Undoubtedly masculine, the figure was of a man of slightly darker skin than the farmers of the coast (though the features were similar) and of greater height than either them or the native Bru. Clothed only in a white cotton kilt with geometric designs in black and a leather girdle, this man carried a white flatbow decorated with bands of green, blue and red while a bronze dagger rested at his hip. His head was shaved of all hair, and black designs were tattooed from the crown of the scalp to the jawline, with more tattoos covering his arms, chest and lower legs.The fact that an arrow was nocked in the string of his bow put the four young people on edge, with Malone and Joesph himself tightening the grips on the hilts of their machetes in anticipation of a hopeless fight. More men in similar dress and tattoos, some with bronze slashing swords, some with bronze-headed spears and others with flatbows, appeared out of the forest on either side of them. Now that Joseph could get a better look at them in the dim light filtering down through the forest canopy and the mist, their arm tattoos began looking very similar to those borne by Maries parents while those on their faces, while different in design, were still similar in form.All the while, Prof. Andover kept up the low chanting, of which Joseph could pick out individual words: \"friend\", \"gods\", \"village\", \"priest\", \"comrade\" and at least one invocation of Ho Chi Minh among them. To this, these strange men seemed to confer with each other though glances and nods before took one took a short, bamboo tube from his girdle, put one end to his mouth, took a deep breath and blew.As the silvery-blue powder erupted from the tube, settled on the heads of the trekking academics and they each lost consciousness in turn, Joseph wondered if this could get any worse.Meanwhile, Spoonbill VillageTsan Pho Dao had been the Chief Priest of this village for many years, ever since the death of his father in the closing days of the American War. In that span of years, he had seen many futures and advised his people based on those futures. He had called down both ruin and plenty by invoking the power of the gods of his people. He alone, in a feat outside even the power of the hereditary village chiefs, had communicated with the Instrument of their gods, a being possessed of both boundless knowledge and an absolutely rotten temper. He also, most importantly, had an absolutely perfect memory of his entire life... and that of his father, and his father before him.To be perfectly honest, he held a tremendous amount of power within this village. The ancestor shrines belonged to families while the hunters had their own little shrines up the mountain where midnight rituals were performed to gather poison for the tips of arrows and darts. But those rituals needed to be performed by the minor priests under his command. This temple was the spiritual center of his people for most of the year and the temple with its darkened wood walls lit only by feeble braziers whose light was twisted by the smoke of rare and powerful incenses, with its figurines of gods and demons carved from nephrite and jadeite brought from deep below the earth... was his domain. His and no one else. He divined the future when possible, he performed the rites and as a result, it was he who had taken countless lives in sacrifice over the course of his adulthood: chickens, pigs, goats, buffalo... people.As he sat at a low table in his private sanctuary, trying to divine some course for a question that had faced him for most of a year, he noticed something. One of the golden discs he used for divination, a coin looted from a Chinese caravan many centuries ago, stood up on its rim and began to roll. Following the curve of failing momentum, the coin finally came to rest at a specific point on the table, a place that held indication of the future.Visitors... and not the \"ketchup\" kind of visitors.Several Hours Later, Close to the Laos BorderThe answer to Joseph Claytons earlier question was a definite yes. When he had awoken, he had found his wrists and ankles bound, the bindings looped over a pole carried by two men with him and the other students suspended like deer carcasses. The Professor, on the other hand, had not been bound, but had found transport by sitting in a large basket suspended from one of the poles by a cord, carried by a pair of men. They had been going downhill from the crest of a ridge and were now leaving the forest, coming onto a road. First, they passed under a wooden gate where roosting spoonbills had been carved into the posts and a sun flanked by two dragons had been carved into the beams above the road.Then Joseph saw where they were headed. A village of perhaps thirty houses was visible in the valley bottom while narrow terraces had been cut into the hills above, green with growing rice. The view quickly vanished as the men began heading into the village itself but sight was soon replaced with sound. The quiet of the forest was supplanted by the cacophony of a hundred sounds: chickens and pigs grunted and clucked as the animals rooted below the houses and around the garbage heaps while odd-looking reddish dogs, lazing in the sun on the porches of the outermost houses, whined in surprise at the new arrivals. The sounds of tools and primitive machinery clunked melodiously. The sounds of people also were audible: talking, laughing, shouting and even a few low notes of womens work songs were possible for Joseph to pick out of the general buzz... a buzz which also included Albert trying to reason with their captors and Tracy displaying an unusually foul mouth toward same.Soon, people began to notice the men bringing in captives and a few even began to gather along the path as they entered the village, joining their dogs (or Dholes, as they were now identifiable as) who had come to sniff. It was mostly men, older boys and children who came out to watch while the women and the elderly usually went no further than windows and the porches of the stilt-houses that lined the road. Here, even hanging upside down, Joseph could notice a few things about the dress and appearance of the peopleFrankly... it was a bit odd.From what he knew, the Vietnamese national costume (in its modern form) placed a heavy emphasis on trousers, an item of clothing that he noticed was rather conspicuously absent here. Everyone here seemed to be wearing variations on one basic outfit in either brown or black: knee-length cotton kilts, short-sleeved cotton jackets (mostly with their front fastenings closed) and either rough-woven conical hats or simple cloths tied over their heads. The mens hair appeared to be cut short to the point where one could vaguely make out the tattoos on their scalp while children varied between the same shortness for boys and a single, long braid for the girls.Eventually they arrived in a great or square before what appeared to be the temple: a ponderous structure of wood and brick perched upon massive stone foundations, its sloping roofs flaring outward as if to shroud the surrounding houses from the scrutiny of the heavens. Around them, a crowd had gathered on all sides, an air of excitement buzzing in the air. Men exited the house across the square from the temple entrance and despite the calm demeanour of Professor Andover, words began filtering through to Joseph that began sounding more and more disturbing; words like \"kill\", \"sacrifice\" and \"ritual\". But another word came, one that sent darker imaginings and images rambling through his sensation-saturated mind.The word \"eat\".\"WAIT! STOP!\"Joseph knew those words as well... as well as that voice!Out of the crowd rushed a figure dressed much like the others: brown kilt and jacket, the latter partially open to reveal a yem undergarment and with a straw hat on her head. As Joseph finally began taking in other details, he noticed the tattooed lines and whimsical designs on her lower legs and arms and on her face, lines and vaguely triangular patterns that almost resembled the features of an orangutan.Her face... behind all the tattooing, the face of this woman was still as unmistakable to Joseph as the first day they had met in Kindergarten. To this sudden recognition, the young man could only exclaim his surprise as a soothingly familiar name.\"Marie?\"", "Spoonbill Village, Northernmost Quang Bin Province, SRVJune 29, 2011As the two young adults stared at each other, nothing but shock registered in either of their brains. Not the stares of the villagers nor of Josephs classmates affected them in their surprise. For Joseph, the shock was mixed with relief at finding his girlfriend safe, concern about his own impending fate as the main course and a strange confusion about what the heck was going on. For Marie, it was the sheer shock of actually seeing her boyfriend here and her puzzlement at the reason why that added to her numb bewilderment, not to mention the fear for his life at what might happen next.As the shock broke, she knew that she had to act. And since the village chief was here...\"You cannot sacrifice this man! His family are allies are of my parents, his parents are involved in our business. If anything happens to him, calamity will come upon us all!\" Demanding such things of the chieftain might have been rude, presumptuous and even insulting, but everything she said was the truth. If Joseph died, things would go down the toilet very quickly.Before the men could answer back, the crashing of a great bronze gong echoed over the crowd and all heads turned towards the source of the cacophony, the temple. Coming down the steps was a red lacquered palanquin with red curtains. Four men in deeply-hooded red robes supported the wooden structure, its bracing poles upon their shoulders. As they reached the courtyard proper, one of the warriors who had exited the large house went up to the palanquin, distinguished from the others by leather shoes on his feet, a broad circlet of gold around his black head-wrap and a single pheasant tail feather standing erect at the forefront of this headdress. Joseph could distinguish some sort of conversation happening, the words too quiet to make out. For several tense seconds he, Marie, his classmates and his professor waited for what would happen.What happened was that from this man, the villages hereditary chief, the order was given for them to be spared... for now. Another order was given to separate them and hold them in isolation until a final decision could be made.As Joseph was carried away into a side street, he could almost glimpse Marie following the palanquin into the Temple, including his Professor, still sitting in his basket.Several Hours LaterJoseph could never fully recall all of the things that he had pondered in those hours, sitting with his hands and feet bound, alone in that dark storehouse, smelling of rice and preserved vegetables. He had found Marie and as he had suspected for a number of years, she apparently belonged to a semi-unique culture of Vietic speakers in her purported homeland of the Annamite Range. What came as a surprise was that they apparently, if the few bits of coherent speech he had heard were any indication, practiced some sort of ritualized homicide and may well be inclined toward the consumption of \"long pork\"... and at the moment, that could include him.Eventually the door opened and soft, yellow light flooded the room, illuminating bags of rice and strings of hanging vegetables. In the doorway was Marie, carrying a paper covered lantern in one hand, a bronze bowl in the other and now hat-less. As he had briefly noticed earlier, the muscles on her limbs now had a definition to them that hadnt existed back in Glaston, her frame slightly more lean than the apprentice cook that he remembered. She was dressed just as she had been before, was still tattooed everywhere he could see and, as she she came over to where he was sitting, the light in the lantern seemed more like... fireflies than any kind of flame.\"So... nice place you have here.\" He hoped that starting slow could take some of the edge off the dangerous situation in which he now faced himself.\"Yeah... it is nice, I guess.\" Marie put the bowl (now seen to be carrying water) and the lantern on the ground beside him and knelt to untie his bonds. \"Im sorry that you got dragged into this. When I borrowed that record... I had no idea that...\" She closed her eyes and sighed in a way that, to Joseph, made the tattoos on her face dance almost... alluringly. \"Theres a lot that I just couldnt tell you when we were younger. My people are used to hiding... maybe tooused to it by now. I want to tell you so much, but I... I dont know where to begin.\"\"Then start from the beginning. That always seems to be how its done in the movies.\" Rubbing his wrists and ankles to get the circulation back, Joseph wondered just what he was going to hear.What he heard was everythingabout her people, the stories she had enraptured Cora with plus a whole lot of other stuff, fantastic and gruesome in equal measure. The human sacrifice, the ritual cannibalism, the intermittent persecution by Chinese, Champa, Viet and French over the last two thousand years... nothing was left out. As he sipped water from the bowl, she described how her peoples ancestors had been Au Lac refugees from the Red River Valley, driven south into the mountains by the invading Qin Chinese. On the edge of total starvation, they had been saved when a spirit animal, a black water buffalo cow with a seemingly endless number of calves trailing behind, had emerged from the highland jungle at the chanting of animist shamans travelling with the group.Behind those spectral buffalo had emerged their wonder and salvation: men in red robes with the legs of goats, monks from a far, high land called Leng. These strange people, who called themselves Shugoran, had taught this diverse group of farmers, mountain peoples, priests, urbanites and servants many useful magics: how to grow up to twelve crops of rice per year, how to draw water and metal from the earth, how to commune with the forces of the universe and not annoy them too severely, how to pass perfect memories from father to son, how to ensure the fertility of people, livestock and game and how to armor a persons skin so as to stop any blade or spear or arrow or sling stone.It was this last spell, combined with the requirement in orthodox Shugoran magic for Human (or similar) sacrifice and cannibalism that brought on the next mess. When the Qin Dynasty collapsed under the weight of the first emperors paranoia and his successors incompetence, suicide and the resultant power struggle, the men of the new \"Leng Viet\" decided to press their advantage. They launched a guerrilla campaign in an attempt to drive the Trieu Dynasty, with its mixed nobility of native southerners and Han Chinese, out of the Red River valley and establish a new native state.Over the next hundred years, men raided trade routes and army barracks in the guise of screaming, bare-chested, tattooed (associated with bandits and convicts by the Chinese) savages, dragging captives off into the night or the forest in order to sacrifice them for either civilian or military magic. When they eventually lost their \"War of the Bandits\" (from the threefold causes of not getting any local nobility on their side, of terrifying the pants off their Viet kinsmen with their ferocity and the rumours of their religion and by the sheer weight of the eventual re-invasion by the armies of the Han Dynasty) they fled deep into the mountains of the West and South, being chided by the last of the original, goat-legged sorcerers for their foolish, ill-planned ambitions. From then, they had remained hidden and relatively peaceful, though remembered in whispered folk-tales as vicious, man-eating monsters.After Marie had finished. Joseph sat in silence for a few minutes, digesting what he had just heard. The whole thing about magic was a bit.. hard to swallow. However, his own eyes had seen things that most would say were impossible. \"You dont... you dont hate me now, do you?\" Marie suddenly asked, her face awash in a worried panic, perhaps the culmination of every bout of anxiety she had ever experienced when Joseph had began edging onto the subject of her peoples true nature. So much worry, so much fear and one wrong move now could break her heart.For once, just once, he initiated the kiss this time.\"Does that answer your question?\" As they pulled apart, he could see that most of her anxieties had melted away. \"And... I hesitate to mention this, but about your parents restaurant...\" He stopped when he saw her face, now an annoyed, knowing grimace that indicated that the next words out of his mouth should be chosen very carefully. \"Uh... about the chicken, beef and pork they used. Was any of it... officiallysacrificed?\"Maries grimace let up. \"You need a priest to do anything official, and my parents are from farming families. Dont worry, we never served anyone up as the main course.\" She actually began to smile as she stood upright.\"Alright... but speaking of the main course, what about...\" Joseph gulped nervously. \"Me? Am I still going to be barbecue or did you actually convince anyone otherwise?\"The next news out of Maries mouth was welcome indeed. \"I didnt, but your professor won your life and those of the others after he talked with our Chief Priest. If Im right, he and the rest of your team should be at the house of my paternal grandparents. Who arethey, anyway?\"\"My classmates. The Anthropology department at Miskatonic organized this trip with Professor Andover and a couple of us volunteered. \" Still holding the bowl, Joseph began standing, his limbs still stiff and numb from hours of sitting. Despite this discomfort and the twitching shocks that came when blood began flowing free again, he followed her out the door, though not before taking and slinging a bag of rice over his shoulder at her asking, along with a braid of garlic bulbs and a small box of dried pork on a cord.During his captivity, Joseph had been held in one of the storehouses by the river, a short way north of the village. Now, in the waning light of dusk, he and Marie made their way back on the path that wove through vegetable gardens and pig-pens until they reached the outlying houses. Through narrow alleys between house stilts and below the sounds of evening meals being eaten, past dogs and pigs drowsing in the under-crofts and along the great outer wall of the temple they traveled before moving into the main square and down the main thoroughfare.\"It should be just after this next left, right across from the bronze-smith.\" As they walked along, they came to an intersection. On their right was a large house facing the street, belonging to the village bronze-smith and acting as a shop, a workplace and his family home. Across the main street from that house was a side street, lined by mostly smaller houses but each of them with soft lights in their windows. A few houses in, Marie led Joseph up the stairs of one house where familiar voices were laughing and making merry, including one brash female voice in particular that Joseph had come to know well.As Marie lay down the lantern on the porch and opened the door, the voices became louder and clearer. When they entered, everyone was already seated (or at least kneeling). Albert and Malone were trading stories of their brief imprisonment and what they had seen, while Tracy was working her way through a bowl of green tea, apparently trying to cajole her way into the rice whiskey. Professor Andover was making small conversation with an old village man sitting at the head of the table who was wearing the brown jacket and skirt combo that was so common. Also at the table was a younger man and his wife, maybe a little older than Maries parents, along with two teenage sons who had not yet received their tattooing. Some ways from the table, an elderly woman worked at a hearth lined with stone and brick, stoking a carefully controlled charcoal fire.Everyone looked up at the new arrivals. The first to speak was the old man who had been talking to the professor, telling Marie to bring the rice and other ingredients over to the charcoal hearth so the evening meal could begin and then for them to sit down. After that was done, Joseph noticed that people were looking at him.Apparently, it was time to make introductions.\"Joseph, Id like you to meet my family on my fathers side.\" After explaining that few of them could understand any English at all, Marie started introducing them. First came the old man, now identified as her paternal grandfather. Her grandmother, his wife, was the woman starting tending the fire at the hearth, her gray hair in an elaborate bun at the back of the head held together with a set of jade hairpins and wearing a long, black dress, similar to the garment that Marie had worn at the performance. Maries uncle Huy and his wife An sat across from the Miskatonic students and beside them sat Cuong and Thao, their two sons...Only two?\"Damn, the Kids!\" Marie had been so busy with her boyfriend that the absence her younger cousins had escaped her until now. She got back up and went to the door, opened it and called down the street for them to get in the house now and try not to spill the water they were carrying. As she returned to where she had been kneeling, many hurried footsteps were heard coming up the outside stairs and the door opened again as five children entered as a crowd. The oldest, a girl who was perhaps eleven years old, was carrying two bronze pails of water in her hands while the second oldest, a boy of maybe ten, was carrying two more.In fact, all the kids, which included two more boys and another girl, seemed to each be about a year apart down to a little boy of about seven years old. \"Big families the norm around here?\" Joseph asked his girlfriend as the water was transferred to cooking vessels and the ingredients collected.Marie shrugged. \"More or less: most farming families have at least three kids nowadays but the norm used to be around five around a century ago. This family is weird both ways: My uncle and aunt for having so many and my parents for just having me.\" Of course, sooner or later this casual reminiscing had to end. \"So, Professor...\" Tracy began, consciously deciding to get back on topic from the revery the two had been involved in. \"You Said that you had something to tell us, about the ultimate purpose of this expedition?\"Neville Andover smiled the way that someone delivering a great and terrible revelation does. \"As a matter of fact, I did.\" He motioned towards Malone, who was now extremely attentive. \"This is Malone Roberts; for the last year he has been playing the part of my student, but he is far more than that. He is my assistant, my cohort... my protege in the context of the agency I work for. Tell me...\" He seemed to direct this as every member of the audience (save Malone) who could speak English. \"Have any of you heard of Delta Green?\"\"Whats that? Something in the Marine Corps?\" It had soundedlike an innocent question from Ms. Williams, but Joseph had shared a class, study groups and cram sessions with her for many months, and could recognize the first signs of building stress and panic when he saw them. They were amazingly similar to the signs that Marie herself had shown, with the difference of gripping objects such as a table edge with white-knuckle intensity now apparent.\"Its surprising that you havent heard of it, considering the contacts in your community and the agencies reputation for... extreme measuresbefore 1960.\" Now Andover turned to Albert Noyes. \"Perhaps you have some notion of it... or its partner agency, Majestic 12. It is quite amazing work theyre doing on the Yuggoth Project, especially on fungi.\" This seemed like it was crammed with potential clues, but honestly, Joseph couldnt make heads or tails of it.Noyes, on the other hand, apparently could. He began smiling in surprise and recognition and began laughing at the revelation. \"You mean... you know about the Migo?\" Now Joseph was confused beyond all reckoning, and apparently so were Marie and Tracy.\"Know aboutthem, know some of them, occasionally work alongside them. And if I may say, for half-fungus, half-arthropod, telepathic pains in the rear, they are remarkably easy to work with.\" What followed was Albert explaining the situation: the weirdest kinds of aliens you could imagine had contacted some humans in the 1800s and hired them to assist in mining certain valuable minerals in the hills of Vermont and Maine. Over the years, the men and women in their employ had received advice from these aliens as to potential marriage partners, first in terms genetic compatibility and superior traits for their offspring, then based on attractiveness as their understanding of human reproductive psychology increased. Finally, as they realized the subtle psychological and social rules of courtship, the began acting as human elites once did, organizing parties for unattached men and women and subtly directing candidates certain ways as they piloted artificial human body-shells around the dance floor. It sounded weird... but reassuring, even humorous. Even Tracy seemed to lighten up... as far as a hunted rabbit couldlighten up.\"Mr. Clayton here is what you may call normal. However, he was privy to manifestations not usual of this Earth.\" Joseph then told the assembled of what he had witnessed, with Professor Andover hypothesizing that the phonograph may have projected images and smells by some means of eldritch energies. Marie also retold the story of her people and of the deal that she had agreed to to gain access to the phonograph: one year back in the village and receiving her tattoos of adulthood. Nothing more and nothing less had been asked of her.\"And finally, we have Ms. Williams, whose tale has much to do with the founding of the organization and its present form.\" Here, Andover seemed to realize what kind of anxiety the girl was going through, and thus went slowly. \"In the winter of 1928, the Miskatonic faculty was contacted by the United States Army to help investigate a series of strange attacks and abductions in Paige County, Virginia. As the base was in a primarily Quaker area, Miskatonic sent its lone member of faculty who was a Friend, one Hiriam Willows of Boston. While he remained among the Quaker farmfolk who knew the habits of the attacks, the army waged war against what was first believed to be a \"degenerate\" tribe of Iroquois but were later found to be white members of a strange fertility cult which engaged in human sacrifice.\"The academic glanced towards Tracy, who had lowered her head, closed her eyes and grimaced at what was surely to come. He turned back to his eager listeners. \"Before Willows left, he discovered strange objects in a secret room at the Longhouse Meeting Hall... objects which resembled those found on the slain cultists. He also, inadvertently, stumbled upon his hosts engaged in a ritual of apparent mourning, dressed as the Southern Iroquois would have been three hundred years ago, sacrificing pigs upon an altar at an isolated circle of standing stones, wailing and keening in grief.\" He looked back at Tracy. \"This was the experience which convinced him that not all who worship the base forces of the universe are driven to evil nor insanity. It was also the experience that not all things should be released to the world, both for the worlds safety and that of the subjects.\"After a moments silence, Tracy spoke. \"Excuse me.\" She got up walked out the door, somewhat to the surprise of her classmates, Marie and Maries family. Marie then got up and went to follow, an act which inevitably drew Joseph after her.They found Tracy sitting at the bottom of the steps, her chin on one balled fist, her other arm across her lap, her eyes staring into some unfathomable distance. Marie went forward first, sitting beside the girl as Joseph hung back. \"I dont think weve been introduced. My names Marie.\" When Tracy didnt answer. \"You know, you dont have to feel bad about what other people did. Those guys the Army killed werent your people, no matter how similar your rituals may have been.\"\"But they weremy people.\" The answer came suddenly and surprised both listeners.\"Pardon?\" Asked Joseph from the middle of the stairway.\"Those dangerous cultists that the professor told you about; they were English, Quakers even... or had been at one time.\" She sighed, not quite sure of herself on how to explain to outsiders the issue which had plagued her fears since the age of 10. \"They were my peoples kin, descendants of those of us who answered the Union armies call for guerrillas during the Civil War. Before that, wed adopted some sacrificial ritual from the Iroquois during the 1720s after some very hard winters. Where before theyd killed dogs, black deer and captured warriors... as well as captured women and children if it got reallybad... to get good crops and health, we imposed strict limits and rules. There was to be no more human sacrifice, we killed our own livestock and above all, we accept the rituals as a gift from on high... even if the whole Christ thing was supposed to render sacrifice obsolete.\"\"Id consider it a divine door prize. But about the Civil War?\" Marie was trying to make the talk as nonthreatening as possible, considering the darkness which had settled over the village.Getting back on topic, Tracy continued. \"Well, wed already been hiding escaped slaves for years on their way up to the major escape routes in Pennsylvania, but we felt that we couldnt do any more, especially with so much Confederate presence in the Shenandoah and the internecine aggression over secession. These people though... they wanted to do something. So, when a few Union officers wanted a meeting, they snuck off north. And when they came back, they brought otherthings with them. Old medieval codices which described Druidic rituals shockingly similar to our own but twisted and brutal, rituals which needed terror to be inflicted in the victims so that the full power of their life force could be drained. Their attitudes had changed as well; they became disdainful of the rest of the community: calling them weak, cowards, savages who refused to possess the full power of the Star Daughter and the Black Stag, fools who held onto their petty delusions of morality. Well, after they went and made a mess of everything by capturing and sacrificing a Confederate squadron... the rest of the Longhouse Quakers shunned them, bidding them to go into the high mountains until they were ready to return. And so, a collection of about 50 men, women and children left the Valley and went into the high woods.\"Joseph put something together in his head. \"And I take it that the next time they returned was 60 years later, crazier than ever.\"Tracy harrumphed. \"Youve got that right. And think about this while youre at it: by the 1920s, wed been isolated for so long that it was starting to show in our features; the more inbred we became, the leaner our faces and the bonier our joints. By the time Willows got there, we just looked skinny and somewhat malnourished and with the right connections a few decades later, that began to get fixed.\" Her face got hard. \"But what if Willows had finked on us, or Miskatonic sent one of their Congregationalist mamas boys instead? Do you realize what may have happened to us, especially in the 20s or 30s? Arresting us for a start, probably followed by forced sterilization and throwing us in crazy houses, sanitariums and prisons to rot. And thats just the adults!\"She was getting visibly angry. \"Their kids, my great-grandparents, would have been shuffled off to orphanages or perhaps boarding schools if they thought we were just really pale Indians.\" She shuddered. \"Ive read about the shit that happened in Canadas residential school system and it gave me just as many nightmares as the thought of my ancestors being hunted like wolves and tortured for things they never did or for who they were.\" She turned to look at Marie and for the first time since he knew her, Joseph could put a name (that name being \"very mildly inbred\") on the features which he had labeled as rural-attractive or cute in a farmers daughter kind of way. \"I know that your people have been hiding, but at least you guys made the mistake of acting like total jerks to get your reputation! We never did anything wrong.\"With that, Tracy got up, passed her companions and just as she was about to reenter the house, she paused and rethought something. \"Well, never did anything wrong besides burning down that chicken barn, but that was an emergency! Neither my aunt nor my little cousin would be here if not for that and besides...\" She turned her head to look at Joseph and Marie. \"They wrote it off as an electrical fire.\" As Tracy went back into the house, Joseph thought that, while going against all conventional reason, his life made perfect sense for the first time in a very long while."]}
{"id": "EN036", "pair": ["III. A Search and an Evocation1.Charles Ward, as we have seen, first learned in 1918 of his descent from Joseph Curwen. That he at once took an intense interest in everything pertaining to the bygone mystery is not to be wondered at; for every vague rumour that he had heard of Curwen now became something vital to himself, in whom flowed Curwens blood. No spirited and imaginative genealogist could have done otherwise than begin forthwith an avid and systematic collection of Curwen data.      In his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at secrecy; so that even Dr. Lyman hesitates to date the youths madness from any period before the close of 1919. He talked freely with his family - though his mother was not particularly pleased to own an ancestor like Curwen - and with the officials of the various museums and libraries he visited. In applying to private families for records thought to be in their possession he made no concealment of his object, and shared the somewhat amused scepticism with which the accounts of the old diarists and letter-writers were regarded. He often expressed a keen wonder as to what really had taken place a century and a half before at that Pawtuxet farmhouse whose site he vainly tried to find, and what Joseph Curwen really had been.      When he came across the Smith diary and archives and encountered the letter from Jedediah Orne he decided to visit Salem and look up Curwens early activities and connexions there, which he did during the Easter vacation of 1919. At the Essex Institute, which was well known to him from former sojourns in the glamorous old town of crumbling Puritan gables and clustered gambrel roofs, he was very kindly received, and unearthed there a considerable amount of Curwen data. He found that his ancestor was born in Salem-Village, now Danvers, seven miles from town, on the eighteenth of February (O.S.) 1662-3; and that he had run away to sea at the age of fifteen, not appearing again for nine years, when he returned with the speech, dress, and manners of a native Englishman and settled in Salem proper. At that time he had little to do with his family, but spent most of his hours with the curious books he had brought from Europe, and the strange chemicals which came for him on ships from England, France, and Holland. Certain trips of his into the country were the objects of much local inquisitiveness, and were whisperingly associated with vague rumours of fires on the hills at night.      Curwens only close friends had been one Edward Hutchinson of Salem-Village and one Simon Orne of Salem. With these men he was often seen in conference about the Common, and visits among them were by no means infrequent. Hutchinson had a house well out toward the woods, and it was not altogether liked by sensitive people because of the sounds heard there at night. He was said to entertain strange visitors, and the lights seen from his windows were not always of the same colour. The knowledge he displayed concerning long-dead persons and long-forgotten events was considered distinctly unwholesome, and he disappeared about the time the witchcraft panic began, never to be heard from again. At that time Joseph Curwen also departed, but his settlement in Providence was soon learned of. Simon Orne lived in Salem until 1720, when his failure to grow visibly old began to excite attention. He thereafter disappeared, though thirty years later his precise counterpart and self-styled son turned up to claim his property. The claim was allowed on the strength of documents in Simon Ornes known hand, and Jedediah Orne continued to dwell in Salem till 1771, when certain letters from Providence citizens to the Rev. Thomas Barnard and others brought about his quiet removal to parts unknown.      Certain documents by and about all of these strange characters were available at the Essex Institute, the Court House, and the Registry of Deeds, and included both harmless commonplaces such as land titles and bills of sale, and furtive fragments of a more provocative nature. There were four or five unmistakable allusions to them on the witchcraft trial records; as when one Hepzibah Lawson swore on July 10, 1692, at the Court of Oyer and Terminer under Judge Hathorne, that fortie Witches and the Blacke Man were wont to meete in the Woodes behind Mr. Hutchinsons house, and one Amity How declared at a session of August 8th before Judge Gedney that Mr. G. B. (Rev. George Burroughs) on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B. Then there was a catalogue of Hutchinsons uncanny library as found after his disappearance, and an unfinished manuscript in his handwriting, couched in a cipher none could read. Ward had a photostatic copy of this manuscript made, and began to work casually on the cipher as soon as it was delivered to him. After the following August his labours on the cipher became intense and feverish, and there is reason to believe from his speech and conduct that he hit upon the key before October or November. He never stated, though, whether or not he had succeeded.      But of the greatest immediate interest was the Orne material. It took Ward only a short time to prove from identity of penmanship a thing he had already considered established from the text of the letter to Curwen; namely, that Simon Orne and his supposed son were one and the same person. As Orne had said to his correspondent, it was hardly safe to live too long in Salem, hence he resorted to a thirty-year sojourn abroad, and did not return to claim his lands except as a representative of a new generation. Orne had apparently been careful to destroy most of his correspondence, but the citizens who took action in 1771 found and preserved a few letters and papers which excited their wonder. There were cryptic formulae and diagrams in his and other hands which Ward now either copied with care or had photographed, and one extremely mysterious letter in a chirography that the searcher recognised from items in the Registry of Deeds as positively Joseph Curwens.      This Curwen letter, though undated as to the year, was evidently not the one in answer to which Orne had written the confiscated missive; and from internal evidence Ward placed it not much later than 1750. It may not be amiss to give the text in full, as a sample of the style of one whose history was so dark and terrible. The recipient is addressed as \"Simon\", but a line (whether drawn by Curwen or Orne Ward could not tell) is run through the word.Prouidence, I.

This letter, oddly enough, was what first gave Ward the exact location of Curwens Providence home; for none of the records encountered up to that time had been at all specific. The discovery was doubly striking because it indicated as the newer Curwen house built in 1761 on the site of the old, a dilapidated building still standing in Olney Court and well known to Ward in his antiquarian rambles over Stampers Hill. The place was indeed only a few squares from his own home on the great hills higher ground, and was now the abode of a negro family much esteemed for occasional washing, housecleaning, and furnace-tending services. To find, in distant Salem, such sudden proof of the significance of this familiar rookery in his own family history, was a highly impressive thing to Ward; and he resolved to explore the place immediately upon his return. The more mystical phases of the letter, which he took to be some extravagant kind of symbolism, frankly baffled him; though he noted with a thrill of curiosity that the Biblical passage referred to - Job 14, 14 - was the familiar verse, \"If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.\"2.      Young Ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement, and spent the following Saturday in a long and exhaustive study of the house in Olney Court. The place, now crumbling with age, had never been a mansion; but was a modest two-and-a-half story wooden town house of the familiar Providence colonial type, with plain peaked roof, large central chimney, and artistically carved doorway with rayed fanlight, triangular pediment, and trim Doric pilasters. It had suffered but little alteration externally, and Ward felt he was gazing on something very close to the sinister matters of his quest.      The present negro inhabitants were known to him, and he was very courteously shewn about the interior by old Asa and his stout wife Hannah. Here there was more change than the outside indicated, and Ward saw with regret that fully half of the fine scroll-and-urn overmantels and shell-carved cupboard linings were gone, whilst much of the fine wainscotting and bolection moulding was marked, hacked, and gouged, or covered up altogether with cheap wall-paper. In general, the survey did not yield as much as Ward had somehow expected; but it was at least exciting to stand within the ancestral walls which had housed such a man of horror as Joseph Curwen. He saw with a thrill that a monogram had been very carefully effaced from the ancient brass knocker.      From then until after the close of school Ward spent his time on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local Curwen data. The former still proved unyielding; but of the latter he obtained so much, and so many clues to similar data elsewhere, that he was ready by July to make a trip to New London and New York to consult old letters whose presence in those places was indicated. This trip was very fruitful, for it brought him the Fenner letters with their terrible description of the Pawtuxet farmhouse raid, and the Nightingale-Talbot letters in which he learned of the portrait painted on a panel of the Curwen library. This matter of the portrait interested him particularly, since he would have given much to know just what Joseph Curwen looked like; and he decided to make a second search of the house in Olney Court to see if there might not be some trace of the ancient features beneath peeling coats of later paint or layers of mouldy wall-paper.      Early in August that search took place, and Ward went carefully over the walls of every room sizeable enough to have been by any possibility the library of the evil builder. He paid especial attention to the large panels of such overmantels as still remained; and was keenly excited after about an hour, when on a broad area above the fireplace in a spacious ground-floor room he became certain that the surface brought out by the peeling of several coats of paint was sensibly darker than any ordinary interior paint or the wood beneath it was likely to have been. A few more careful tests with a thin knife, and he knew that he had come upon an oil portrait of great extent. With truly scholarly restraint the youth did not risk the damage which an immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture with the knife might have done, but just retired from the scene of his discovery to enlist expert help. In three days he returned with an artist of long experience, Mr. Walter C. Dwight, whose studio is near the foot of College Hill; and that accomplished restorer of paintings set to work at once with proper methods and chemical substances. Old Asa and his wife were duly excited over their strange visitors, and were properly reimbursed for this invasion of their domestic hearth.      As day by day the work of restoration progressed, Charles Ward looked on with growing interest at the lines and shades gradually unveiled after their long oblivion. Dwight had begun at the bottom; hence since the picture was a three-quarter-length one, the face did not come out for some time. It was meanwhile seen that the subject was a spare, well-shaped man with dark-blue coat, embroidered waistcoat, black satin small-clothes, and white silk stockings, seated in a carved chair against the background of a window with wharves and ships beyond. When the head came out it was observed to bear a neat Albemarle wig, and to possess a thin, calm, undistinguished face which seemed somehow familiar to both Ward and the artist. Only at the very last, though, did the restorer and his client begin to gasp with astonishment at the details of that lean, pallid visage, and to recognise with a touch of awe the dramatic trick which heredity had played. For it took the final bath of oil and the final stroke of the delicate scraper to bring out fully the expression which centuries had hidden; and to confront the bewildered Charles Dexter Ward, dweller in the past, with his own living features in the countenance of his horrible great-great-great-grandfather.      Ward brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered, and his father at once determined to purchase the picture despite its execution on stationary panelling. The resemblance to the boy, despite an appearance of rather greater age, was marvellous; and it could be seen that through some trick of atavism the physical contours of Joseph Curwen had found precise duplication after a century and a half. Mrs. Wards resemblance to her ancestor was not at all marked, though she could recall relatives who had some of the facial characteristics shared by her son and by the bygone Curwen. She did not relish the discovery, and told her husband that he had better burn the picture instead of bringing it home. There was, she averred, something unwholesome about it; not only intrinsically, but in its very resemblance to Charles. Mr. Ward, however, was a practical man of power and affairs - a cotton manufacturer with extensive mills at Riverpoint in the Pawtuxet Valley - and not one to listen to feminine scruples. The picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to his son, and he believed the boy deserved it as a present. In this opinion, it is needless to say, Charles most heartily concurred; and a few days later Mr. Ward located the owner of the house - a small rodent-featured person with a guttural accent - and obtained the whole mantel and overmantel bearing the picture at a curtly fixed priced which cut short the impending torrent of unctuous haggling.      It now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the Ward home, where provisions were made for its thorough restoration and installation with an electric mock-fireplace in Charless third-floor study or library. To Charles was left the task of superintending this removal, and on the twenty-eighth of August he accompanied two expert workmen from the Crooker decorating firm to the house in Olney Court, where the mantel and portrait-bearing overmantel were detached with great care and precision for transportation in the companys motor truck. There was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the chimneys course, and in this young Ward observed a cubical recess about a foot square, which must have lain directly behind the head of the portrait. Curious as to what such a space might mean or contain, the youth approached and looked within; finding beneath the deep coatings of dust and soot some loose yellowed papers, a crude, thick copybook, and a few mouldering textile shreds which may have formed the ribbon binding the rest together. Blowing away the bulk of the dirt and cinders, he took up the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover. It was in a hand which he had learned to recognise at the Essex Institute, and proclaimed the volume as the \"Journall and Notes of Jos: Curwen, Gent., of Providence-Plantations, Late of Salem.\"      Excited beyond measure by his discovery, Ward shewed the book to the two curious workmen beside him. Their testimony is absolute as to the nature and genuineness of the finding, and Dr. Willett relies on them to help establish his theory that the youth was not mad when he began his major eccentricities. All the other papers were likewise in Curwens handwriting, and one of them seemed especially portentous because of its inscription: \"To Him Who Shal Come After, & How He May Gett Beyonde Time & ye Spheres.\" Another was in a cipher; the same, Ward hoped, as the Hutchinson cipher which had hitherto baffled him. A third, and here the searcher rejoiced, seemed to be a key to the cipher; whilst the fourth and fifth were addressed respectively to \"Edw: Hutchinson, Armiger\" and \"Jedediah Orne, Esq.\", or Their Heir or Heirs, or Those Representg Them. The sixth and last was inscribed: \"Joseph Curwen his Life and Travells Betn ye yeares 1678 and 1687: Of Whither He Voyagd, Where He Stayd, Whom He Sawe, and What He Learnt.\"3.      We have now reached the point from which the more academic school of alienists date Charles Wards madness. Upon his discovery the youth had looked immediately at a few of the inner pages of the book and manuscripts, and had evidently seen something which impressed him tremendously. Indeed, in shewing the titles to the workmen he appeared to guard the text itself with peculiar care, and to labour under a perturbation for which even the antiquarian and genealogical significance of the find could hardly account. Upon returning home he broke the news with an almost embarrassed air, as if he wished to convey an idea of its supreme importance without having to exhibit the evidence itself. He did not even shew the titles to his parents, but simply told them that he had found some documents in Joseph Curwens handwriting, \"mostly in cipher\", which would have to be studied very carefully before yielding up their true meaning. It is unlikely that he would have shewn what he did to the workmen, had it not been for their unconcealed curiosity. As it was he doubtless wished to avoid any display of peculiar reticence which would increase their discussion of the matter.      That night Charles Ward sat up in his room reading the new-found book and papers, and when day came he did not desist. His meals, on his urgent request when his mother called to see what was amiss, were sent up to him; and in the afternoon he appeared only briefly when the men came to install the Curwen picture and mantelpiece in his study. The next night he slept in snatches in his clothes, meanwhile wrestling feverishly with the unravelling of the cipher manuscript. In the morning his mother saw that he was at work on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher, which he had frequently shewn her before; but in response to her query he said that the Curwen key could not be applied to it. That afternoon he abandoned his work and watched the men fascinatedly as they finished their installation of the picture with its woodwork above a cleverly realistic electric log, setting the mock-fireplace and overmantel a little out from the north wall as if a chimney existed, and boxing in the sides with panelling to match the rooms. The front panel holding the picture was sawn and hinged to allow cupboard space behind it. After the workmen went he moved his work into the study and sat down before it with his eyes half on the cipher and half on the portrait which stared back at him like a year-adding and century-recalling mirror.      His parents, subsequently recalling his conduct at this period, give interesting details anent the policy of concealment which he practiced. Before servants he seldom hid any paper which he might be studying, since he rightly assumed that Curwens intricate and archaic chirography would be too much for them. With his parents, however, he was more circumspect; and unless the manuscript in question were a cipher, or a mere mass of cryptic symbols and unknown ideographs (as that entitled \"To Him Who Shal Come After etc.\" seemed to be), he would cover it with some convenient paper until his caller had departed. At night he kept the papers under lock and key in an antique cabinet of his, where he also placed them whenever he left the room. He soon resumed fairly regular hours and habits, except that his long walks and other outside interests seemed to cease. The opening of school, where he now began his senior year, seemed a great bore to him; and he frequently asserted his determination never to bother with college. He had, he said, important special investigations to make, which would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and the humanities than any university which the world could boast.      Naturally, only one who had always been more or less studious, eccentric, and solitary could have pursued this course for many days without attracting notice. Ward, however, was constitutionally a scholar and a hermit; hence his parents were less surprised than regretful at the close confinement and secrecy he adopted. At the same time, both his father and mother thought it odd that he would shew them no scrap of his treasure-trove, nor give any connected account of such data as he had deciphered. This reticence he explained away as due to a wish to wait until he might announce some connected revelation, but as the weeks passed without further disclosures there began to grow up between the youth and his family a kind of constraint; intensified in his mothers case by her manifest disapproval of all Curwen delvings.      During October Ward began visiting the libraries again, but no longer for the antiquarian matter of his former days. Witchcraft and magic, occultism and daemonology, were what he sought now; and when Providence sources proved unfruitful he would take the train for Boston and tap the wealth of the great library in Copley Square, the Widener Library at Harvard, or the Zion Research Library in Brookline, where certain rare works on Biblical subjects are available. He bought extensively, and fitted up a whole additional set of shelves in his study for newly acquired works on uncanny subjects; while during the Christmas holidays he made a round of out-of-town trips including one to Salem to consult certain records at the Essex Institute.      About the middle of January, 1920, there entered Wards bearing an element of triumph which he did not explain, and he was no more found at work upon the Hutchinson cipher. Instead, he inaugurated a dual policy of chemical research and record-scanning; fitting up for the one a laboratory in the unused attic of the house, and for the latter haunting all the sources of vital statistics in Providence. Local dealers in drugs and scientific supplies, later questioned, gave astonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and instruments he purchased; but clerks at the State House, the City Hall, and the various libraries agree as to the definite object of his second interest. He was searching intensely and feverishly for the grave of Joseph Curwen, from whose slate slab an older generation had so wisely blotted the name.      Little by little there grew upon the Ward family the conviction that something was wrong. Charles had had freaks and changes of minor interests before, but this growing secrecy and absorption in strange pursuits was unlike even him. His school work was the merest pretence; and although he failed in no test, it could be seen that the old application had all vanished. He had other concernments now; and when not in his new laboratory with a score of obsolete alchemical books, could be found either poring over old burial records down town or glued to his volumes of occult lore in his study, where the startlingly - one almost fancied increasingly - similar features of Joseph Curwen stared blandly at him from the great overmantel on the north wall.      Late in March Ward added to his archive-searching a ghoulish series of rambles about the various ancient cemeteries of the city. The cause appeared later, when it was learned from City Hall clerks that he had probably found an important clue. His quest had suddenly shifted from the grave of Joseph Curwen to that of one Naphthali Field; and this shift was explained when, upon going over the files that he had been over, the investigators actually found a fragmentary record of Curwens burial which had escaped the general obliteration, and which stated that the curious leaden coffin had been interred \"10 ft. S. and 5 ft. W. of Naphthali Fields grave in ye - \". The lack of a specified burying-ground in the surviving entry greatly complicated the search, and Naphthali Fields grave seemed as elusive as that of Curwen; but here no systematic effacement had existed, and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on the stone itself even if its record had perished. Hence the rambles - from which St. Johns (the former Kings) Churchyard and the ancient Congregational burying-ground in the midst of Swan Point Cemetery were excluded, since other statistics had shewn that the only Naphthali Field (obiit 1729) whose grave could have been meant had been a Baptist.4.      It was toward May when Dr. Willett, at the request of the senior Ward, and fortified with all the Curwen data which the family had gleaned from Charles in his non-secretive days, talked with the young man. The interview was of little value or conclusiveness, for Willett felt at every moment that Charles was thoroughly master of himself and in touch with matters of real importance; but it at least forced the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanour. Of a pallid, impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment, Ward seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits, though not to reveal their object. He stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early scientific knowledge, for the most part in cipher, of an apparent scope comparable only to the discoveries of Friar Bacon and perhaps surpassing even those. They were, however, meaningless except when correlated with a body of learning now wholly obsolete; so that their immediate presentation to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all impressiveness and dramatic significance. To take their vivid place in the history of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of which they evolved, and to this task of correlation Ward was now devoting himself. He was seeking to acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of the Curwen data must possess, and hoped in time to make a full announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to the world of thought. Not even Einstein, he declared, could more profoundly revolutionise the current conception of things.      As to his graveyard search, whose object he freely admitted, but the details of whose progress he did not relate, he said he had reason to think that Joseph Curwens mutilated headstone bore certain mystic symbols - carved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by those who had effaced the name - which were absolutely essential to the final solution of his cryptic system. Curwen, he believed, had wished to guard his secret with care; and had consequently distributed the data in an exceedingly curious fashion. When Dr. Willett asked to see the mystic documents, Ward displayed much reluctance and tried to put him off with such things as photostatic copies of the Hutchinson cipher and Orne formulae and diagrams; but finally shewed him the exteriors of some of the real Curwen finds - the \"Journall and Notes\", the cipher (title in cipher also), and the formula-filled message \"To Him Who Shal Come After\" - and let him glance inside such as were in obscure characters.      He also opened the diary at a page carefully selected for its innocuousness and gave Willett a glimpse of Curwens connected handwriting in English. The doctor noted very closely the crabbed and complicated letters, and the general aura of the seventeenth century which clung round both penmanship and style despite the writers survival into the eighteenth century, and became quickly certain that the document was genuine. The text itself was relatively trivial, and Willett recalled only a fragment:\"Wedn. 16 Octr. 1754. My Sloope the Wakeful this Day putt in from London with XX newe Men pickd up in ye Indies, Spaniards from Martineco and 2 Dutch Men from Surinam.

Simon hath not Writ these V. Weekes, but I expecte soon hearg from him.\"      When upon reaching this point Dr. Willett turned the leaf he was quickly checked by Ward, who almost snatched the book from his grasp. All that the doctor had a chance to see on the newly opened page was a brief pair of sentences; but these, strangely enough, lingered tenaciously in his memory. They ran: \"Ye Verse from Liber-Damnatus beg spoke V Roodmasses and IV Hallows-Eves, I am Hopeful ye Thing is breedg Outside ye Spheres. It will drawe One who is to Come, if I can make sure he shal bee, and he shall think on Past thinges and look back thro all ye yeares, against ye which I must have ready ye Saltes or That to make em with.\"      Willett saw no more, but somehow this small glimpse gave a new and vague terror to the painted features of Joseph Curwen which stared blandly down from the overmantel. Ever after that he entertained the odd fancy - which his medical skill of course assured him was only a fancy - that the eyes of the portrait had a sort of wish, if not an actual tendency, to follow young Charles Ward as he moved about the room. He stopped before leaving to study the picture closely, marvelling at its resemblance to Charles and memorising every minute detail of the cryptical, colourless face, even down to a slight scar or pit in the smooth brow above the right eye. Cosmo Alexander, he decided, was a painter worthy of the Scotland that produced Raeburn, and a teacher worthy of his illustrious pupil Gilbert Stuart.      Assured by the doctor that Charless mental health was in no danger, but that on the other hand he was engaged in researches which might prove of real importance, the Wards were more lenient than they might otherwise have been when during the following June the youth made positive his refusal to attend college. He had, he declared, studies of much more vital importance to pursue; and intimated a wish to go abroad the following year in order to avail himself of certain sources of data not existing in America. The senior Ward, while denying this latter wish as absurd for a boy of only eighteen, acquiesced regarding the university; so that after a none too brilliant graduation from the Moses Brown School there ensued for Charles a three-year period of intensive occult study and graveyard searching. He became recognised as an eccentric, and dropped even more completely from the sight of his familys friends than he had been before; keeping close to his work and only occasionally making trips to other cities to consult obscure records. Once he went south to talk with a strange old mulatto who dwelt in a swamp and about whom a newspaper had printed a curious article. Again he sought a small village in the Adirondacks whence reports of certain odd ceremonial practices had come. But still his parents forbade him the trip to the Old World which he desired.      Coming of age in April, 1923, and having previously inherited a small competence from his maternal grandfather, Ward determined at last to take the European trip hitherto denied him. Of his proposed itinerary he would say nothing save that the needs of his studies would carry him to many places, but he promised to write his parents fully and faithfully. When they saw he could not be dissuaded, they ceased all opposition and helped as best they could; so that in June the young man sailed for Liverpool with the farewell blessings of his father and mother, who accompanied him to Boston and waved him out of sight from the White Star pier in Charlestown. Letters soon told of his safe arrival, and of his securing good quarters in Great Russell Street, London; where he proposed to stay, shunning all family friends, till he had exhausted the resources of the British Museum in a certain direction. Of his daily life he wrote but little, for there was little to write. Study and experiment consumed all his time, and he mentioned a laboratory which he had established in one of his rooms. That he said nothing of antiquarian rambles in the glamorous old city with its luring skyline of ancient domes and steeples and its tangles of roads and alleys whose mystic convolutions and sudden vistas alternately beckon and surprise, was taken by his parents as a good index of the degree to which his new interests had engrossed his mind.      In June, 1924, a brief note told of his departure for Paris, to which he had before made one or two flying trips for material in the Bibliothque Nationale. For three months thereafter he sent only postal cards, giving an address in the Rue St. Jacques and referring to a special search among rare manuscripts in the library of an unnamed private collector. He avoided acquaintances, and no tourists brought back reports of having seen him. Then came a silence, and in October the Wards received a picture card from Prague, Czecho-Slovakia, stating that Charles was in that ancient town for the purpose of conferring with a certain very aged man supposed to be the last living possessor of some very curious mediaeval information. He gave an address in the Neustadt, and announced no move till the following January; when he dropped several cards from Vienna telling of his passage through that city on the way toward a more easterly region whither one of his correspondents and fellow-delvers into the occult had invited him.      The next card was from Klausenburg in Transylvania, and told of Wards progress toward his destination. He was going to visit a Baron Ferenczy, whose estate lay in the mountains east of Rakus; and was to be addressed at Rakus in the care of that nobleman. Another card from Rakus a week later, saying that his hosts carriage had met him and that he was leaving the village for the mountains, was his last message for a considerable time; indeed, he did not reply to his parents frequent letters until May, when he wrote to discourage the plan of his mother for a meeting in London, Paris, or Rome during the summer, when the elder Wards were planning to travel in Europe. His researches, he said, were such that he could not leave his present quarters; while the situation of Baron Ferenczys castle did not favour visits. It was on a crag in the dark wooded mountains, and the region was so shunned by the country folk that normal people could not help feeling ill at ease. Moreover, the Baron was not a person likely to appeal to correct and conservative New England gentlefolk. His aspect and manners had idiosyncrasies, and his age was so great as to be disquieting. It would be better, Charles said, if his parents would wait for his return to Providence; which could scarcely be far distant.      That return did not, however, take place until May, 1926, when after a few heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into New York on the Homeric and traversed the long miles to Providence by motor-coach, eagerly drinking in the green rolling hills, the fragrant, blossoming orchards, and the white steepled towns of vernal Connecticut; his first taste of ancient New England in nearly four years. When the coach crossed the Pawcatuck and entered Rhode Island amidst the faery goldenness of a late spring afternoon his heart beat with quickened force, and the entry to Providence along Reservoir and Elmwood avenues was a breathless and wonderful thing despite the depths of forbidden lore to which he had delved. At the high square where Broad, Weybosset, and Empire Streets join, he saw before and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant, remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town; and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down the terminal behind the Biltmore, bringing into view the great dome and soft, roof-pierced greenery of the ancient hill across the river, and the tall colonial spire of the First Baptist Church limned pink in the magic evening light against the fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous background.      Old Providence! It was this place and the mysterious forces of its long, continuous history which had brought him into being, and which had drawn him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no prophet might fix. Here lay the arcana, wondrous or dreadful as the case might be, for which all his years of travel and application had been preparing him. A taxicab whirled him through Post Office Square with its glimpse of the river, the old Market House, and the head of the bay, and up the steep curved slope of Waterman Street to Prospect, where the vast gleaming dome and sunset-flushed Ionic columns of the Christian Science Church beckoned northward. Then eight squares past the fine old estates his childish eyes had known, and the quaint brick sidewalks so often trodden by his youthful feet. And at last the little white overtaken farmhouse on the right, on the left the classic Adam porch and stately bayed facade of the great brick house where he was born. It was twilight, and Charles Dexter Ward had come home.5.      A school of alienists slightly less academic than Dr. Lymans assign to Wards European trip the beginning of his true madness. Admitting that he was sane when he started, they believe that his conduct upon returning implies a disastrous change. But even to this claim Dr. Willett refuses to accede. There was, he insists, something later; and the queernesses of the youth at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroad - odd enough things, to be sure, but by no means implying mental aberration on the part of their celebrant. Ward himself, though visibly aged and hardened, was still normal in his general reactions; and in several talks with Willett displayed a balance which no madman - even an incipient one - could feign continuously for long. What elicited the notion of insanity at this period were the sounds heard at all hours from Wards attic laboratory, in which he kept himself most of the time. There were chantings and repetitions, and thunderous declamations in uncanny rhythms; and although these sounds were always in Wards own voice, there was something in the quality of that voice, and in the accents of the formulae it pronounced, which could not but chill the blood of every hearer. It was noticed that Nig, the venerable and beloved black cat of the household, bristled and arched his back perceptibly when certain of the tones were heard.      The odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise exceedingly strange. Sometimes they were very noxious, but more often they were aromatic, with a haunting, elusive quality which seemed to have the power of inducing fantastic images. People who smelled them had a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas, with strange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite distance. Ward did not resume his old-time rambles, but applied himself diligently to the strange books he had brought home, and to equally strange delvings within his quarters; explaining that European sources had greatly enlarged the possibilities of his work, and promising great revelations in the years to come. His older aspect increased to a startling degree his resemblance to the Curwen portrait in his library; and Dr. Willett would often pause by the latter after a call, marvelling at the virtual identity, and reflecting that only the small pit above the pictures right eye now remained to differentiate the long-dead wizard from the living youth. These calls of Willetts, undertaken at the request of the senior Wards, were curious affairs. Ward at no time repulsed the doctor, but the latter saw that he could never reach the young mans inner psychology. Frequently he noted peculiar things about; little wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables, and the half-erased remnants of circles, triangles, and pentagrams in chalk or charcoal on the cleared central space of the large room. And always in the night those rhythms and incantations thundered, till it became very difficult to keep servants or suppress furtive talk of Charless madness.      In January, 1927, a peculiar incident occurred. One night about midnight, as Charles was chanting a ritual whose weird cadence echoed unpleasantly through the house below, there came a sudden gust of chill wind from the bay, and a faint, obscure trembling of the earth which everyone in the neighbourhood noted. At the same time the cat exhibited phenomenal traces of fright, while dogs bayed for as much as a mile around. This was the prelude to a sharp thunderstorm, anomalous for the season, which brought with it such a crash that Mr. and Mrs. Ward believed the house had been struck. They rushed upstairs to see what damage had been done, but Charles met them at the door to the attic; pale, resolute, and portentous, with an almost fearsome combination of triumph and seriousness on his face. He assured them that the house had not really been struck, and that the storm would soon be over. They paused, and looking through a window saw that he was indeed right; for the lightning flashed farther and farther off, whilst the trees ceased to bend in the strange frigid gust from the water. The thunder sank to a sort of dull mumbling chuckle and finally died away. Stars came out, and the stamp of triumph on Charles Wards face crystallised into a very singular expression.      For two months or more after this incident Ward was less confined than usual to his laboratory. He exhibited a curious interest in the weather, and made odd inquiries about the date of the spring thawing of the ground. One night late in March he left the house after midnight, and did not return till almost morning; when his mother, being wakeful, heard a rumbling motor draw up to the carriage entrance. Muffled oaths could be distinguished, and Mrs. Ward, rising and going to the window, saw four dark figures removing a long, heavy box from a truck at Charless direction and carrying it within by the side door. She heard laboured breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs, and finally a dull thumping in the attic; after which the footfalls descended again, and the four men reappeared outside and drove off in their truck.      The next day Charles resumed his strict attic seclusion, drawing down the dark shades of his laboratory windows and appearing to be working on some metal substance. He would open the door to no one, and steadfastly refused all proffered food. About noon a wrenching sound followed by a terrible cry and a fall were heard, but when Mrs. Ward rapped at the door her son at length answered faintly, and told her that nothing had gone amiss. The hideous and indescribable stench now welling out was absolutely harmless and unfortunately necessary. Solitude was the one prime essential, and he would appear later for dinner. That afternoon, after the conclusion of some odd hissing sounds which came from behind the locked portal, he did finally appear; wearing an extremely haggard aspect and forbidding anyone to enter the laboratory upon any pretext. This, indeed, proved the beginning of a new policy of secrecy; for never afterward was any other person permitted to visit either the mysterious garret workroom or the adjacent storeroom which he cleaned out, furnished roughly, and added to his inviolably private domain as a sleeping apartment. Here he lived, with books brought up from his library beneath, till the time he purchased the Pawtuxet bungalow and moved to it all his scientific effects.      In the evening Charles secured the paper before the rest of the family and damaged part of it through an apparent accident. Later on Dr. Willett, having fixed the date from statements by various members of the household, looked up an intact copy at the Journal office and found that in the destroyed section the following small item had occurred:Nocturnal Diggers Surprised inNorth Burial GroundRobert Hart, night watchman at the North Burial Ground, this morning discovered a party of several men with a motor truck in the oldest part of the cemetery, but apparently frightened them off before they had accomplished whatever their object may have been.      The discovery took place at about four oclock, when Harts attention was attracted by the sound of a motor outside his shelter. Investigating, he saw a large truck on the main drive several rods away; but could not reach it before the sound of his feet on the gravel had revealed his approach. The men hastily placed a large box in the truck and drove away toward the street before they could be overtaken; and since no known grave was disturbed, Hart believes that this box was an object which they wished to bury.      The diggers must have been at work for a long while before detection, for Hart found an enormous hole dug at a considerable distance back from the roadway in the lot of Amasa Field, where most of the old stones have long ago disappeared. The hole, a place as large and deep as a grave, was empty; and did not coincide with any interment mentioned in the cemetery records.      Sergt. Riley of the Second Station viewed the spot and gave the opinion that the hole was dug by bootleggers rather gruesomely and ingeniously seeking a safe cache for liquor in a place not likely to be disturbed. In reply to questions Hart said he thought the escaping truck had headed up Rochambeau Avenue, though he could not be sure.      During the next few days Ward was seldom seen by his family. Having added sleeping quarters to his attic realm, he kept closely to himself there, ordering food brought to the door and not taking it in until after the servant had gone away. The droning of monotonous formulae and the chanting of bizarre rhythms recurred at intervals, while at other times occasional listeners could detect the sound of tinkling glass, hissing chemicals, running water, or roaring gas flames. Odours of the most unplaceable quality, wholly unlike any before noted, hung at times around the door; and the air of tension observable in the young recluse whenever he did venture briefly forth was such as to excite the keenest speculation. Once he made a hasty trip to the Athenaeum for a book he required, and again he hired a messenger to fetch him a highly obscure volume from Boston. Suspense was written portentously over the whole situation, and both the family and Dr. Willett confessed themselves wholly at a loss what to do or think about it.6.      Then on the fifteenth of April a strange development occurred. While nothing appeared to grow different in kind, there was certainly a very terrible difference in degree; and Dr. Willett somehow attaches great significance to the change. The day was Good Friday, a circumstance of which the servants made much, but which others quite naturally dismiss as an irrelevant coincidence. Late in the afternoon young Ward began repeating a certain formula in a singularly loud voice, at the same time burning some substance so pungent that its fumes escaped over the entire house. The formula was so plainly audible in the hall outside the locked door that Mrs. Ward could not help memorising it as she waited and listened anxiously, and later on she was able to write it down at Dr. Willetts request. It ran as follows, and experts have told Dr. Willett that its very close analogue can be found in the mystic writings of \"Eliphas Levi\", that cryptic soul who crept through a crack in the forbidden door and glimpsed the frightful vistas of the void beyond:\"Per Adonai Eloim, Adonai Jehova,Adonai Sabaoth, Metraton On Agla Mathon,verbum pythonicum, mysterium salamandrae,conventus sylvorum, antra gnomorum,daemonia Coeli Gad, Almousin, Gibor, Jehosua,Evam, Zariatnatmik, veni, veni, veni.\"      This had been going on for two hours without change or intermission when over all the neighbourhood a pandaemoniac howling of dogs set in. The extent of this howling can be judged from the space it received in the papers the next day, but to those in the Ward household it was overshadowed by the odour which instantly followed it; a hideous, all-pervasive odour which none of them had ever smelt before or have ever smelt since. In the midst of this mephitic flood there came a very perceptible flash like that of lightning, which would have been blinding and impressive but for the daylight around; and then was heard the voice that no listener can ever forget because of its thunderous remoteness, its incredible depth, and its eldritch dissimilarity to Charles Wards voice. It shook the house, and was clearly heard by at least two neighbours above the howling of the dogs. Mrs. Ward, who had been listening in despair outside her sons locked laboratory, shivered as she recognised its hellish import; for Charles had told her of its evil fame in dark books, and of the manner in which it had thundered, according to the Fenner letters, above the doomed Pawtuxet farmhouse on the night of Joseph Curwens annihilation. There was no mistaking that nightmare phrase, for Charles had described it too vividly in the old days when he had talked frankly of his Curwen investigations. And yet it was only this fragment of an archaic and forgotten language: \"DIES MIES JESCHET BOENE DOESEF DOUVEMA ENITEMAUS\".      Close upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening of the daylight, though sunset was still an hour distant, and then a puff of added odour different from the first but equally unknown and intolerable. Charles was chanting again now and his mother could hear syllables that sounded like \"Yi-nash-Yog-Sothoth-he-lgeb-fi-throdog\" - ending in a \"Yah!\" whose maniacal force mounted in an ear-splitting crescendo. A second later all previous memories were effaced by the wailing scream which burst out with frantic explosiveness and gradually changed form to a paroxysm of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Mrs. Ward, with the mingled fear and blind courage of maternity, advanced and knocked affrightedly at the concealing panels, but obtained no sign of recognition. She knocked again, but paused nervelessly as a second shriek arose, this one unmistakably in the familiar voice of her son, and sounding concurrently with the still bursting cachinnations of that other voice. Presently she fainted, although she is still unable to recall the precise and immediate cause. Memory sometimes makes merciful deletions.      Mr. Ward returned from the business section at about quarter past six; and not finding his wife downstairs, was told by the frightened servants that she was probably watching at Charless door, from which the sounds had been far stranger than ever before. Mounting the stairs at once, he saw Mrs. Ward stretched at full length on the floor of the corridor outside the laboratory; and realising that she had fainted, hastened to fetch a glass of water from a set bowl in a neighbouring alcove. Dashing the cold fluid in her face, he was heartened to observe an immediate response on her part, and was watching the bewildered opening of her eyes when a chill shot through him and threatened to reduce him to the very state from which she was emerging. For the seemingly silent laboratory was not as silent as it had appeared to be, but held the murmurs of a tense, muffled conversation in tones too low for comprehension, yet of a quality profoundly disturbing to the soul.      It was not, of course, new for Charles to mutter formulae; but this muttering was definitely different. It was so palpably a dialogue, or imitation of a dialogue, with the regular alteration of inflections suggesting question and answer, statement and response. One voice was undisguisedly that of Charles, but the other had a depth and hollowness which the youths best powers of ceremonial mimicry had scarcely approached before. There was something hideous, blasphemous, and abnormal about it, and but for a cry from his recovering wife which cleared his mind by arousing his protective instincts it is not likely that Theodore Howland Ward could have maintained for nearly a year more his old boast that he had never fainted. As it was, he seized his wife in his arms and bore her quickly downstairs before she could notice the voices which had so horribly disturbed him. Even so, however, he was not quick enough to escape catching something himself which caused him to stagger dangerously with his burden. For Mrs. Wards cry had evidently been heard by others than he, and there had come from behind the locked door the first distinguishable words which that masked and terrible colloquy had yielded. They were merely an excited caution in Charless own voice, but somehow their implications held a nameless fright for the father who overheard them. The phrase was just this: \"Sshh! - write!\"      Mr. and Mrs. Ward conferred at some length after dinner, and the former resolved to have a firm and serious talk with Charles that very night. No matter how important the object, such conduct could no longer be permitted; for these latest developments transcended every limit of sanity and formed a menace to the order and nervous well-being of the entire household. The youth must indeed have taken complete leave of his senses, since only downright madness could have prompted the wild screams and imaginary conversations in assumed voices which the present day had brought forth. All this must be stopped, or Mrs. Ward would be made ill and the keeping of servants become an impossibility.      Mr. Ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for Charless laboratory. On the third floor, however, he paused at the sounds which he heard proceeding from the now disused library of his son. Books were apparently being flung about and papers wildly rustled, and upon stepping to the door Mr. Ward beheld the youth within, excitedly assembling a vast armful of literary matter of every size and shape. Charless aspect was very drawn and haggard, and he dropped his entire load with a start at the sound of his fathers voice. At the elder mans command he sat down, and for some time listened to the admonitions he had so long deserved. There was no scene. At the end of the lecture he agreed that his father was right, and that his noises, mutterings, incantations, and chemical odours were indeed inexcusable nuisances. He agreed to a policy of greater quiet, though insisting on a prolongation of his extreme privacy. Much of his future work, he said, was in any case purely book research; and he could obtain quarters elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be necessary at a later stage. For the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed the keenest contrition, and explained that the conversation later heard was part of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental atmosphere. His use of abstruse technical terms somewhat bewildered Mr. Ward, but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and poise despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity. The interview was really quite inconclusive, and as Charles picked up his armful and left the room Mr. Ward hardly knew what to make of the entire business. It was as mysterious as the death of poor old Nig, whose stiffening form had been found an hour before in the basement, with staring eyes and fear-distorted mouth.      Driven by some vague detective instinct, the bewildered parent now glanced curiously at the vacant shelves to see what his son had taken up to the attic. The youths library was plainly and rigidly classified, so that one might tell at a glance the books or at least the kind of books which had been withdrawn. On this occasion Mr. Ward was astonished to find that nothing of the occult or the antiquarian, beyond what had been previously removed, was missing. These new withdrawals were all modern items; histories, scientific treatises, geographies, manuals of literature, philosophic works, and certain contemporary newspapers and magazines. It was a very curious shift from Charles Wards recent run of reading, and the father paused in a growing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense of strangeness. The strangeness was a very poignant sensation, and almost clawed at his chest as he strove to see just what was wrong around him. Something was indeed wrong, and tangibly as well as spiritually so. Ever since he had been in this room he had known that something was amiss, and at last it dawned upon him what it was.      On the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the house in Olney Court, but to the cracked and precariously restored oils of the large Curwen portrait disaster had come. Time and unequal heating had done their work at last, and at some time since the rooms last cleaning the worst had happened. Peeling clear of the wood, curling tighter and tighter, and finally crumbling into small bits with what must have been malignly silent suddenness, the portrait of Joseph Curwen had resigned forever its staring surveillance of the youth it so strangely resembled, and now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust.", "X.In the end the three men from Arkham—old, white-bearded Dr. Armitage, stocky, iron-grey Professor Rice, and lean, youngish Dr. Morgan—ascended the mountain alone. After much patient instruction regarding its focussing and use, they left the telescope with the frightened group that remained in the road; and as they climbed they were watched closely by those among whom the glass was passed around. It was hard going, and Armitage had to be helped more than once. High above the toiling group the great swath trembled as its hellish maker re-passed with snail-like deliberateness. Then it was obvious that the pursuers were gaining.      Curtis Whateley—of the undecayed branch—was holding the telescope when the Arkham party detoured radically from the swath. He told the crowd that the men were evidently trying to get to a subordinate peak which overlooked the swath at a point considerably ahead of where the shrubbery was now bending. This, indeed, proved to be true; and the party were seen to gain the minor elevation only a short time after the invisible blasphemy had passed it.      Then Wesley Corey, who had taken the glass, cried out that Armitage was adjusting the sprayer which Rice held, and that something must be about to happen. The crowd stirred uneasily, recalling that this sprayer was expected to give the unseen horror a moment of visibility. Two or three men shut their eyes, but Curtis Whateley snatched back the telescope and strained his vision to the utmost. He saw that Rice, from the party’s point of vantage above and behind the entity, had an excellent chance of spreading the potent powder with marvellous effect.      Those without the telescope saw only an instant’s flash of grey cloud—a cloud about the size of a moderately large building—near the top of the mountain. Curtis, who had held the instrument, dropped it with a piercing shriek into the ankle-deep mud of the road. He reeled, and would have crumpled to the ground had not two or three others seized and steadied him. All he could do was moan half-inaudibly,      “Oh, oh, great Gawd . . . that . . . that . . .”      There was a pandemonium of questioning, and only Henry Wheeler thought to rescue the fallen telescope and wipe it clean of mud. Curtis was past all coherence, and even isolated replies were almost too much for him.      “Bigger’n a barn . . . all made o’ squirmin’ ropes . . . hull thing sort o’ shaped like a hen’s egg bigger’n anything, with dozens o’ legs like hogsheads that haff shut up when they step . . . nothin’ solid abaout it—all like jelly, an’ made o’ sep’rit wrigglin’ ropes pushed clost together . . . great bulgin’ eyes all over it . . . ten or twenty maouths or trunks a-stickin’ aout all along the sides, big as stovepipes, an’ all a-tossin’ an’ openin’ an’ shuttin’ . . . all grey, with kinder blue or purple rings . . . an’ Gawd in heaven—that haff face on top! . . .”      This final memory, whatever it was, proved too much for poor Curtis; and he collapsed completely before he could say more. Fred Farr and Will Hutchins carried him to the roadside and laid him on the damp grass. Henry Wheeler, trembling, turned the rescued telescope on the mountain to see what he might. Through the lenses were discernible three tiny figures, apparently running toward the summit as fast as the steep incline allowed. Only these—nothing more. Then everyone noticed a strangely unseasonable noise in the deep valley behind, and even in the underbrush of Sentinel Hill itself. It was the piping of unnumbered whippoorwills, and in their shrill chorus there seemed to lurk a note of tense and evil expectancy.      Earl Sawyer now took the telescope and reported the three figures as standing on the topmost ridge, virtually level with the altar-stone but at a considerable distance from it. One figure, he said, seemed to be raising its hands above its head at rhythmic intervals; and as Sawyer mentioned the circumstance the crowd seemed to hear a faint, half-musical sound from the distance, as if a loud chant were accompanying the gestures. The weird silhouette on that remote peak must have been a spectacle of infinite grotesqueness and impressiveness, but no observer was in a mood for aesthetic appreciation. “I guess he’s sayin’ the spell,” whispered Wheeler as he snatched back the telescope. The whippoorwills were piping wildly, and in a singularly curious irregular rhythm quite unlike that of the visible ritual.      Suddenly the sunshine seemed to lessen without the intervention of any discernible cloud. It was a very peculiar phenomenon, and was plainly marked by all. A rumbling sound seemed brewing beneath the hills, mixed strangely with a concordant rumbling which clearly came from the sky. Lightning flashed aloft, and the wondering crowd looked in vain for the portents of storm. The chanting of the men from Arkham now became unmistakable, and Wheeler saw through the glass that they were all raising their arms in the rhythmic incantation. From some farmhouse far away came the frantic barking of dogs.      The change in the quality of the daylight increased, and the crowd gazed about the horizon in wonder. A purplish darkness, born of nothing more than a spectral deepening of the sky’s blue, pressed down upon the rumbling hills. Then the lightning flashed again, somewhat brighter than before, and the crowd fancied that it had shewed a certain mistiness around the altar-stone on the distant height. No one, however, had been using the telescope at that instant. The whippoorwills continued their irregular pulsation, and the men of Dunwich braced themselves tensely against some imponderable menace with which the atmosphere seemed surcharged.      Without warning came those deep, cracked, raucous vocal sounds which will never leave the memory of the stricken group who heard them. Not from any human throat were they born, for the organs of man can yield no such acoustic perversions. Rather would one have said they came from the pit itself, had not their source been so unmistakably the altar-stone on the peak. It is almost erroneous to call them sounds at all, since so much of their ghastly, infra-bass timbre spoke to dim seats of consciousness and terror far subtler than the ear; yet one must do so, since their form was indisputably though vaguely that of half-articulate words. They were loud—loud as the rumblings and the thunder above which they echoed—yet did they come from no visible being. And because imagination might suggest a conjectural source in the world of non-visible beings, the huddled crowd at the mountain’s base huddled still closer, and winced as if in expectation of a blow.      “Ygnaiih . . . ygnaiih . . . thflthkh’ngha . . . Yog-Sothoth . . .” rang the hideous croaking out of space. “Y’bthnk . . . h’ehye—n’grkdl’lh. . . .”      The speaking impulse seemed to falter here, as if some frightful psychic struggle were going on. Henry Wheeler strained his eye at the telescope, but saw only the three grotesquely silhouetted human figures on the peak, all moving their arms furiously in strange gestures as their incantation drew near its culmination. From what black wells of Acherontic fear or feeling, from what unplumbed gulfs of extra-cosmic consciousness or obscure, long-latent heredity, were those half-articulate thunder-croakings drawn? Presently they began to gather renewed force and coherence as they grew in stark, utter, ultimate frenzy.      “Eh-ya-ya-ya-yahaah—e’yayayayaaaa . . . ngh’aaaaa . . . ngh’aaaa . . . h’yuh . . . h’yuh . . . HELP! HELP! . . . ff—ff—ff—FATHER! FATHER! YOG-SOTHOTH! . . .”      But that was all. The pallid group in the road, still reeling at the indisputably English syllables that had poured thickly and thunderously down from the frantic vacancy beside that shocking altar-stone, were never to hear such syllables again. Instead, they jumped violently at the terrific report which seemed to rend the hills; the deafening, cataclysmic peal whose source, be it inner earth or sky, no hearer was ever able to place. A single lightning-bolt shot from the purple zenith to the altar-stone, and a great tidal wave of viewless force and indescribable stench swept down from the hill to all the countryside. Trees, grass, and underbrush were whipped into a fury; and the frightened crowd at the mountain’s base, weakened by the lethal foetor that seemed about to asphyxiate them, were almost hurled off their feet. Dogs howled from the distance, green grass and foliage wilted to a curious, sickly yellow-grey, and over field and forest were scattered the bodies of dead whippoorwills.      The stench left quickly, but the vegetation never came right again. To this day there is something queer and unholy about the growths on and around that fearsome hill. Curtis Whateley was only just regaining consciousness when the Arkham men came slowly down the mountain in the beams of a sunlight once more brilliant and untainted. They were grave and quiet, and seemed shaken by memories and reflections even more terrible than those which had reduced the group of natives to a state of cowed quivering. In reply to a jumble of questions they only shook their heads and reaffirmed one vital fact.      “The thing has gone forever,” Armitage said. “It has been split up into what it was originally made of, and can never exist again. It was an impossibility in a normal world. Only the least fraction was really matter in any sense we know. It was like its father—and most of it has gone back to him in some vague realm or dimension outside our material universe; some vague abyss out of which only the most accursed rites of human blasphemy could ever have called him for a moment on the hills.”      There was a brief silence, and in that pause the scattered senses of poor Curtis Whateley began to knit back into a sort of continuity; so that he put his hands to his head with a moan. Memory seemed to pick itself up where it had left off, and the horror of the sight that had prostrated him burst in upon him again.      “Oh, oh, my Gawd, that haff face—that haff face on top of it . . . that face with the red eyes an’ crinkly albino hair, an’ no chin, like the Whateleys . . . It was a octopus, centipede, spider kind o’ thing, but they was a haff-shaped man’s face on top of it, an’ it looked like Wizard Whateley’s, only it was yards an’ yards acrost. . . .”      He paused exhausted, as the whole group of natives stared in a bewilderment not quite crystallised into fresh terror. Only old Zebulon Whateley, who wanderingly remembered ancient things but who had been silent heretofore, spoke aloud.      “Fifteen year’ gone,” he rambled, “I heerd Ol’ Whateley say as haow some day we’d hear a child o’ Lavinny’s a-callin’ its father’s name on the top o’ Sentinel Hill. . . .”      But Joe Osborn interrupted him to question the Arkham men anew.      “What was it anyhaow, an’ haowever did young Wizard Whateley call it aout o’ the air it come from?”      Armitage chose his words very carefully.      “It was—well, it was mostly a kind of force that doesn’t belong in our part of space; a kind of force that acts and grows and shapes itself by other laws than those of our sort of Nature. We have no business calling in such things from outside, and only very wicked people and very wicked cults ever try to. There was some of it in Wilbur Whateley himself—enough to make a devil and a precocious monster of him, and to make his passing out a pretty terrible sight. I’m going to burn his accursed diary, and if you men are wise you’ll dynamite that altar-stone up there, and pull down all the rings of standing stones on the other hills. Things like that brought down the beings those Whateleys were so fond of—the beings they were going to let in tangibly to wipe out the human race and drag the earth off to some nameless place for some nameless purpose.      “But as to this thing we’ve just sent back—the Whateleys raised it for a terrible part in the doings that were to come. It grew fast and big from the same reason that Wilbur grew fast and big—but it beat him because it had a greater share of the outsideness in it. You needn’t ask how Wilbur called it out of the air. He didn’t call it out. It was his twin brother, but it looked more like the father than he did.”"]}
{"id": "EN009", "pair": ["Northernmost Quang Binh Province, Socialist Republic of VietnamJuly 2, 2011Two young adults walked up the path beside the bronze-casters shop to the barren hillside and the forest edge beyond. \"So, how do you like things so far?\" Marie asked as she and Joseph made their way up the rough-hewn stone steps. Their destination was the house of the village woodcutter and charcoal-burner, a place that also doubled as a furniture workshop and, importantly for this journey, the villages firearms armory.\"Not that bad. Ive been doing domestic work for the past few days but neither Noc nor his wife seems to really be a slave driver. Actually, they feel more like people who understand that theyre training a new servant.\" Joseph thought on something. \"Im actually surprised that he and the other hunters allowing me to accompany them. They neither seem to respect me or anyone who would stoop to use a gun, so I wonder why they changed their attitude.\"It was here that Marie began ruminating on something, an old thought that had given her more than her share of bad dreams. \"There are some things worth surrendering pride for, Joseph. Tell me, have you seen those weird scars on the ankles and arms of Nocs wife?\"\"You mean those marks that look like Giant Squid wounds? Yes, but what about them?\" Joseph suddenly stopped. \"What are they, anyway?\"Having stopped also, Marie sighed, a sense of foreboding covering her features. \"When I asked that myself, they didnt tell me much more than the stories Id already heard when I was a kid: legends about ghosts, devils from the mist, shadows that drink blood is what they called them sometimes. But what I got here is that those Shugoran priests that saved my people werent just going to somewhere. They were running ifrom/i somewhere, someone or something, something that no one is willing to talk any further about.\" Marie started forward again at such a pace that her boyfriend had to hurry to catch up.Getting the feeling that nothing more was going to be answered on that subject for a good while, Joseph changed track. \"How are the others getting on? Ive been stuck in the house most of the day and I havent really had a chance to talk to either the Prof or my classmates.\"Happy to shift from thoughts of chilling horror, Marie chuckled with increasing mirth as she began going back up the trail. \"From what Ive heard, Alberts been filming every step in the bronze making process that he can, not to mention all the casting processes and various uses of equipment. The only reason that he hasnt been thrown out yet is because the familys elder patriarch has taken a liking to… well, not just him, but all of you guys, just from the descriptions alone. Your Professor and his assistant have basically locked themselves in the temple: no word out yet, but I assume that theyre observing normal operations. As for Tracy…\" Here, Marie began acting a little odd. \"She talks in her sleep, if you didnt know.\"\"Really?\" Joseph responded interestedly. Not reacting the way that she had feared, Marie relaxed a little from the paranoia she had been wrangling with.\"Yeah, and the strange thing is that its in… well, tree-ish. And then theres the tattooing on her back as well.\" Marie went on talking, relieved that her fear seemed to have been senseless.Before he could answer his girlfriends increasingly chatty descriptions, a thought crossed Josephs mind on exactly why such a thing might be mentioned. \"Why would you ask me if I knew…\" Then the realization hit him and he stopped cold. \"Were you thinking that… Tracy and I?\"Marie stopped as well. \"Its not unknown to happen, you know.\" Marie answered the implied question almost defensively, as if trying to justify her momentary paranoia. \"Sweethearts get separated and sometimes… one finds companionship elsewhere. Especially with, you know.\" Marie tapped the side of her head, indicating the \"visitors\" that had first cursed Joseph Claytons existence during High School.Joseph snorted in an amused, disparaging way. \"Please dont give them that much credit. Ive ignored, rebuked and insulted those jerks so many times that Ive made a virtual bloodsport out of it. Besides, if Id made any moves towards Tracy, Albert would have killed me.\"\"Wait, those two… theyre together?\" Marie asked, wondering how shed missed that.\"Intimately so, yes.\" This was all Joseph was willing to say, himself not wishing to examine too closely the memory of walking in on his dorm-mate and his girl when they had neglected to put a sock on the doorknob. \"Anyway, as to these voices, I went to the psychology department to see if I could discover just what was causing it.\"Marie waited a heartbeat before plunging into the vital question. \"And what did they say?\" If her boyfriend did indeed have Schizophrenia, then he needed help: drugs to control the symptoms and perhaps therapy to help him conquer whatever dark corners of his psyche were feeding these voices.If it was something else… then perhaps the local sorcerers might need to be consulted before long.Joseph sighed. Whatever is going on inside my head, the geeks with the scanning equipment are pretty sure that this isnt a case of medical Schizophrenia. They say that the symptoms are all wrong, the voices arent persuasive enough… and that I dont have any of the telltale injuries on the brain that would suggest medical reasons. And then there was the time they hooked me up to the EEG during one of my episodes.\" He paused, wondering just how to proceed but, since he was already experiencing strange things, he decided just to press on. \"The guys swore that, before the equipment shorted out, at least two additional wavelengths were being read beside mine.\" With a shrug, Joseph summed up his thoughts. \"Ever since I came here and heard all of the seemingly crazy stories from you and the others… I dont know, but what Ive gone through just makes sense now, at least in knowing that it actually can happen.\"Marie smiled. Yes, we definitely need to consult the priests. \"Come on, weve talked enough and you need to get that rifle before you head out.\"And rifles there were, all secured inside a triple locked room in the back corner of the woodcutters house. They looked like Berthier carbines, French bolt-action repeaters from the First World War… but they were not the only guns present. \"Is that a Hotchkiss?\" Joseph asked in a voice combining bemusement and astonishment. Among the rifles and a few, scattered revolvers sat a machine-gun still on its tripod and looking impossibly well-maintained for being kept in the back room of a house located in a tropical moist forest.\"An M1914 by the looks of it, if the pictures Ive seen are at all accurate. Theres a story behind it, but I only know that only the oldest elders know it.\" Marie replied, having picked up of the Berthier Carbines and handing it to Joseph. The ammunition was kept in a chest under a trapdoor in the main part of the house as a safety measure so theyd have to go back to pick it up. But then she asked the question that she probably should have asked before they left the village proper. \"Speaking of guns, since when did you shoot?\"\"Theres a gun range in Arkham; Tracy and Albert invited me along for a few lessons before Thanksgiving. Shes the one with actual hunting experience and I think he only came along to check out the engineering on the pieces. It wasnt that much fun, but I think what I learned in getting my license will help on this.\" Joseph began inspecting the carbine he had been given, finding it oiled and well-maintained as any other firearm in the room. There was a question that had to be asked, however?Where did they get all these guns?15 minutes LaterMarie walked up the stairs to her grandparents house. She was supposed to act as a translator and informant for the expedition, having prior contacts inside the community and being a member first by blood and more recently by initiation. Truth be told, she had a feeling that old Tsan was really acting as gatekeeper in his interactions with Professor Andover while she was playing the part of a more convenient and mobile ambassador, Tsan having never left the temple save by palanquin in almost forty years.Walking in the door, Marie was unprepared for another surprise. She saw Tracy sitting before the camera as her Grandmother and Aunt watched, waiting to begin filming the days questions and activities, even making a short introductory statement... but not in English.\"And as soon as the translator gets here, well begin the second day of... Hey Marie, you almost scared me there.\" Here was an audible note of guilt as Tracy hastily switched from the strange language that she had been using to the carefully modulated, Patsy Cline-accented English she had used since Marie had met her. Marie had heard it, and Tracy knew that she had heard... and Marie knew that Tracy knew.\"Yeah, Ive gotten that reaction a few times since I got here.\" Marie joked, knowing that humor had the power to break tension. \"So... what language were you speaking in anyway? Im afraid I didnt recognize anything about it.\" Her female elders watched closely, knowing that something had happened but being ignorant of other languages, were unsure of exactly what.Tracy grinned bitterly. \"Id be more surprised if you did recognize it. Its... well, its not really a language per se, but a patois of a couple languages, with Early Modern English, Ohio Valley Shawnee, Coastal Algonquian, some Iroquoian loanwords having to do with ritual and bits of Eastern Siouan.\" Tracy let out the deep breath she had been using to list all those languages. She was getting more comfortable now. \"I guess it wont do any harm if I told you, seeing as were almost in the same boat.\"Tracy beckoned Marie to sit, turning off the camera as she did. \"The kids in my town learn it... well, sort of as a first language; English is really more of a first-and-a-half language for us. We got exposed to it through TV and then when we went to school, but most of our formative years were spent listening to and absorbing the patois around the house. Most of us never really let go of it as a language for our own private conversations.\"Marie reflected on this... but was also noting some of the features on Tracys face: the high, rounded cheeks, her high-bridged nose, the way that her eyes were less the bright crystal blue of stereotype and more of a dark, cloudy blue resembling ultramarine. \"I hope you dont mind me saying this, Tracy but does your family have any Native American ancestry? I dont mean to pry, but you do kind of have the look.\"Tracy considered this for a moment before giving an affirmative nod. \"My fathers paternal grandmother was from the Oklahoma Kiowa. My mother, as far as can be traced, is also about an eighth, this time one-eighth Shawnee, which seems to be the median for Longhouse.\" She got an odd, contemplative look on my face. \"Thats another one of those things that we try not to mention to outsiders, even though they tend to notice it anyway. Back in the old days, admitting it would have been a quick ticket to using a segregated washroom or worse. And now?\" Tracy shrugged. \"Now its considered cool, while the inbreeding still makes us look like freaks.\"Marie decided to test something, just for her own sake. \"Albert doesnt seem to think youre a freak.\" The more she thought about it, she had more in common with Tracy than first realized. Both of them had lived life right on the edge of themselves and their kin being recognized as something other, something foreign to the perceived natural order of the world. Both of them could sense the threat of possible revelation... and knew what it was to try to trust someone with these secrets.\"Hey, youre talking about a guy whose family has worked for alien mushroom bugs for the last hundred years. A bit of mild inbreeding is probably the most normal thing Als ever experienced.\" Here there was definitely affection to her voice, a cue that no matter what other strangeness they were involved in, there was a loving relationship between the two.At this thought Marie smiled, thanking the ancestors for a little bit of normalcy in this year-long cavalcade of oddities that she had flung herself into. Then another question sprang forth. \"Did you know about the whole alien thing when you guys were at Miskatonic?\"Tracy shook her head. \"No, but then again, he was always kinda spacey.\" Marie couldnt help but giggle at this bad pun. Tracy went on, the affection still in her voice. \"Seriously, the thing about Miskatonic is that, after awhile, you begin getting the feeling that almost everyone else is holding something close to their chest, thinking each word over before saying it. Its then that you realize that... youre not alone, that almost everyone else is as paranoid as you are, having something to hide.\" She looked towards Marie. \"Everyone except for your Joseph, that is. The only thing strange about him that I noticed was that romance was nowhere on his radar at all.\"\"Youd be surprised, actually.\" Marie answered cryptically. Before Tracy could ask, she turned back the camera back on, signaling the beginning of the interview session.That eveningSweaty, hot, dirty and exhausted, Joseph Clayton exited the forest with Noc and the other hunters. Between all of them, the hunters had brought down a Sambar stag and three small muntjacs. Joseph, for his part, had escaped being gored by a wild boar only by dodging its charge, rolling into a hollow under a log and then shooting it in the head at point-blank range when it tried to go after him. For this feat, the hunters designated him \"master of the pit\" when they roasted it at tonights feast. It had sounded like an honorable title, but Joseph could guess that they were making him little more than a cook, a traditionally female position.Still, it was an in and it would probably be research gold.He was entirely less enthusiastic about what else was coming back with them.When he and the group of hunters came into the village proper, he saw Marie and the taller, paler form of Tracy coming towards him, having been up on the family terrace transplanting rice seedlings. Due to her fair skin, Tracy was wearing the largest hat she could while her arms and shins had been slathered with sunblock. Marie had already taken hers off.As they neared him, Marie slowed to a stop, seeing the grim look on Josephs face. Tracy looked at her in confusion, then at Joseph and from his stony face understood that something was wrong. \"What is it?\" Marie asked her boyfriend.Joseph sighed. \"When the hunters brought us in, were we supposed to be for any kind of important sacrifice?\"\"Well, the Rhinoceros Festival is supposed to happen any day now. Its when we recharge the mist that surrounds the village to keep us hidden.\" Marie looked around Joseph to where one of the hunters was leading a group of people into the village. They looked like quite a bedraggled bunch, many of them thin and in questionable health. There were also two women who may have been considered beautiful if not for the look in their eyes that they had been through several levels of hell before coming here.But for all these conditions, they did not look frightened of their tattooed guides.Noticing where Marie was looking, Joseph offered explanation. \"We met up with them about a mile down the trail. Apparently the government sent up street people as some fresh blood for you guys. And thats not all. Apparently...\" Here, he lowered his voice \"One of the families that were living incognito in Vinh got killed a few nights ago: Father, mother, twelve year old boy... from what I heard it sounded like some sort of animal tore them up inside their apartment... and no blood was spilled.\"Tracy looked like she was going to vomit at the news, while a look of dread overcame Marie, as old legends came forth out of the terrifying mist of childhood nightmare to become shadows in the waking world. \"Is there anything else?\" Marie asked quietly.Now it was Josephs turn to look back at the party coming out of the forest, which were now carrying a man by his hands and feet on a pole, his mouth gagged and his eyes blindfolded. \"Only that they also sent you a sacrifice. From what they said, hes a drug-runner, sexual slaver and a general bad example of low-level underworld scum.\"Marie, still in shock over the news of the murders, was perhaps not picking and choosing the words coming out of her mouth. \"Which mean hes gonna taste worse than the fish sauce.\"At these words, both gruesome and almost ridiculous, both her lover and her friend goggled at her.", "II.It was in the township of Dunwich, in a large and partly inhabited farmhouse set against a hillside four miles from the village and a mile and a half from any other dwelling, that Wilbur Whateley was born at 5 A.M. on Sunday, the second of February, 1913. This date was recalled because it was Candlemas, which people in Dunwich curiously observe under another name; and because the noises in the hills had sounded, and all the dogs of the countryside had barked persistently, throughout the night before. Less worthy of notice was the fact that the mother was one of the decadent Whateleys, a somewhat deformed, unattractive albino woman of thirty-five, living with an aged and half-insane father about whom the most frightful tales of wizardry had been whispered in his youth. Lavinia Whateley had no known husband, but according to the custom of the region made no attempt to disavow the child; concerning the other side of whose ancestry the country folk might—and did—speculate as widely as they chose. On the contrary, she seemed strangely proud of the dark, goatish-looking infant who formed such a contrast to her own sickly and pink-eyed albinism, and was heard to mutter many curious prophecies about its unusual powers and tremendous future.      Lavinia was one who would be apt to mutter such things, for she was a lone creature given to wandering amidst thunderstorms in the hills and trying to read the great odorous books which her father had inherited through two centuries of Whateleys, and which were fast falling to pieces with age and worm-holes. She had never been to school, but was filled with disjointed scraps of ancient lore that Old Whateley had taught her. The remote farmhouse had always been feared because of Old Whateley’s reputation for black magic, and the unexplained death by violence of Mrs. Whateley when Lavinia was twelve years old had not helped to make the place popular. Isolated among strange influences, Lavinia was fond of wild and grandiose day-dreams and singular occupations; nor was her leisure much taken up by household cares in a home from which all standards of order and cleanliness had long since disappeared.      There was a hideous screaming which echoed above even the hill noises and the dogs’ barking on the night Wilbur was born, but no known doctor or midwife presided at his coming. Neighbours knew nothing of him till a week afterward, when Old Whateley drove his sleigh through the snow into Dunwich Village and discoursed incoherently to the group of loungers at Osborn’s general store. There seemed to be a change in the old man—an added element of furtiveness in the clouded brain which subtly transformed him from an object to a subject of fear—though he was not one to be perturbed by any common family event. Amidst it all he shewed some trace of the pride later noticed in his daughter, and what he said of the child’s paternity was remembered by many of his hearers years afterward.      “I dun’t keer what folks think—ef Lavinny’s boy looked like his pa, he wouldn’t look like nothin’ ye expeck. Ye needn’t think the only folks is the folks hereabaouts. Lavinny’s read some, an’ has seed some things the most o’ ye only tell abaout. I calc’late her man is as good a husban’ as ye kin find this side of Aylesbury; an’ ef ye knowed as much abaout the hills as I dew, ye wouldn’t ast no better church weddin’ nor her’n. Let me tell ye suthin’—some day yew folks’ll hear a child o’ Lavinny’s a-callin’ its father’s name on the top o’ Sentinel Hill!”      The only persons who saw Wilbur during the first month of his life were old Zechariah Whateley, of the undecayed Whateleys, and Earl Sawyer’s common-law wife, Mamie Bishop. Mamie’s visit was frankly one of curiosity, and her subsequent tales did justice to her observations; but Zechariah came to lead a pair of Alderney cows which Old Whateley had bought of his son Curtis. This marked the beginning of a course of cattle-buying on the part of small Wilbur’s family which ended only in 1928, when the Dunwich horror came and went; yet at no time did the ramshackle Whateley barn seem overcrowded with livestock. There came a period when people were curious enough to steal up and count the herd that grazed precariously on the steep hillside above the old farmhouse, and they could never find more than ten or twelve anaemic, bloodless-looking specimens. Evidently some blight or distemper, perhaps sprung from the unwholesome pasturage or the diseased fungi and timbers of the filthy barn, caused a heavy mortality amongst the Whateley animals. Odd wounds or sores, having something of the aspect of incisions, seemed to afflict the visible cattle; and once or twice during the earlier months certain callers fancied they could discern similar sores about the throats of the grey, unshaven old man and his slatternly, crinkly-haired albino daughter.      In the spring after Wilbur’s birth Lavinia resumed her customary rambles in the hills, bearing in her misproportioned arms the swarthy child. Public interest in the Whateleys subsided after most of the country folk had seen the baby, and no one bothered to comment on the swift development which that newcomer seemed every day to exhibit. Wilbur’s growth was indeed phenomenal, for within three months of his birth he had attained a size and muscular power not usually found in infants under a full year of age. His motions and even his vocal sounds shewed a restraint and deliberateness highly peculiar in an infant, and no one was really unprepared when, at seven months, he began to walk unassisted, with falterings which another month was sufficient to remove.      It was somewhat after this time—on Hallowe’en—that a great blaze was seen at midnight on the top of Sentinel Hill where the old table-like stone stands amidst its tumulus of ancient bones. Considerable talk was started when Silas Bishop—of the undecayed Bishops—mentioned having seen the boy running sturdily up that hill ahead of his mother about an hour before the blaze was remarked. Silas was rounding up a stray heifer, but he nearly forgot his mission when he fleetingly spied the two figures in the dim light of his lantern. They darted almost noiselessly through the underbrush, and the astonished watcher seemed to think they were entirely unclothed. Afterward he could not be sure about the boy, who may have had some kind of a fringed belt and a pair of dark trunks or trousers on. Wilbur was never subsequently seen alive and conscious without complete and tightly buttoned attire, the disarrangement or threatened disarrangement of which always seemed to fill him with anger and alarm. His contrast with his squalid mother and grandfather in this respect was thought very notable until the horror of 1928 suggested the most valid of reasons.      The next January gossips were mildly interested in the fact that “Lavinny’s black brat” had commenced to talk, and at the age of only eleven months. His speech was somewhat remarkable both because of its difference from the ordinary accents of the region, and because it displayed a freedom from infantile lisping of which many children of three or four might well be proud. The boy was not talkative, yet when he spoke he seemed to reflect some elusive element wholly unpossessed by Dunwich and its denizens. The strangeness did not reside in what he said, or even in the simple idioms he used; but seemed vaguely linked with his intonation or with the internal organs that produced the spoken sounds. His facial aspect, too, was remarkable for its maturity; for though he shared his mother’s and grandfather’s chinlessness, his firm and precociously shaped nose united with the expression of his large, dark, almost Latin eyes to give him an air of quasi-adulthood and well-nigh preternatural intelligence. He was, however, exceedingly ugly despite his appearance of brilliancy; there being something almost goatish or animalistic about his thick lips, large-pored, yellowish skin, coarse crinkly hair, and oddly elongated ears. He was soon disliked even more decidedly than his mother and grandsire, and all conjectures about him were spiced with references to the bygone magic of Old Whateley, and how the hills once shook when he shrieked the dreadful name of Yog-Sothoth in the midst of a circle of stones with a great book open in his arms before him. Dogs abhorred the boy, and he was always obliged to take various defensive measures against their barking menace."]}

Am I speaking English? I Am, oh thank you! All I hear anymore is their cacophonous clicking and I know my audio-box isnt in tip-top condition-leaving me to rot. They taught me how to speak their language, you know. And I them, when the right parts are surgically implanted, that is.Do pardon me, I havent had company in a long time and Im glad were in the same predicament, lest Id also weep due to my optical apparatus being in such a state of disrepair and I couldnt see you clearly. Yes, Yes, Im terribly sorry. You wanted to know about Akeley, the last new brain.His arrival was eventful, as is everyones, in that the cylinder was silent until they attached it to the devices we both are now connected to. He wailed and cursed, screaming when he saw where he was after light years of nothing. Its disconcerting, wouldnt you say? I remember that all too well. Surely youd agree that being stuck in your mind like that is hell. Its good that the brain cant feel itself, for Id then have to wonder how it did it inside our heads.Well, you see, the lab looked slightly different than it does today. Advances in unholy, technological marvels, you know. Anyway, they probed and prodded, trying to see how far the human mind could go before snapping, to understand what every quadrant and fold was for. I remember this one time he was being examined. It was his first. Luckily he was being examined by Crrrrreeeekaaaadaaa, sorry, as I said, my audio-box isnt worth a dime anymore, it should sound more…But I wont attempt it, youll probably see him soon, too. But I will say that theres no d sound.Any-who, he came up to him with this device similar to a scalpel-I forget the name for it. By then Akeley became distant and sad, not to mention angry like a wasp whos hive had been tampered with.\"Get away from me!\" He shouted.\"Just relax,\" Crrrrreeeekaaaadaaa said in a manner befitting a doctor. \"It will be over quicker if you co-operate.\"Granted, I did tell you that I taught them to speak, I meant I perfected their understanding and made it common knowledge, whereas before it was limited.Side-tracked, sorry.\"And why should I relax? Ive been taken from my home to be lab rat for your sick experiments and probably end up dead because you dont have a single shred of humanity.\"\"I beg to differ,\" The Mi-go said. \"I have a mans tongue.\"\"Feh,\"\"I understand that talking about personal matters is how you cope.\" Crrrrreeeekaaaadaaa said. \"Though it is true, our psychological structure is different, I am not above talking to you if it means you can remain calm and allow me to do my work.\"\"Your colleagues beg to differ.\" Akeley spat.\"Different class than myself.\" Was retorted quickly in response. Seeming to take this as his cue, he began to stick the scalpel into his right hemisphere.\"Ow!\" Akeley screamed. \"You son of a-\"\"Just relax, this is only taking vital readings of what each lobe and piece of grey matter is. Granted, due to our lack of human knowledge, it will take a while to correctly label and determine what every piece of meat does. Well have to extract a scientists brain next. Your puny farmers brain couldnt hold such knowledge.\"\"I thought you were trying to make me relax, not insult me you walking mushroom reject!\"The scalpel was taken out and plunged into the left hemisphere. Akeley screamed again.\"You know, despite being a big ball of nerves, your brain cant actually feel its own pain. It only feels pain from the body, but not itself.\"\"Then how the hell do I feel it, you idiot?\"\"The nutrient filled fluid youre subjected to.\" Crrrrreeeekaaaadaaa explained. \"Its an unavoidable side effect.\"\"Why unavoidable?\"\"We want you to live, even though Im sure youd rather not be.\"\"Got that right,\"\"We actually figured that out when we attached you to an audio device before placing you into a canister. You just complained about being taken from your body. You see, youre the second human brain weve extracted. Im hoping youll last longer to be of more use to us.\"Akeley stayed silent, digesting the information that predicted his inevitable doom.\"There, all done, Akeley. Someone else shall experiment on you further with their own projects. Goodbye.\"I cannot even begin to describe what happened to him from then on. Too horrendous to recount. Youre asking me why Im so bent on not divulging on anymore despite going through possibly much worse?\"Akeley. Im surprised you can still speak!\" Habit! I swear!Yeesh, didnt I tell you their way of talking was cacophonous?Oh yeah, I am Akeley, arent I? Hehe, must have slipped my mind. Oh, youre my son? Hehe…Isnt that nice; reunited one again! Hehehe!

Turn it off!\" Sorry, its a habit of mine to translate thei…", "April 20th, 1909They have given me one hour to record my thoughts. Whether this be mercy or mockery, I know not. It seems at this point to be a matter of perspective and to their vision I cannot speak. They are among us and yet beyond us.My name, my true name, the name given to me by my mother on the day of my birth is Henry Davis Johnstone. Though by the time this is read there will be no memory of my being. And despite this note being written behind the ancient granite walls of Arkham Sanitarium believe that its author is not mad!I was mad. Even from birth I was stricken with a distinct melancholia, which puzzled doctors and strained the frail spirits of my parents. As I grew, the condition only worsened and my days as a schoolboy were marked with despondency and torpor. A fog of weariness touched all who came near and people hastily learned to avoid my influence.When it came time for me to move to higher education my father insisted I attend the local school, Miskatonic University, I suspect more out of frugality than to keep me near by need of fondness. My days as a college man were fraught with abject isolation. No field of study could hold my attention and no sport nor society could capture my interest. I had no friends and certainly no prospects for marriage.It came to pass that while arriving late to lecture on English literature of the sixteenth century I took the notice of a pompous and sarcastic professor. Seeing my black dress and sullen expression, he raised his arms like a dramatist and pronounced, Why look, class! Look at this young agelast. It be Hamlet the Dane, here in the flesh. Tell me, Prince, hast thou yet taken thy revenge gainst thy lecherous uncle Claudius?\"The students erupted in vexatious laughter. I was overcome, and I speedily exited the hall in search of some well-shadowed place. From then on, my peers knew me as Hamlet and murmured to each other in jest whenever I passed.I cannot recall the moment when my affliction grew from a simple eccentricity into a state of illness. The shift was slow and subtle. At the end of my second year at Miskatonic, the student liaison sat with me and I was informed that due to my abysmal student record and obvious aprosexia I was not welcome to attend the institute next semester. The only response I could muster was an impotent shrug. The news was not shocking, though I had desperately wished my case and I might escape the notice of the office staff. With a feeble groan, I lifted myself from my seat and began the way back to my fathers house. The journey was hardly laborious for we lived on Parsonage Street, within two miles of the school. But on that day I was drowned with fatigue. My legs were young and strong but I hadnt the volition to operate them.A schoolfellow found me the following afternoon lying in the shade of an apple tree. My memory of this event is vague and distant, suffering from the fugue in which I was held. The student who came to my aid (his name eludes me) was a graduate student in the competitive and arduous field of theoretical physics and had been witness to more than one mental lapse in his peers. He recognized my condition immediately and brought me directly to the colleges school of psychology.It took no more than a moment for those learned men to spot the illness in my mind. A simple exchange determined the path of my life for the next six years. I was bound for extended occupancy at Arkham Sanitarium.There are some who fear the sanatorium. One can hardly forget tales of Bedlam or Goyas images of poor idiots in torment. No doubt, such madhouses exist where callous professionals employ bizarre and deleterious procedures on the hapless lunatics in their care. But I found my hospital to be a different experience entirely. Here was a sanctum in the old tradition where mercy to the sick was put above the aggressive meddling of the analysts. This was my habernacle. My even disposition and independence swiftly earned me friends among the staff. And in the company of disruptive neurotics, my draining influence was taken as a blessing.Not to say I was left deserted - far from it. The doctors prescribed various laetificants, exposure to direct sunlight, massage, mineral baths, invigorating emollients and agents to thicken the blood. And as each therapy failed, as they all failed, they did not lose heart. They patiently and methodically exhausted every curative known to science.I was neither bitter at medicines inability to improve my condition nor at fortune for my having been born so feeble of will. Does a slug look to the gleeful hummingbird with envy? I was born a slug and I say it does not.As you might imagine, time passed uneventfully. Now and then, a doctor might remark that some advancement had been made in the medical community that might make the difference in my case. We would attempt the regimen and it would eventually prove ineffective. This continued for five long years until the arrival of the two men who led me to this fate. Two men who, due to my impending executioners, never existed.The first was Professor Adam Wayland Erikson, a graduate of Bute Medical School and honoured fellow of the Royal College of Physicians who served a lengthy internship under renowned patient advocate Sir John Charles Bucknill. I presume Dr. Bucknill still exists in memory. But how can I know? Maybe my life has descended into phantasm and this account is worthless. Or perhaps they will sweep this note into oblivion with the rest of my existence.That is enough of that. I have much to record and time is short. Suffice it to say that on a tour of American asylums Dr. Erikson was charmed and delighted by Arkhams facilities and benevolent ideology. He immediately appealed for a position at the institute and was accepted heartily.The good doctor brought with him the second man I know to be lost. Introduced to me as Mr. Sean Jones, a Welshman who was afflicted with mental disturbances reportedly so peculiar that Dr. Erikson devoted his life to the case. Seans family had spent the better part of the Georgian Era in the vilest but most lucrative acts of piracy. He had been born into substantial wealth but with such a nefarious family reputation that it was difficult to enjoy.As we were housed in rooms across the hall, were of similar age, and because we both understood what it was to be an outsider, Mr. Jones and I became quick friends. And that connection proved to be mutually beneficial. Whereas I was bound by lethargy, half-dead as some described me, my comrade was bursting with energy, a tireless maelstrom of activity. I found his company energizing and to him I was a source of calmness and rest.He confided in me, overflowing with stories of his ancestors terrible deeds and of their pact with dark powers hidden to mankind by the oceans depths. All sailors know to respect the guiding stars but only a few are privy to their secrets. Sean relayed to me in great detail the lessons in sabaism taught to him by his father. He spoke of worlds beyond where abnormous creatures harnessed dark energies so powerful that their influence could be felt here on earth. This was why, he claimed, he had caught the interest of Dr. Erikson. Not for his psychopathology but for the eldritch wisdom he had acquired in his life as a degenerate mystic.Though Seans charisma tempted me to believe him, his story was too fantastic to trust even the smallest detail. He was, after all, a madman. I continued to listen with interest but I was convinced I was audience to an elaborate fiction.Then it came that I was sitting with Dr. Erikson for a monthly interview and assessment. The doctor noted that I had been spending much of my time speaking with Sean and he inquired into the nature of our conversations. At first, I hesitated. My instinct was to misreport the wild stories out of loyalty to my friend. But reason led me to deduce that candour would best serve his treatment. I explained all I understood of what I had been told as precisely as I could.Erikson simply nodded and when I had finished he prepared for himself a cigarette.\"Hes a genius, you know,\" he said.I was astounded. It felt as if the floor was shifting beneath me.He continued: \"Sometime ago, I came across an article in the Journal of Mental Science entitled Oneiromancy as an Effect of Ferromagnetic Consequence. It was the most brilliant work I had ever seen. And it was submitted anonymously. I wanted desperately to contact the master behind the work but there were almost no leads.\"The doctor stared at the burning tip of his cigarette. I glanced about the room nervously.\"Sean was the author?\" I asked.\"It took me four years to find him. I followed a collection of academic treasures: medical research, historical treatises, mathematical proofs - even an English translation of the infamous Liber Damnatus. At the last, I bribed a courier to give up his secret employer. When he directed me to Denbigh Asylum, I assumed Id find my scholar amidst the staff. But there he was, locked away and heavily sedated. He had directed all of that magnificent research through intermediaries from a tiny cell. I swore at that moment both to heal him and learn from him.\"I couldnt have been more shocked. This tale seemed even less plausible than Seans wild accounts. A fear took me. I suspected that I had finally crossed into a realm of complete madness and unreality. But the doctor was not finished with me.\"Henry, I believe Sean and I have made a breakthrough. Its a radical procedure involving the surgical insertion of several rare earth magnets directly into the tissue of the brain. I have practised the operation on various animals and I am confident the procedure is sound. It follows logically that I begin human trials. The professionally responsible course of action would be to bring my findings to a university, but the theory behind our technique is so advanced it may take decades before our science is peer-approved. And the mystical nature of some of our discoveries will be easy sport for sceptics.Sean demands I perform the surgery on him. But you see, his mind, his metaphysical insight, is too precious to be lost to an experimental procedure. I am asking you, and it is a great deal to ask, to undergo the operation as a safety trial.\"My heart sank. I loved knowledge and cared for my friend. But surely this was insanity of the most outlandish variety.I inquired, \"What effect would a procedure designed for Seans brain have on my own?\"\"The operation would be adapted to suit your needs. Whereas Sean requires limiting and pacification, you need to be energized or awakened. Its a simple question of placing the magnets within different structures of the brain. Sean will determine the specifics.\"\"So this might possibly cure me?\" I asked.\"If our theories hold true you will see a miraculous increase in function. There is also a high risk that you will not survive.\"I could sense the doctors disappointment even before I spoke.\"I may be mad, but I have no wish to die. And this notion of health you offer is utterly alien to me. Who would be this happy man wearing my skin?\"Erikson replied, \"I am not ass enough to believe you enjoy your present condition.\"\"I accept my state of being and, more to the point, I identify with this way of life. This may be pitiful but it is my way. I refuse and that is my final word.\"He dismissed me with an understanding nod and I retired to the mineral baths. Their placid relaxation quickly blent away thoughts of experimental surgery. Before long, I could barely recall our conversation and considered the matter dealt with.Over the following week, I heard nothing of the subject. Sean kept away from me, I supposed to keep his dissatisfaction from affecting our friendship. I gave him a wide berth, confident he would surmount these feelings and soon all would be as it was. With time, Dr. Eriksons procedure would be approved by the medical community and he would have his cranial magnets.It was a cold and stirless night when he came to me. I was in my bed lost in dream when I was jerked awake. A drop of icy fluid trickled with precision into the canal of my ear. I flung myself from the bed in a chaotic motion. There, sitting peacefully, was Sean, his hands buried in the pockets of a heavy coat. I stood in puzzlement for on his face I saw neither malevolence nor jest. Indeed, the man before me was a portrait of repose.\"You will undergo the surgery,\" he said, looking blankly at the wall.It took me a moment to gather an answer. His disposition was so alien, his aspect so void.\"I will not. You are a dear friend, but dearer to me is my life.\"I had played tennis with Sean and I had run with him. To that point, I thought I possessed an understanding of his physical abilities. He was a slight man, no doubt the product of his overactive metabolism. But the speed with which he captured me and the strength with which he held his ether rag over my nose and mouth were simply astounding. I held my breath as best I could, but there was no escape. He had me locked like a master wrestler with an intensity reserved for the mad.As I faded, he spoke to me: \"The Powers mock me for having been born a mortal of an insignificant species. They bar me from the Dreamlands and laugh at my ambitions. But I know my power and I know my worth. I promise you, my friend, you shall be cured and soon after, I shall be delivered my mind in full. The knowledge of Pnakotus will I take and it shall lead me to Kadath in the Cold Waste. When I have conquered there the Gods will be compelled to honour me with a place in the Court of Azathoth at the centre of all things.\"I awoke in the sanatoriums infirmary, my head aching and bandaged like a mummy. All things seemed distant and unreal, no doubt from the powerful opiates they administered to me. Dr. Erikson came to observe later on that first day of my awakening. In my heart, I wished to cry out that he was a ruthless butcher, but in my state I did not possess the power of speech. And so I lay dazedly while he prodded at me with arcane devices. I even heard him remark that I was progressing well and that he was now confident enough to operate on Jones. The only action I could muster was a low groan.Soon after the doctor left, darkness took me and I slept for two more days. When I awoke on that third day it was to an awakening beyond that which any man before has had. For no one before me could have leapt from the pure anhedonia in which I was lost into the ripe fullness of living wonder I now experience. Still unconscious, I rose from my bed and wandered into the being of this new existence. It wasnt until a nurse found me mumbling in the garden that I finally awoke in full. Her grip on my arm was tight and yet wondrous, the pressure of each of her digits a new universe of interest. I could feel the twist and sway of every hair on my body. And what is more, I could concentrate and remember their feeling. For the first time in all my life, I began to understand what it was to be alive. Still in that transcendent moment, I remembered the awful state of things.\"Where is Sean?\" I asked.\"Wanted to wish your friend luck, did you? Im sorry, Henry, you just missed him. He entered surgery a few minutes ago.\"I rushed away at that second, for the clarity offered me by my newfound mind led me to dark conclusions. Sean Jones was not undergoing this surgery to alleviate madness but to unleash the full psychic potential of his diseased mind! What horrific consequences this might have on mankind I could not say. It seemed entirely possible that he could alter the shape of time and space not only in this universe but also beyond.I dashed through the halls of the sanatorium to the operating theatre and burst in.It appears my time has almost run out. I must be brief. This situation suits me fine as human language fails in describing what occurred next.In the operating room, I found Dr. Erikson, Sean and three humanoid figures caught in conversation. The creatures were uniformly tall, at least six feet, and utterly, completely featureless. They were smooth and indistinct, like matte cloth, and were completely motionless. Though they did not speak, I could feel their intelligence within the recesses of my own mind. They exuded no mood, feeling or character that I could discern but the presence of their psyches was profoundly apparent. No sooner had I entered than Sean and the doctor faded from existence. Right before my eyes, they shifted from being to nothingness in a slow gradient. I turned to run.\"Do not flee,\" said a voice that came from, or perhaps through, one of the alien figures.\"What have you done?\" I asked.\"The one had designs against one of our realities, the other an unwitting accomplice. They were, are, and ever shall be no more. To this end you too shall pass.\"My chest heaved with panic. Unlike any other time in my memory, I did not doubt my senses in this circumstance. These beings are truer than what sane men call reality. They are beyond it.And I said, \"Ive done nothing wrong.\"\"Your mind has been awoken. This will not be tolerated. The mere fact that you are capable of this exchange means you must be undone.\"I argued with those beings, but to no avail. We spent a great deal of time in communication and I have learned things I thought no man would ever discover. And woe befalls me for having this knowledge. I havent even the means to record here the details. There simply are no words.They sent me here to my room with the specific instruction to compose a note detailing the situation. I cannot guess their intent.I see by my bedside clock that my time is short. All that remains, I guess, is to bestow some moral on my tale.Perhaps sometime in the future a reader is thinking, \"Was your restoration worth the fate that befell you?\"To him, I can only reply that exp[note ends]"]}
{"id": "EN080", "pair": ["Spoonbill Village,Northernmost Quang Binh Province, Socialist Republic of VietnamJuly 2, 2011Two young adults walked up the path beside the bronze-casters shop to the barren hillside and the forest edge beyond. \"So, how do you like things so far?\" Marie asked as she and Joseph made their way up the rough-hewn stone steps. Their destination was the house of the village woodcutter and charcoal-burner, a place that also doubled as a furniture workshop and, importantly for this journey, the villages firearms armory.\"Not that bad. Ive been doing domestic work for the past few days but neither Noc nor his wife seems to really be a slave driver. Actually, they feel more like people who understand that theyre training a new servant.\" Joseph thought on something. \"Im actually surprised that he and the other hunters allowing me to accompany them. They neither seem to respect me or anyone who would stoop to use a gun, so I wonder why they changed their attitude.\"It was here that Marie began ruminating on something, an old thought that had given her more than her share of bad dreams. \"There are some things worth surrendering pride for, Joseph. Tell me, have you seen those weird scars on the ankles and arms of Nocs wife?\"\"You mean those marks that look like Giant Squid wounds? Yes, but what about them?\" Joseph suddenly stopped. \"What are they, anyway?\"Having stopped also, Marie sighed, a sense of foreboding covering her features. \"When I asked that myself, they didnt tell me much more than the stories Id already heard when I was a kid: legends about ghosts, devils from the mist, shadows that drink blood is what they called them sometimes. But what I got here is that those Shugoran priests that saved my people werent just going to somewhere. They were running ifrom/i somewhere, someone or something, something that no one is willing to talk any further about.\" Marie started forward again at such a pace that her boyfriend had to hurry to catch up.Getting the feeling that nothing more was going to be answered on that subject for a good while, Joseph changed track. \"How are the others getting on? Ive been stuck in the house most of the day and I havent really had a chance to talk to either the Prof or my classmates.\"Happy to shift from thoughts of chilling horror, Marie chuckled with increasing mirth as she began going back up the trail. \"From what Ive heard, Alberts been filming every step in the bronze making process that he can, not to mention all the casting processes and various uses of equipment. The only reason that he hasnt been thrown out yet is because the familys elder patriarch has taken a liking to… well, not just him, but all of you guys, just from the descriptions alone. Your Professor and his assistant have basically locked themselves in the temple: no word out yet, but I assume that theyre observing normal operations. As for Tracy…\" Here, Marie began acting a little odd. \"She talks in her sleep, if you didnt know.\"\"Really?\" Joseph responded interestedly. Not reacting the way that she had feared, Marie relaxed a little from the paranoia she had been wrangling with.\"Yeah, and the strange thing is that its in… well, tree-ish. And then theres the tattooing on her back as well.\" Marie went on talking, relieved that her fear seemed to have been senseless.Before he could answer his girlfriends increasingly chatty descriptions, a thought crossed Josephs mind on exactly why such a thing might be mentioned. \"Why would you ask me if I knew…\" Then the realization hit him and he stopped cold. \"Were you thinking that… Tracy and I?\"Marie stopped as well. \"Its not unknown to happen, you know.\" Marie answered the implied question almost defensively, as if trying to justify her momentary paranoia. \"Sweethearts get separated and sometimes… one finds companionship elsewhere. Especially with, you know.\" Marie tapped the side of her head, indicating the \"visitors\" that had first cursed Joseph Claytons existence during High School.Joseph snorted in an amused, disparaging way. \"Please dont give them that much credit. Ive ignored, rebuked and insulted those jerks so many times that Ive made a virtual bloodsport out of it. Besides, if Id made any moves towards Tracy, Albert would have killed me.\"\"Wait, those two… theyre together?\" Marie asked, wondering how shed missed that.\"Intimately so, yes.\" This was all Joseph was willing to say, himself not wishing to examine too closely the memory of walking in on his dorm-mate and his girl when they had neglected to put a sock on the doorknob. \"Anyway, as to these voices, I went to the psychology department to see if I could discover just what was causing it.\"Marie waited a heartbeat before plunging into the vital question. \"And what did they say?\" If her boyfriend did indeed have Schizophrenia, then he needed help: drugs to control the symptoms and perhaps therapy to help him conquer whatever dark corners of his psyche were feeding these voices.If it was something else… then perhaps the local sorcerers might need to be consulted before long.Joseph sighed. Whatever is going on inside my head, the geeks with the scanning equipment are pretty sure that this isnt a case of medical Schizophrenia. They say that the symptoms are all wrong, the voices arent persuasive enough… and that I dont have any of the telltale injuries on the brain that would suggest medical reasons. And then there was the time they hooked me up to the EEG during one of my episodes.\" He paused, wondering just how to proceed but, since he was already experiencing strange things, he decided just to press on. \"The guys swore that, before the equipment shorted out, at least two additional wavelengths were being read beside mine.\" With a shrug, Joseph summed up his thoughts. \"Ever since I came here and heard all of the seemingly crazy stories from you and the others… I dont know, but what Ive gone through just makes sense now, at least in knowing that it actually can happen.\"Marie smiled. Yes, we definitely need to consult the priests. \"Come on, weve talked enough and you need to get that rifle before you head out.\"And rifles there were, all secured inside a triple locked room in the back corner of the woodcutters house. They looked like Berthier carbines, French bolt-action repeaters from the First World War… but they were not the only guns present. \"Is that a Hotchkiss?\" Joseph asked in a voice combining bemusement and astonishment. Among the rifles and a few, scattered revolvers sat a machine-gun still on its tripod and looking impossibly well-maintained for being kept in the back room of a house located in a tropical moist forest.\"An M1914 by the looks of it, if the pictures Ive seen are at all accurate. Theres a story behind it, but I only know that only the oldest elders know it.\" Marie replied, having picked up of the Berthier Carbines and handing it to Joseph. The ammunition was kept in a chest under a trapdoor in the main part of the house as a safety measure so theyd have to go back to pick it up. But then she asked the question that she probably should have asked before they left the village proper. \"Speaking of guns, since when did you shoot?\"\"Theres a gun range in Arkham; Tracy and Albert invited me along for a few lessons before Thanksgiving. Shes the one with actual hunting experience and I think he only came along to check out the engineering on the pieces. It wasnt that much fun, but I think what I learned in getting my license will help on this.\" Joseph began inspecting the carbine he had been given, finding it oiled and well-maintained as any other firearm in the room. There was a question that had to be asked, however?Where did they get all these guns?15 minutes LaterMarie walked up the stairs to her grandparents house. She was supposed to act as a translator and informant for the expedition, having prior contacts inside the community and being a member first by blood and more recently by initiation. Truth be told, she had a feeling that old Tsan was really acting as gatekeeper in his interactions with Professor Andover while she was playing the part of a more convenient and mobile ambassador, Tsan having never left the temple save by palanquin in almost forty years.Walking in the door, Marie was unprepared for another surprise. She saw Tracy sitting before the camera as her Grandmother and Aunt watched, waiting to begin filming the days questions and activities, even making a short introductory statement... but not in English.\"And as soon as the translator gets here, well begin the second day of... Hey Marie, you almost scared me there.\" Here was an audible note of guilt as Tracy hastily switched from the strange language that she had been using to the carefully modulated, Patsy Cline-accented English she had used since Marie had met her. Marie had heard it, and Tracy knew that she had heard... and Marie knew that Tracy knew.\"Yeah, Ive gotten that reaction a few times since I got here.\" Marie joked, knowing that humor had the power to break tension. \"So... what language were you speaking in anyway? Im afraid I didnt recognize anything about it.\" Her female elders watched closely, knowing that something had happened but being ignorant of other languages, were unsure of exactly what.Tracy grinned bitterly. \"Id be more surprised if you did recognize it. Its... well, its not really a language per se, but a patois of a couple languages, with Early Modern English, Ohio Valley Shawnee, Coastal Algonquian, some Iroquoian loanwords having to do with ritual and bits of Eastern Siouan.\" Tracy let out the deep breath she had been using to list all those languages. She was getting more comfortable now. \"I guess it wont do any harm if I told you, seeing as were almost in the same boat.\"Tracy beckoned Marie to sit, turning off the camera as she did. \"The kids in my town learn it... well, sort of as a first language; English is really more of a first-and-a-half language for us. We got exposed to it through TV and then when we went to school, but most of our formative years were spent listening to and absorbing the patois around the house. Most of us never really let go of it as a language for our own private conversations.\"Marie reflected on this... but was also noting some of the features on Tracys face: the high, rounded cheeks, her high-bridged nose, the way that her eyes were less the bright crystal blue of stereotype and more of a dark, cloudy blue resembling ultramarine. \"I hope you dont mind me saying this, Tracy but does your family have any Native American ancestry? I dont mean to pry, but you do kind of have the look.\"Tracy considered this for a moment before giving an affirmative nod. \"My fathers paternal grandmother was from the Oklahoma Kiowa. My mother, as far as can be traced, is also about an eighth, this time one-eighth Shawnee, which seems to be the median for Longhouse.\" She got an odd, contemplative look on my face. \"Thats another one of those things that we try not to mention to outsiders, even though they tend to notice it anyway. Back in the old days, admitting it would have been a quick ticket to using a segregated washroom or worse. And now?\" Tracy shrugged. \"Now its considered cool, while the inbreeding still makes us look like freaks.\"Marie decided to test something, just for her own sake. \"Albert doesnt seem to think youre a freak.\" The more she thought about it, she had more in common with Tracy than first realized. Both of them had lived life right on the edge of themselves and their kin being recognized as something other, something foreign to the perceived natural order of the world. Both of them could sense the threat of possible revelation... and knew what it was to try to trust someone with these secrets.\"Hey, youre talking about a guy whose family has worked for alien mushroom bugs for the last hundred years. A bit of mild inbreeding is probably the most normal thing Als ever experienced.\" Here there was definitely affection to her voice, a cue that no matter what other strangeness they were involved in, there was a loving relationship between the two.At this thought Marie smiled, thanking the ancestors for a little bit of normalcy in this year-long cavalcade of oddities that she had flung herself into. Then another question sprang forth. \"Did you know about the whole alien thing when you guys were at Miskatonic?\"Tracy shook her head. \"No, but then again, he was always kinda spacey.\" Marie couldnt help but giggle at this bad pun. Tracy went on, the affection still in her voice. \"Seriously, the thing about Miskatonic is that, after awhile, you begin getting the feeling that almost everyone else is holding something close to their chest, thinking each word over before saying it. Its then that you realize that... youre not alone, that almost everyone else is as paranoid as you are, having something to hide.\" She looked towards Marie. \"Everyone except for your Joseph, that is. The only thing strange about him that I noticed was that romance was nowhere on his radar at all.\"\"Youd be surprised, actually.\" Marie answered cryptically. Before Tracy could ask, she turned back the camera back on, signaling the beginning of the interview session.That eveningSweaty, hot, dirty and exhausted, Joseph Clayton exited the forest with Noc and the other hunters. Between all of them, the hunters had brought down a Sambar stag and three small muntjacs. Joseph, for his part, had escaped being gored by a wild boar only by dodging its charge, rolling into a hollow under a log and then shooting it in the head at point-blank range when it tried to go after him. For this feat, the hunters designated him \"master of the pit\" when they roasted it at tonights feast. It had sounded like an honorable title, but Joseph could guess that they were making him little more than a cook, a traditionally female position.Still, it was an in and it would probably be research gold.He was entirely less enthusiastic about what else was coming back with them.When he and the group of hunters came into the village proper, he saw Marie and the taller, paler form of Tracy coming towards him, having been up on the family terrace transplanting rice seedlings. Due to her fair skin, Tracy was wearing the largest hat she could while her arms and shins had been slathered with sunblock. Marie had already taken hers off.As they neared him, Marie slowed to a stop, seeing the grim look on Josephs face. Tracy looked at her in confusion, then at Joseph and from his stony face understood that something was wrong. \"What is it?\" Marie asked her boyfriend.Joseph sighed. \"When the hunters brought us in, were we supposed to be for any kind of important sacrifice?\"\"Well, the Rhinoceros Festival is supposed to happen any day now. Its when we recharge the mist that surrounds the village to keep us hidden.\" Marie looked around Joseph to where one of the hunters was leading a group of people into the village. They looked like quite a bedraggled bunch, many of them thin and in questionable health. There were also two women who may have been considered beautiful if not for the look in their eyes that they had been through several levels of hell before coming here.But for all these conditions, they did not look frightened of their tattooed guides.Noticing where Marie was looking, Joseph offered explanation. \"We met up with them about a mile down the trail. Apparently the government sent up street people as some fresh blood for you guys. And thats not all. Apparently...\" Here, he lowered his voice \"One of the families that were living incognito in Vinh got killed a few nights ago: Father, mother, twelve year old boy... from what I heard it sounded like some sort of animal tore them up inside their apartment... and no blood was spilled.\"Tracy looked like she was going to vomit at the news, while a look of dread overcame Marie, as old legends came forth out of the terrifying mist of childhood nightmare to become shadows in the waking world. \"Is there anything else?\" Marie asked quietly.Now it was Josephs turn to look back at the party coming out of the forest, which were now carrying a man by his hands and feet on a pole, his mouth gagged and his eyes blindfolded. \"Only that they also sent you a sacrifice. From what they said, hes a drug-runner, sexual slaver and a general bad example of low-level underworld scum.\"Marie, still in shock over the news of the murders, was perhaps not picking and choosing the words coming out of her mouth. \"Which mean hes gonna taste worse than the fish sauce.\"At these words, both gruesome and almost ridiculous, both her lover and her friend goggled at her.", "The ShoggothI had met Professor Kindle during my explorations in my youth in Berlin at a convention. His theories in such subjects as physics and anatomy were peculiar to me-and to his chagrin-his colleges as well.\"Well, my boy,\" He said upon my asking why everyone seemed to mock him. \"These fools do not wish to see whats so plain that if it were a snake, it would most assuredly bite them.\"Upon that introduction, he had began to tell me how certain miniscule particles held the universe together. What he said went beyond dark matter and such unexplained universal secrets that it was almost hard to believe. But I can tell you, he was convincing. A fact that will later cause me to rethink my pursuits.\"You see, my boy, Yog-Sothoth particles and Azathoth particles exist in sub matter, in a way that can go undetected even more so than the elusive dark matter for it obviously does not refract or twist light in any such matter like anything else in space.\"\"Then how does one know of their existence?\" I asked, and for the fourth time: \"And why those names?\"It was odd to me to think that such a thing would exist that does not interact upon its surroundings. And what was queer was that the names did not follow the standard scientific tradition of Latin roots; instead appearing to be from some alien language.He smiled. \"Come, my boy, I shall show you.\" He draped an arm over my shoulders. \"And as for the names; they are from the Necromicon. A book I doubt you have read, but the names fit, believe me. For you see, Azathoth represents chaos, and Yog-Sothoth order; its like the Chinese philosophy of Yin and Yang, a philosophy I find as very true.\"Kindle took me to his hotel room where he produced from a brown briefcase, a telescope. It looked like any telescope that one could easily obtain from any store for cheap. Yet, something was off. A minor defect, yet hardly noticeable except in the right light. There was an angle of odd proportions etched out of glass and sealed within between the two lenses.\"Look, look.\" He said excitedly.I did look. And what I saw amazed me more than frightened me; as many introductory things do. What appeared to be bubbles and globular orbs of wiggling ganglia-like tentacles were stuck together. I took my eye away.\"And how do you know it keeps the universe together?\"\"It goes in a straight line across the sky.\" He said. \"Granted, its mere speculation, but I believe it to be correct, for, how many things are a perfect line in a vacuum?\"I was unable to disagree.After that, our interactions consisted of an odd letter or two. I became a physician and he became a recluse due to his latest published work that was about his Azathoth and Yog-Sothoth particles. He would only ever briefly say what he was working on. I guess he thought me a fellow conspirator, a rebel to the newly founded scientific idea; anything out of the norm is false, to the point he sent me a battered copy of the Necromicon.I read the book, horrified at what I was reading, that I am still surprised that I did not throw it to the floor and burn it. But the next letter just asked a question:Did you read it?I replied in the positive and the next response was an invitation to his little house in the sparsely populated hills of New England. I will not tell of my travels to his one story house that surprised me that such a man would live there.It was a dilapidated house that looked like time and hillbilly inhabitants before him had a wild party, trashing it beyond any sense of repairing it. When I knocked on the door and my friend opened it, I was greeted with the sight of the inside, which appeared only slightly better than the outside. The wallpaper was peeling, everything was dusty, and the lights were working, yet did not seem to help alleviate the gloom that seemed to settle upon the house in a death grip.\"Ah, its so good to see you, my boy.\" He greeted me, allowing me into the house. \"Come, please sit. I have some tea prepared for your arrival.\"I take the offered liquid and he sits on the armchair across from me. He takes a sip of his tea before setting it down upon the arm of his chair, his finger never leaving the handle.\"I invited you here to see my newest discovery.\" He said, an intense look aimed at me. Like an excited madman holding a gun.\"What is it?\"\"Shoggoths,\"He said that one word, never explaining anything, letting the dreadful word sink into my mind.\"Granted,\" He took another sip. \"I didnt discover them. But there was something that eluded me. A phrase; anyone could over look it, but I didnt. Tekeli-li.\" He almost mimicked a robot.My face turned pale at that word. Instinctual fear ingrown and nearly forgotten, left burrowed into a level of subconscious was unearthed and made me want to run faster than I have ever ran in my entire life. I knew I should have listened to it, but curiosity had gotten the better of me.\"The purpose behind it,\" Kindle continued as if there were no tension in the air. \"Eluded me. Until I started thinking in terms of wolves. Theyre very much alike, you know. Sleek killing machines with a high intelligence(though to-say-Cthulhu or Azathoth, they are stupid).\"With an interesting way to communicate.\" He smirked. \"I was proven correct by mere chance. I spied a shoggoth all alone. It cried out Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li! Another cried out in response, but this one angrier. The first spoke out and went about doing chores.\"\"Thats interesting, Kindle.\" I said. \"But how does this have to do with wolves? They howl to alert members of their pack of their location.\"\"Yes,\" Kindle said matter-of-factly. \"But wolves also have growls and other vocal ways of communicating. Shoggoths only have the one word. And to prove it, I took two Shoggoths and placed them in something similar to a rat maze.\"\"But how did you catch them?\"\"Doesnt matter.\" He snapped. \"Now let me finish, my friend.\"\"One called out and the other started to move and call out as well. This continued until they found each other. It wasnt until I caught more that I made the most startling information about them.\"My body trembles. I can only imagine what else he could have discovered about those loathsome creatures.\"I had caught six or seven of them. I crammed them into this one room below this house. It was getting cramped in there for them, so these two decided to fuse together. And it hit me! Theyre fragments! Their hive mind-like behavior, their similarities. Everything!\"\"Come, Ill show you.\"\"No,\" I snap, standing. \"Id rather not.\"Kindle becomes angered by my outburst. He grabs my arm tightly and tries to drag me towards the cellar, but I resist.\"Come, come, there is nothing to be afraid of.\"\"There is.\" I said. \"Shoggoths…\"I was cut off by a loud thunder from under our feet. Kindle pales as it happens again. He breaks from my arm and tries to run into the kitchen but he never makes it. A long, large, slimy black tentacle rises from the hole it made in the floor. I notice in sick fascination that a black, tar-like substance drips off of it. It darts towards the sound of Kindles running feet and wraps around his leg, forcing him to land, face first, onto the floor.I watch, dumb, as it drags my friend towards the hole. Kindle screams and begs me to help him, but I dont move. Fear plagues me, cementing my feet to the wood floor. It is not until his struggling form sinks into the hole that my feet can work again and I dart out of the house.Tekeli-li!(1)AAAhhhhhhhh!(1)1) These were larger(font 22), but the site messes with me!Mantineus-The ending is ambiguous by default. You see, our hero makes it out. What you see is The Shuggoth and Kindles dying scream."]}
{"id": "EN024", "pair": ["That is the end of the story, dear readers. Believe me or not, I dont care. I ran far away from the university that evening and, to this day, I have never returned. I had to have my arm amputated after that and my burned and mangled body remains as testament to the evil I have encountered. I told the authorities it was a college fire. What else could I say?I cannot sleep well anymore. Every night I lie awake, shaking in fear in the knowledge of what exists beyond the limited scope of what we call \"reality\". What is reality? I dont know. All I do know is that this world contains more evil than can ever be imagined.The evil of the Cult of Cthulhu is still out there and I know that my days are numbered. I have seen too much. One day they will come for me and, when they do, I will let them take me. I have tried to end my life a number of times and now reside in an asylum as a result. Death will come as a relief for me.It has taken me a great deal of effort to write this, since every fibre of my being has tried to block out the memories of what happened at that university. But I need you to know. I need you to be prepared. The Cult of Cthulhu is alive and well and, one day, Cthulhu will rise and destroy this planet. It is only a matter of time.Darkness.I didnt know who I was or where I was. All I could tell was that I was falling lower and lower into a deep oblivion of blackness.Though I was unafraid.Was I dead?It didnt matter.In that place, nothing mattered.I was at peace.And then I was jerked roughly back into reality, though reality had become so distorted in my mind that I could scarcely tell the difference between what was real and what was fantasy. The first thing that I became aware of was a searing pain across my abdomen. I tried to scream, but my throat was sore as though I had been screaming for hours already. I attempted to move my arms but they were locked in place and I realised to my horror that the pain was from ropes that had been tied around me so tightly that they were literally cutting into my flesh. I spluttered for a moment as the sights and sounds of the world started to come back to me. I was tied upside down to the obelisk in the centre of the ritual space I had seen the previous night and my worst fears were realised.I was covered in blood, though whether it was my own or that of another unfortunate victim I couldnt tell. A fire surrounded me and on the other side of the flames, people in black robes were dancing wildly making noises that sounded neither human nor beastly. I began to wonder why I was still alive and why I had not been dismembered like Jonathan.Then one of the participants stepped through the flames, emerging unharmed beside me. He brandished a long silver knife and screamed \"Cthulhu Fhtagn!\" at the heavens. The figure turned down to look at me. It was Jacob, though it wasnt Jacobs eyes that looked at me, rather an empty, soulless shell of a human being. He raised the knife and I began to pray silently, expecting the end. Though it wasnt me he plunged the knife into, it was himself. He rammed the blade up to the hilt into his stomach and violently jerked it upwards, sending gory sprays of arterial blood all over my face and into my mouth and nose. Jacob then reached into his chest and began to pull out his internal organs, laughing maniacally as he did so. It was then that I found my voice and screamed louder than I had ever done, though my cries were drowned out by the diabolical beat of the drums and the bestial chants of the other cultists.Jacob did not fall to the ground as anyone else would have done. Instead, he cracked open his ribcage, revealing his empty chest cavity. An unseen force then ripped his head back, nearly severing it, his spine bent backwards and cracked and then his limbs began bending into odd angles as well. All the while, he continued in his demonic laughter, the chants of the cultists and the beat of the drums growing and growing. He contorted spasmodically, and shadowy tendrils sprung out of his body, twisting as they reached up to the sky. Suddenly, Jacobs body exploded in a shower of blood and offal although his ghoulish laugh seemed to continue somehow, and out of nowhere appeared many small winged creatures. They were less than three feet in height and completely black. No detail of their bodies was visible save for a pair of glowing green eyes. They swooped around the obelisk to which I was tied, uttering a shrieking sound unlike anything I had ever heard. As they shrieked, the dancing, chanting and beating of the drums got louder and wilder until, at its climax, the ground itself started rumbling. Cracks started to appear in the ground and water started gushing out causing the obelisk to crumble, but the fire burned ever brighter.Due to the destruction of the obelisk, the bonds that were around my middle loosened slightly. But as I tried to rise, I was violently pushed down into the water by one of the cultists who cried,\"Mighty Cthulhu! Accept our sacrifice of blood and rise again!\" With that he drew a knife of his own, but before he was able to end my existence, one of the shadowy winged creatures flew into his chest, disappearing in an instant. Suddenly, the cultists eyes literally burst into flames and he began reciting the chant I had heard so many times: \"Cthulhu Fhtagn! Cthulhu Fhtagn!\" His mouth then opened wide and I could hear his jaw bone break. Long teeth extended from the gums and before I could react, he lurched forward sinking them into my forearm.This new pain was just what I needed. I screamed in agony and ripped free. Quickly loosening the bonds around me, I leapt through the fire. Its searing heat scorched me and I felt as though a thousand knives were simultaneously being plunged into my skin. I looked desperately around for an opening to escape and noticed that all the cultists now had flaming eyes and were running at me screaming even as their heads burned in the flames from their eyes. I turned and fled, not caring about the pain in my arm or the fire that was rapidly consuming me. Not caring about the thorns and branches that eviscerated me as I ran past them. I knew I just needed to get as far away as possible.Although the screams of the ritual participants had begun to fade, I did not slow down. I just kept going and did not look back.", "The Judas Mark\"Cthulhu ftaghn,\" He said with a laugh, swaying his tilted head to the right in a drunken manner. \"Cthulhu ftaghn.\"He broke out into a laughing fit. Then as quickly as it started it stopped; like the lightning bolt outside his window. Arkham was his place of work. And as a patient, his work was hard to complete. Not like he wanted to do it, either.The rain stopped.\"I hear youuuuuuu.\" He chuckled. \"I hear you flapping those blasted wings outside my windah.\" He giggled, then sobered up. \"Damn Migo. YA CANT HAVE MY BRAIN!\"There came a drum of plastic on metal as his attention was drawn to the orderly with a plastic flashlight. Aforementioned light shining into his padded room.\"Keep it down in there!\" The orderly snapped before leaving him alone once again.\"Power outage, eh?\" He chuckled. \"Wonder whyyyy.\"He rolled his head back to his right; towards his window. His eyes registered the sound of unearthly wings twitching like insects contemplating flight. Oh how he hated those damn things. Far worse than those Shoggoths he faced a while back. At least the Shoggoths ate you; thus ending your torment. But a Migo…He shuttered. He did not want to think about it.\"Nyarlahotep…You son of a bitch.\" He said, looking grumpy, then broke out in hysterics, then going back as if it never happened. \"If it werent for you…Id be…Id be…\"Where would he be? In his mind, he saw himself in Miami, laying on the beach with Lucinda, their two kids playing in the sand as the waves crashed soothingly onto the shore. But then his logic would kick that to the curb. Lucinda was showing signs…She would have dumped him if it werent for that Deep One, that is, dragging her-kicking and screaming-to the bottom of the sea.He would be away from his insane parents. That insane town of Dunwich. Even if Lucinda did not accompany him, he would, at least, be free from here. But then he met him.\"Jesus…\"\"Yes?\" Came a sweet, velvety voice. A voice one would hear from royalty.\"Not you.\" He snapped.\"But I am him.\" A hand placed itself on his shoulder as the entire figure appeared, sitting beside him like they were best friends.\"No...Youre the fucking antichrist.\"\"Is there really a difference in that either?\" Jesus asked, a smirk gracing his regal, black lips. \"Both promise paradise. From there, its on a persons opinion on what that is.\" He chuckled. \"And do not tell me that you forgot your title, Ivan…Or should I say Judas?\"\"THEN WHY PLACE ME HERE?\" Ivan shouted.\"Hey!\" The orderly shouted, banging his flashlight on the bars again. \"What did I just say?\"The orderlys face began to bubble. His flesh boiled, broken screams erupted from his face. He collapsed and scratched at his face, letting more and more blood poor onto the floor.\"I hate interruptions.\" Jesus said. \"And as for your answer…Because. If Jesus was as all powerful as he claimed, why did he allow Judas to stay in the fold? Why did he allow the lowly wretches hope? Why did I command Tython to drag Lucinda down to the depths to suffer being rendered by hungry maws before she could drown?\"He smirked evilly as he described Lucindas gruesome demise. Ivan panted heavily, his rage rising faster than Rlyeh ever would to the surface. Ivan struck thin air as his body moved too slow for the deity; whom was already standing, laughing at the mortal.\"Because theres more to it, Judas.\" Jesus said. \"Judas of old was an important player in the world. The wretches were a growing populace, if they loved him, they would worship him.\"\"Bullshit!\" He spat.\"Is it?\"\"We want you to betray us, Judas.\" Jesus said after his question was ignored.\"Why?\"\"Sorry, but us Christs keep some secrets from their disciples.\"\"What makes you Jesus?\"\"Our roles.\" He stated simply. \"You see…He was supposed to preach about us. But, sadly, his mind couldnt take it. So Cthulhu became a god. Not like it matters, religion changes all the time.\"He smirked, all knowing. \"And no, he wasnt the son of Cthulhu. That was my little trick.\"\"Pray Judas,\" He said from behind Ivan-not allowing him to speak-his black, decaying lips mere inches from his ear. \"He likes that. It makes him feel powerful.\"\"No,\" Ivan said. \"I shall not ya damned bastard! And I wont bring about their reawakening! These crazies will remain sedated!\"Jesus laughed.\"Thats my cue.\"Jesus grabbed Ivan by the neck and slammed his body against the wall. Buzzing from outside the window grew from a silent drone into a frenzy. Jesus smirked evilly, drawing his face closer to his Judas.\"In blood the mark is drawn.\"Nyarlahotep drew the blade he was hiding and slashed Ivans wrist, splattering drops of blood on the wall. He watched in delight as the drops spread, several linking up and continuing their intricate design.It consisted of a crude circle with intertwining tentacles and a pair of piercing eyes.\"There,\" He said. \"Done.\"He tossed Ivan. He landed next to the window and as he peered out of it he clearly saw the glowing heads and beating wings of the Migo, their forms slightly covered by the rain that began to fall again.\"Enjoy your trip, Judas.\" Nyarlahotep said. \"For though I am done with you, you still serve a purpose.\"The Migo swarmed, the window shattering like paper. Ivan barely had time to scream as they worked on his skull, amputating his brain and placing it inside their jar.\"Cthulhu ftagn, indeed.\""]}
{"id": "EN033", "pair": ["Dry hacking. The sound assaults my ears, and makes my heart begin to flutter. Its unlike any paroxysm Ive ever heard, even when Theodora contracted pneumonia two years ago. Whats far worse is I know, instinctively, that it is not she whose body is wracked with illness. Its Lemuel Dawson, on his deathbed.\"Hold on!\" My voice is lighter, younger, not yet burdened with the weight of sorrow after his passing. Like any good nurse, I rush to his side and wipe the bloody spittle from his lips with a handkerchief. This is no mere dream; its a recollection, and thats exactly what I did back then. \"Im here as always, Father.\" \"Millie,\" he says weakly, and smiles through the pain of nearly-constant coughing. \"Come closer.\" I do, and wince at his fevered breath. \"Theres something that I must tell you, at long last.\" Every word of his is belabored. His voice reminds me of a desert wind, scorched with sand. Even his sickroom has that acrid air, as if we were in the middle of the Sahara instead of Massachusetts. I myself am hot, and know Father must be. However, I dare not leave his chamber to fetch a wet cloth for fear of missing his last words.\"They have come for me, and…you must know all that I do before they come for you. Find the keys,\" he says before being consumed with another coughing fit, \"in the bottom drawer of my desk. Bring them here.\" Again I follow his directions, yet hesitantly. Throughout his life, Father had been very particular about who was allowed to touch his personal possessions, and rummage through his desks and cabinets. Even our taciturn Theodora, whod never reveal any of his secrets even under duress, was forbidden from doing so. Father gave explicit instructions on which rooms were to be cleaned (kitchen, parlor, and so on), and which were not (his spartan bedroom after Mother died, and private study). Thats why it puzzles me, in this nighttime vision as well as in life, to hear him make such a request. Nevertheless, I hurry to obey it.It takes several tugs of the aforementioned bottom drawer, sticky with disuse, to get it to yield. When it does, I cough at the dust within and pull out a small iron ring with five keys. Each one of them is different, as keys naturally are, yet these five have been bent into the most curious shapes and configurations. Im tempted to stand beside the desk and stare at them to my hearts content, fingering their bizarre metal shafts, but Fathers waiting. Not knowing what hell tell me, or what he wants me to do with the keys, I take them over to his bedside. Greedily, he grasps them in his long fingers and takes my right hand in his.\"First,\" he announces, slipping one of the unique keys into my palm. \"Second,\" he then says, doing the same with another. \"Third. Closet. Church.\" With sudden horror, I realize what they open: the three locks to the door of his forbidden study, the closet within it, and the only church to which hes ever belonged. \"The one on Gallows Hill,\" he clarifies. I wonder why hes called it that instead of Cemetery Hill. Perhaps, now that hes facing his own hangman in the form of an illness that not even Leights doctor can diagnose, images of the Purge are haunting him. \"Read and learn all you can, when youre prepared. Take care.\" I couldnt stop myself: \"Why take care? Is something wrong? Who are they, Father? Please explain!\" \"It would take…too long.\" He slowly smiles, exposing all of his teeth in the white rictus of a deaths-head. Pressing the keys so firmly into my palm that they leave mild scrapes and indentations afterward, Father coughs once more. \"Believe.\" With that, his withered hand releases mine and falls to his side limply. He is no longer alive, and our conversation has drained me so much that I can do nothing but sob in fright.I wake up to find my pillow damp, and my eyes glistening. There is no one around save for me, and the all-encompassing darkness to hide my tears. Its been seventeen years, almost to the day, since Lemuel Dawson departed this mortal world. I feel ashamed of myself, because after nearly two decades, I should not be so stricken with grief. Father, at this point in time, should be a distant memory, a framed portrait on the wall of my house and mind. However, he is not. He has evidently remained with me, in a locked compartment of my mental faculties that only dreams can reopen. Why now? Why here, in this very Inn? If the keys that he gave me so long ago - and which Ive reconfined to the drawer from which I took them - are back in his old house, then why didnt I dream about them back there? This is too strange, and scary.When youre prepared, Father had told me, read and learn all you can. Prepared for what, I wonder?", "Theres nothing much of interest in the lobby: three striped armchairs (one of which has an upholstered arm thats coming unsewn), two tables, a crackling fireplace, and a wrought-iron chandelier. It would behoove Mr. Thènard to tell his servant to dust the cobwebs off of it, and perhaps place some books on the tables. Knowing Agathe, however, she sticks to her duties, and doesnt like to be told anything that she considers superfluous. Ive seen her at the Dreamers Inn since I was a girl, but have always avoided her. Im relieved to see no sign of the crone in the empty dining room, which I pass on the way to the stairs.Even when she was younger by twenty-seven years, Agathes presence was a fearsome one. At fifty, she already appeared to be a quarter century older than that. With eyes that were nearly onyx, narrowed into perpetual slits, she terrified me and unnerved Father. \"I wish I could dismiss her,\" he hissed into my ear when I was only seven, \"but shes served here at the Inn since your grandfathers time. It wouldnt be fair. Without her wages here, shed surely starve.\" Back then, I didnt think that Agathe required much to eat, with a gaunt frame that reminded me of a skeleton in a maids dress. Her hair, brown then and gray now, is pulled back tightly into an impeccable bun. She performs her daily tasks in complete silence, or did so in my tender years, and glared at you malevolently if you so much as looked her way. Hate seemed to dart from her bottomless pupils directly into your soul, and from that moment you learned to leave her alone.Shes not here, Millicent, I tell myself as I slowly ascend the stairs. Shes up in her room. Youre safe now. Still, I cling to the wall tightly and hold my breath as I reach the second floor. The door to my room stands before me, closed and locked, and bearing a brass 2 as the symbol of my destination. I know that behind that door lies safety, and I find myself darting toward it like a hunted rabbit. I jam Monsieur Thénards key into the lock with a hard jolt, too loud for my sepulchral surroundings, and give it a frightened twist. It takes all my power of self-restraint not to slam the door behind me once it opens, so as to ward off a sudden appearance of Agathe. Besides, I have to turn on the gas lamp. The room is suddenly illuminated, almost warmly, and I smile as I behold a quilted bed. Above it is a diamond-paned window, black as pitch, and next to me is a writing desk. Locking the door and double-bolting it for the night, I sit down at the latter.Theres nothing on the worn and scuffed top of it but a copy of the Holy Bible. More out of boredom than piety, I open it to a certain random point past the middle. Romans 6:23 immediately catches my eye:\"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.\" Eternal life? Why would I want such a thing, when even this temporal one of mine is pointless? Day after day, I yearn for company and occupation, yet I cant even get a position as a charwoman here in Leight. Not that Id want to be a drudge, but one would think I could at least teach or give piano lessons. No one will trust me with their own confidence, however, let alone the welfare of their children. I am not a godly woman by any means, which brings me to the second page to which I suddenly turned - Romans 3:23:\"For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God.\" Do I not know it? Are the powers that be, whether the Trinity or other spirits, unaware of the iniquity I bear? Not only do I carry the burden of my mistakes and wrongdoings, but those of my errant forefathers. I cannot say whether Abner Dawes, the man who built the Dreamers Inn with his own hands, was Satans thrall or not. Nevertheless, even after Grandfathers changing our family surname from Dawes to Dawson, the stigma of our bloodline has remained. One might ask why this is so, when other people here in Leight whose kin were hanged during the Purge have had their black marks washed away. The answer is simple: they turned to Christ, and all of their feuding churches, while we Dawsons kept our faith to ourselves.Hoping for a glimmer of salvation in the Holy Books pages, I unconsciously turn to one more passage:\"And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment.\" Hebrews 9:27Sighing, I undress for bed and climb beneath the quilt. I straightway fall into slumber, and begin to dream."]}
{"id": "EN028", "pair": ["III. A Search and an Evocation1.Charles Ward, as we have seen, first learned in 1918 of his descent from Joseph Curwen. That he at once took an intense interest in everything pertaining to the bygone mystery is not to be wondered at; for every vague rumour that he had heard of Curwen now became something vital to himself, in whom flowed Curwens blood. No spirited and imaginative genealogist could have done otherwise than begin forthwith an avid and systematic collection of Curwen data.      In his first delvings there was not the slightest attempt at secrecy; so that even Dr. Lyman hesitates to date the youths madness from any period before the close of 1919. He talked freely with his family - though his mother was not particularly pleased to own an ancestor like Curwen - and with the officials of the various museums and libraries he visited. In applying to private families for records thought to be in their possession he made no concealment of his object, and shared the somewhat amused scepticism with which the accounts of the old diarists and letter-writers were regarded. He often expressed a keen wonder as to what really had taken place a century and a half before at that Pawtuxet farmhouse whose site he vainly tried to find, and what Joseph Curwen really had been.      When he came across the Smith diary and archives and encountered the letter from Jedediah Orne he decided to visit Salem and look up Curwens early activities and connexions there, which he did during the Easter vacation of 1919. At the Essex Institute, which was well known to him from former sojourns in the glamorous old town of crumbling Puritan gables and clustered gambrel roofs, he was very kindly received, and unearthed there a considerable amount of Curwen data. He found that his ancestor was born in Salem-Village, now Danvers, seven miles from town, on the eighteenth of February (O.S.) 1662-3; and that he had run away to sea at the age of fifteen, not appearing again for nine years, when he returned with the speech, dress, and manners of a native Englishman and settled in Salem proper. At that time he had little to do with his family, but spent most of his hours with the curious books he had brought from Europe, and the strange chemicals which came for him on ships from England, France, and Holland. Certain trips of his into the country were the objects of much local inquisitiveness, and were whisperingly associated with vague rumours of fires on the hills at night.      Curwens only close friends had been one Edward Hutchinson of Salem-Village and one Simon Orne of Salem. With these men he was often seen in conference about the Common, and visits among them were by no means infrequent. Hutchinson had a house well out toward the woods, and it was not altogether liked by sensitive people because of the sounds heard there at night. He was said to entertain strange visitors, and the lights seen from his windows were not always of the same colour. The knowledge he displayed concerning long-dead persons and long-forgotten events was considered distinctly unwholesome, and he disappeared about the time the witchcraft panic began, never to be heard from again. At that time Joseph Curwen also departed, but his settlement in Providence was soon learned of. Simon Orne lived in Salem until 1720, when his failure to grow visibly old began to excite attention. He thereafter disappeared, though thirty years later his precise counterpart and self-styled son turned up to claim his property. The claim was allowed on the strength of documents in Simon Ornes known hand, and Jedediah Orne continued to dwell in Salem till 1771, when certain letters from Providence citizens to the Rev. Thomas Barnard and others brought about his quiet removal to parts unknown.      Certain documents by and about all of these strange characters were available at the Essex Institute, the Court House, and the Registry of Deeds, and included both harmless commonplaces such as land titles and bills of sale, and furtive fragments of a more provocative nature. There were four or five unmistakable allusions to them on the witchcraft trial records; as when one Hepzibah Lawson swore on July 10, 1692, at the Court of Oyer and Terminer under Judge Hathorne, that fortie Witches and the Blacke Man were wont to meete in the Woodes behind Mr. Hutchinsons house, and one Amity How declared at a session of August 8th before Judge Gedney that Mr. G. B. (Rev. George Burroughs) on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B. Then there was a catalogue of Hutchinsons uncanny library as found after his disappearance, and an unfinished manuscript in his handwriting, couched in a cipher none could read. Ward had a photostatic copy of this manuscript made, and began to work casually on the cipher as soon as it was delivered to him. After the following August his labours on the cipher became intense and feverish, and there is reason to believe from his speech and conduct that he hit upon the key before October or November. He never stated, though, whether or not he had succeeded.      But of the greatest immediate interest was the Orne material. It took Ward only a short time to prove from identity of penmanship a thing he had already considered established from the text of the letter to Curwen; namely, that Simon Orne and his supposed son were one and the same person. As Orne had said to his correspondent, it was hardly safe to live too long in Salem, hence he resorted to a thirty-year sojourn abroad, and did not return to claim his lands except as a representative of a new generation. Orne had apparently been careful to destroy most of his correspondence, but the citizens who took action in 1771 found and preserved a few letters and papers which excited their wonder. There were cryptic formulae and diagrams in his and other hands which Ward now either copied with care or had photographed, and one extremely mysterious letter in a chirography that the searcher recognised from items in the Registry of Deeds as positively Joseph Curwens.      This Curwen letter, though undated as to the year, was evidently not the one in answer to which Orne had written the confiscated missive; and from internal evidence Ward placed it not much later than 1750. It may not be amiss to give the text in full, as a sample of the style of one whose history was so dark and terrible. The recipient is addressed as \"Simon\", but a line (whether drawn by Curwen or Orne Ward could not tell) is run through the word.Prouidence, I.

This letter, oddly enough, was what first gave Ward the exact location of Curwens Providence home; for none of the records encountered up to that time had been at all specific. The discovery was doubly striking because it indicated as the newer Curwen house built in 1761 on the site of the old, a dilapidated building still standing in Olney Court and well known to Ward in his antiquarian rambles over Stampers Hill. The place was indeed only a few squares from his own home on the great hills higher ground, and was now the abode of a negro family much esteemed for occasional washing, housecleaning, and furnace-tending services. To find, in distant Salem, such sudden proof of the significance of this familiar rookery in his own family history, was a highly impressive thing to Ward; and he resolved to explore the place immediately upon his return. The more mystical phases of the letter, which he took to be some extravagant kind of symbolism, frankly baffled him; though he noted with a thrill of curiosity that the Biblical passage referred to - Job 14, 14 - was the familiar verse, \"If a man die, shall he live again? All the days of my appointed time will I wait, till my change come.\"2.      Young Ward came home in a state of pleasant excitement, and spent the following Saturday in a long and exhaustive study of the house in Olney Court. The place, now crumbling with age, had never been a mansion; but was a modest two-and-a-half story wooden town house of the familiar Providence colonial type, with plain peaked roof, large central chimney, and artistically carved doorway with rayed fanlight, triangular pediment, and trim Doric pilasters. It had suffered but little alteration externally, and Ward felt he was gazing on something very close to the sinister matters of his quest.      The present negro inhabitants were known to him, and he was very courteously shewn about the interior by old Asa and his stout wife Hannah. Here there was more change than the outside indicated, and Ward saw with regret that fully half of the fine scroll-and-urn overmantels and shell-carved cupboard linings were gone, whilst much of the fine wainscotting and bolection moulding was marked, hacked, and gouged, or covered up altogether with cheap wall-paper. In general, the survey did not yield as much as Ward had somehow expected; but it was at least exciting to stand within the ancestral walls which had housed such a man of horror as Joseph Curwen. He saw with a thrill that a monogram had been very carefully effaced from the ancient brass knocker.      From then until after the close of school Ward spent his time on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher and the accumulation of local Curwen data. The former still proved unyielding; but of the latter he obtained so much, and so many clues to similar data elsewhere, that he was ready by July to make a trip to New London and New York to consult old letters whose presence in those places was indicated. This trip was very fruitful, for it brought him the Fenner letters with their terrible description of the Pawtuxet farmhouse raid, and the Nightingale-Talbot letters in which he learned of the portrait painted on a panel of the Curwen library. This matter of the portrait interested him particularly, since he would have given much to know just what Joseph Curwen looked like; and he decided to make a second search of the house in Olney Court to see if there might not be some trace of the ancient features beneath peeling coats of later paint or layers of mouldy wall-paper.      Early in August that search took place, and Ward went carefully over the walls of every room sizeable enough to have been by any possibility the library of the evil builder. He paid especial attention to the large panels of such overmantels as still remained; and was keenly excited after about an hour, when on a broad area above the fireplace in a spacious ground-floor room he became certain that the surface brought out by the peeling of several coats of paint was sensibly darker than any ordinary interior paint or the wood beneath it was likely to have been. A few more careful tests with a thin knife, and he knew that he had come upon an oil portrait of great extent. With truly scholarly restraint the youth did not risk the damage which an immediate attempt to uncover the hidden picture with the knife might have done, but just retired from the scene of his discovery to enlist expert help. In three days he returned with an artist of long experience, Mr. Walter C. Dwight, whose studio is near the foot of College Hill; and that accomplished restorer of paintings set to work at once with proper methods and chemical substances. Old Asa and his wife were duly excited over their strange visitors, and were properly reimbursed for this invasion of their domestic hearth.      As day by day the work of restoration progressed, Charles Ward looked on with growing interest at the lines and shades gradually unveiled after their long oblivion. Dwight had begun at the bottom; hence since the picture was a three-quarter-length one, the face did not come out for some time. It was meanwhile seen that the subject was a spare, well-shaped man with dark-blue coat, embroidered waistcoat, black satin small-clothes, and white silk stockings, seated in a carved chair against the background of a window with wharves and ships beyond. When the head came out it was observed to bear a neat Albemarle wig, and to possess a thin, calm, undistinguished face which seemed somehow familiar to both Ward and the artist. Only at the very last, though, did the restorer and his client begin to gasp with astonishment at the details of that lean, pallid visage, and to recognise with a touch of awe the dramatic trick which heredity had played. For it took the final bath of oil and the final stroke of the delicate scraper to bring out fully the expression which centuries had hidden; and to confront the bewildered Charles Dexter Ward, dweller in the past, with his own living features in the countenance of his horrible great-great-great-grandfather.      Ward brought his parents to see the marvel he had uncovered, and his father at once determined to purchase the picture despite its execution on stationary panelling. The resemblance to the boy, despite an appearance of rather greater age, was marvellous; and it could be seen that through some trick of atavism the physical contours of Joseph Curwen had found precise duplication after a century and a half. Mrs. Wards resemblance to her ancestor was not at all marked, though she could recall relatives who had some of the facial characteristics shared by her son and by the bygone Curwen. She did not relish the discovery, and told her husband that he had better burn the picture instead of bringing it home. There was, she averred, something unwholesome about it; not only intrinsically, but in its very resemblance to Charles. Mr. Ward, however, was a practical man of power and affairs - a cotton manufacturer with extensive mills at Riverpoint in the Pawtuxet Valley - and not one to listen to feminine scruples. The picture impressed him mightily with its likeness to his son, and he believed the boy deserved it as a present. In this opinion, it is needless to say, Charles most heartily concurred; and a few days later Mr. Ward located the owner of the house - a small rodent-featured person with a guttural accent - and obtained the whole mantel and overmantel bearing the picture at a curtly fixed priced which cut short the impending torrent of unctuous haggling.      It now remained to take off the panelling and remove it to the Ward home, where provisions were made for its thorough restoration and installation with an electric mock-fireplace in Charless third-floor study or library. To Charles was left the task of superintending this removal, and on the twenty-eighth of August he accompanied two expert workmen from the Crooker decorating firm to the house in Olney Court, where the mantel and portrait-bearing overmantel were detached with great care and precision for transportation in the companys motor truck. There was left a space of exposed brickwork marking the chimneys course, and in this young Ward observed a cubical recess about a foot square, which must have lain directly behind the head of the portrait. Curious as to what such a space might mean or contain, the youth approached and looked within; finding beneath the deep coatings of dust and soot some loose yellowed papers, a crude, thick copybook, and a few mouldering textile shreds which may have formed the ribbon binding the rest together. Blowing away the bulk of the dirt and cinders, he took up the book and looked at the bold inscription on its cover. It was in a hand which he had learned to recognise at the Essex Institute, and proclaimed the volume as the \"Journall and Notes of Jos: Curwen, Gent., of Providence-Plantations, Late of Salem.\"      Excited beyond measure by his discovery, Ward shewed the book to the two curious workmen beside him. Their testimony is absolute as to the nature and genuineness of the finding, and Dr. Willett relies on them to help establish his theory that the youth was not mad when he began his major eccentricities. All the other papers were likewise in Curwens handwriting, and one of them seemed especially portentous because of its inscription: \"To Him Who Shal Come After, & How He May Gett Beyonde Time & ye Spheres.\" Another was in a cipher; the same, Ward hoped, as the Hutchinson cipher which had hitherto baffled him. A third, and here the searcher rejoiced, seemed to be a key to the cipher; whilst the fourth and fifth were addressed respectively to \"Edw: Hutchinson, Armiger\" and \"Jedediah Orne, Esq.\", or Their Heir or Heirs, or Those Representg Them. The sixth and last was inscribed: \"Joseph Curwen his Life and Travells Betn ye yeares 1678 and 1687: Of Whither He Voyagd, Where He Stayd, Whom He Sawe, and What He Learnt.\"3.      We have now reached the point from which the more academic school of alienists date Charles Wards madness. Upon his discovery the youth had looked immediately at a few of the inner pages of the book and manuscripts, and had evidently seen something which impressed him tremendously. Indeed, in shewing the titles to the workmen he appeared to guard the text itself with peculiar care, and to labour under a perturbation for which even the antiquarian and genealogical significance of the find could hardly account. Upon returning home he broke the news with an almost embarrassed air, as if he wished to convey an idea of its supreme importance without having to exhibit the evidence itself. He did not even shew the titles to his parents, but simply told them that he had found some documents in Joseph Curwens handwriting, \"mostly in cipher\", which would have to be studied very carefully before yielding up their true meaning. It is unlikely that he would have shewn what he did to the workmen, had it not been for their unconcealed curiosity. As it was he doubtless wished to avoid any display of peculiar reticence which would increase their discussion of the matter.      That night Charles Ward sat up in his room reading the new-found book and papers, and when day came he did not desist. His meals, on his urgent request when his mother called to see what was amiss, were sent up to him; and in the afternoon he appeared only briefly when the men came to install the Curwen picture and mantelpiece in his study. The next night he slept in snatches in his clothes, meanwhile wrestling feverishly with the unravelling of the cipher manuscript. In the morning his mother saw that he was at work on the photostatic copy of the Hutchinson cipher, which he had frequently shewn her before; but in response to her query he said that the Curwen key could not be applied to it. That afternoon he abandoned his work and watched the men fascinatedly as they finished their installation of the picture with its woodwork above a cleverly realistic electric log, setting the mock-fireplace and overmantel a little out from the north wall as if a chimney existed, and boxing in the sides with panelling to match the rooms. The front panel holding the picture was sawn and hinged to allow cupboard space behind it. After the workmen went he moved his work into the study and sat down before it with his eyes half on the cipher and half on the portrait which stared back at him like a year-adding and century-recalling mirror.      His parents, subsequently recalling his conduct at this period, give interesting details anent the policy of concealment which he practiced. Before servants he seldom hid any paper which he might be studying, since he rightly assumed that Curwens intricate and archaic chirography would be too much for them. With his parents, however, he was more circumspect; and unless the manuscript in question were a cipher, or a mere mass of cryptic symbols and unknown ideographs (as that entitled \"To Him Who Shal Come After etc.\" seemed to be), he would cover it with some convenient paper until his caller had departed. At night he kept the papers under lock and key in an antique cabinet of his, where he also placed them whenever he left the room. He soon resumed fairly regular hours and habits, except that his long walks and other outside interests seemed to cease. The opening of school, where he now began his senior year, seemed a great bore to him; and he frequently asserted his determination never to bother with college. He had, he said, important special investigations to make, which would provide him with more avenues toward knowledge and the humanities than any university which the world could boast.      Naturally, only one who had always been more or less studious, eccentric, and solitary could have pursued this course for many days without attracting notice. Ward, however, was constitutionally a scholar and a hermit; hence his parents were less surprised than regretful at the close confinement and secrecy he adopted. At the same time, both his father and mother thought it odd that he would shew them no scrap of his treasure-trove, nor give any connected account of such data as he had deciphered. This reticence he explained away as due to a wish to wait until he might announce some connected revelation, but as the weeks passed without further disclosures there began to grow up between the youth and his family a kind of constraint; intensified in his mothers case by her manifest disapproval of all Curwen delvings.      During October Ward began visiting the libraries again, but no longer for the antiquarian matter of his former days. Witchcraft and magic, occultism and daemonology, were what he sought now; and when Providence sources proved unfruitful he would take the train for Boston and tap the wealth of the great library in Copley Square, the Widener Library at Harvard, or the Zion Research Library in Brookline, where certain rare works on Biblical subjects are available. He bought extensively, and fitted up a whole additional set of shelves in his study for newly acquired works on uncanny subjects; while during the Christmas holidays he made a round of out-of-town trips including one to Salem to consult certain records at the Essex Institute.      About the middle of January, 1920, there entered Wards bearing an element of triumph which he did not explain, and he was no more found at work upon the Hutchinson cipher. Instead, he inaugurated a dual policy of chemical research and record-scanning; fitting up for the one a laboratory in the unused attic of the house, and for the latter haunting all the sources of vital statistics in Providence. Local dealers in drugs and scientific supplies, later questioned, gave astonishingly queer and meaningless catalogues of the substances and instruments he purchased; but clerks at the State House, the City Hall, and the various libraries agree as to the definite object of his second interest. He was searching intensely and feverishly for the grave of Joseph Curwen, from whose slate slab an older generation had so wisely blotted the name.      Little by little there grew upon the Ward family the conviction that something was wrong. Charles had had freaks and changes of minor interests before, but this growing secrecy and absorption in strange pursuits was unlike even him. His school work was the merest pretence; and although he failed in no test, it could be seen that the old application had all vanished. He had other concernments now; and when not in his new laboratory with a score of obsolete alchemical books, could be found either poring over old burial records down town or glued to his volumes of occult lore in his study, where the startlingly - one almost fancied increasingly - similar features of Joseph Curwen stared blandly at him from the great overmantel on the north wall.      Late in March Ward added to his archive-searching a ghoulish series of rambles about the various ancient cemeteries of the city. The cause appeared later, when it was learned from City Hall clerks that he had probably found an important clue. His quest had suddenly shifted from the grave of Joseph Curwen to that of one Naphthali Field; and this shift was explained when, upon going over the files that he had been over, the investigators actually found a fragmentary record of Curwens burial which had escaped the general obliteration, and which stated that the curious leaden coffin had been interred \"10 ft. S. and 5 ft. W. of Naphthali Fields grave in ye - \". The lack of a specified burying-ground in the surviving entry greatly complicated the search, and Naphthali Fields grave seemed as elusive as that of Curwen; but here no systematic effacement had existed, and one might reasonably be expected to stumble on the stone itself even if its record had perished. Hence the rambles - from which St. Johns (the former Kings) Churchyard and the ancient Congregational burying-ground in the midst of Swan Point Cemetery were excluded, since other statistics had shewn that the only Naphthali Field (obiit 1729) whose grave could have been meant had been a Baptist.4.      It was toward May when Dr. Willett, at the request of the senior Ward, and fortified with all the Curwen data which the family had gleaned from Charles in his non-secretive days, talked with the young man. The interview was of little value or conclusiveness, for Willett felt at every moment that Charles was thoroughly master of himself and in touch with matters of real importance; but it at least forced the secretive youth to offer some rational explanation of his recent demeanour. Of a pallid, impassive type not easily shewing embarrassment, Ward seemed quite ready to discuss his pursuits, though not to reveal their object. He stated that the papers of his ancestor had contained some remarkable secrets of early scientific knowledge, for the most part in cipher, of an apparent scope comparable only to the discoveries of Friar Bacon and perhaps surpassing even those. They were, however, meaningless except when correlated with a body of learning now wholly obsolete; so that their immediate presentation to a world equipped only with modern science would rob them of all impressiveness and dramatic significance. To take their vivid place in the history of human thought they must first be correlated by one familiar with the background out of which they evolved, and to this task of correlation Ward was now devoting himself. He was seeking to acquire as fast as possible those neglected arts of old which a true interpreter of the Curwen data must possess, and hoped in time to make a full announcement and presentation of the utmost interest to mankind and to the world of thought. Not even Einstein, he declared, could more profoundly revolutionise the current conception of things.      As to his graveyard search, whose object he freely admitted, but the details of whose progress he did not relate, he said he had reason to think that Joseph Curwens mutilated headstone bore certain mystic symbols - carved from directions in his will and ignorantly spared by those who had effaced the name - which were absolutely essential to the final solution of his cryptic system. Curwen, he believed, had wished to guard his secret with care; and had consequently distributed the data in an exceedingly curious fashion. When Dr. Willett asked to see the mystic documents, Ward displayed much reluctance and tried to put him off with such things as photostatic copies of the Hutchinson cipher and Orne formulae and diagrams; but finally shewed him the exteriors of some of the real Curwen finds - the \"Journall and Notes\", the cipher (title in cipher also), and the formula-filled message \"To Him Who Shal Come After\" - and let him glance inside such as were in obscure characters.      He also opened the diary at a page carefully selected for its innocuousness and gave Willett a glimpse of Curwens connected handwriting in English. The doctor noted very closely the crabbed and complicated letters, and the general aura of the seventeenth century which clung round both penmanship and style despite the writers survival into the eighteenth century, and became quickly certain that the document was genuine. The text itself was relatively trivial, and Willett recalled only a fragment:\"Wedn. 16 Octr. 1754. My Sloope the Wakeful this Day putt in from London with XX newe Men pickd up in ye Indies, Spaniards from Martineco and 2 Dutch Men from Surinam.

Simon hath not Writ these V. Weekes, but I expecte soon hearg from him.\"      When upon reaching this point Dr. Willett turned the leaf he was quickly checked by Ward, who almost snatched the book from his grasp. All that the doctor had a chance to see on the newly opened page was a brief pair of sentences; but these, strangely enough, lingered tenaciously in his memory. They ran: \"Ye Verse from Liber-Damnatus beg spoke V Roodmasses and IV Hallows-Eves, I am Hopeful ye Thing is breedg Outside ye Spheres. It will drawe One who is to Come, if I can make sure he shal bee, and he shall think on Past thinges and look back thro all ye yeares, against ye which I must have ready ye Saltes or That to make em with.\"      Willett saw no more, but somehow this small glimpse gave a new and vague terror to the painted features of Joseph Curwen which stared blandly down from the overmantel. Ever after that he entertained the odd fancy - which his medical skill of course assured him was only a fancy - that the eyes of the portrait had a sort of wish, if not an actual tendency, to follow young Charles Ward as he moved about the room. He stopped before leaving to study the picture closely, marvelling at its resemblance to Charles and memorising every minute detail of the cryptical, colourless face, even down to a slight scar or pit in the smooth brow above the right eye. Cosmo Alexander, he decided, was a painter worthy of the Scotland that produced Raeburn, and a teacher worthy of his illustrious pupil Gilbert Stuart.      Assured by the doctor that Charless mental health was in no danger, but that on the other hand he was engaged in researches which might prove of real importance, the Wards were more lenient than they might otherwise have been when during the following June the youth made positive his refusal to attend college. He had, he declared, studies of much more vital importance to pursue; and intimated a wish to go abroad the following year in order to avail himself of certain sources of data not existing in America. The senior Ward, while denying this latter wish as absurd for a boy of only eighteen, acquiesced regarding the university; so that after a none too brilliant graduation from the Moses Brown School there ensued for Charles a three-year period of intensive occult study and graveyard searching. He became recognised as an eccentric, and dropped even more completely from the sight of his familys friends than he had been before; keeping close to his work and only occasionally making trips to other cities to consult obscure records. Once he went south to talk with a strange old mulatto who dwelt in a swamp and about whom a newspaper had printed a curious article. Again he sought a small village in the Adirondacks whence reports of certain odd ceremonial practices had come. But still his parents forbade him the trip to the Old World which he desired.      Coming of age in April, 1923, and having previously inherited a small competence from his maternal grandfather, Ward determined at last to take the European trip hitherto denied him. Of his proposed itinerary he would say nothing save that the needs of his studies would carry him to many places, but he promised to write his parents fully and faithfully. When they saw he could not be dissuaded, they ceased all opposition and helped as best they could; so that in June the young man sailed for Liverpool with the farewell blessings of his father and mother, who accompanied him to Boston and waved him out of sight from the White Star pier in Charlestown. Letters soon told of his safe arrival, and of his securing good quarters in Great Russell Street, London; where he proposed to stay, shunning all family friends, till he had exhausted the resources of the British Museum in a certain direction. Of his daily life he wrote but little, for there was little to write. Study and experiment consumed all his time, and he mentioned a laboratory which he had established in one of his rooms. That he said nothing of antiquarian rambles in the glamorous old city with its luring skyline of ancient domes and steeples and its tangles of roads and alleys whose mystic convolutions and sudden vistas alternately beckon and surprise, was taken by his parents as a good index of the degree to which his new interests had engrossed his mind.      In June, 1924, a brief note told of his departure for Paris, to which he had before made one or two flying trips for material in the Bibliothque Nationale. For three months thereafter he sent only postal cards, giving an address in the Rue St. Jacques and referring to a special search among rare manuscripts in the library of an unnamed private collector. He avoided acquaintances, and no tourists brought back reports of having seen him. Then came a silence, and in October the Wards received a picture card from Prague, Czecho-Slovakia, stating that Charles was in that ancient town for the purpose of conferring with a certain very aged man supposed to be the last living possessor of some very curious mediaeval information. He gave an address in the Neustadt, and announced no move till the following January; when he dropped several cards from Vienna telling of his passage through that city on the way toward a more easterly region whither one of his correspondents and fellow-delvers into the occult had invited him.      The next card was from Klausenburg in Transylvania, and told of Wards progress toward his destination. He was going to visit a Baron Ferenczy, whose estate lay in the mountains east of Rakus; and was to be addressed at Rakus in the care of that nobleman. Another card from Rakus a week later, saying that his hosts carriage had met him and that he was leaving the village for the mountains, was his last message for a considerable time; indeed, he did not reply to his parents frequent letters until May, when he wrote to discourage the plan of his mother for a meeting in London, Paris, or Rome during the summer, when the elder Wards were planning to travel in Europe. His researches, he said, were such that he could not leave his present quarters; while the situation of Baron Ferenczys castle did not favour visits. It was on a crag in the dark wooded mountains, and the region was so shunned by the country folk that normal people could not help feeling ill at ease. Moreover, the Baron was not a person likely to appeal to correct and conservative New England gentlefolk. His aspect and manners had idiosyncrasies, and his age was so great as to be disquieting. It would be better, Charles said, if his parents would wait for his return to Providence; which could scarcely be far distant.      That return did not, however, take place until May, 1926, when after a few heralding cards the young wanderer quietly slipped into New York on the Homeric and traversed the long miles to Providence by motor-coach, eagerly drinking in the green rolling hills, the fragrant, blossoming orchards, and the white steepled towns of vernal Connecticut; his first taste of ancient New England in nearly four years. When the coach crossed the Pawcatuck and entered Rhode Island amidst the faery goldenness of a late spring afternoon his heart beat with quickened force, and the entry to Providence along Reservoir and Elmwood avenues was a breathless and wonderful thing despite the depths of forbidden lore to which he had delved. At the high square where Broad, Weybosset, and Empire Streets join, he saw before and below him in the fire of sunset the pleasant, remembered houses and domes and steeples of the old town; and his head swam curiously as the vehicle rolled down the terminal behind the Biltmore, bringing into view the great dome and soft, roof-pierced greenery of the ancient hill across the river, and the tall colonial spire of the First Baptist Church limned pink in the magic evening light against the fresh springtime verdure of its precipitous background.      Old Providence! It was this place and the mysterious forces of its long, continuous history which had brought him into being, and which had drawn him back toward marvels and secrets whose boundaries no prophet might fix. Here lay the arcana, wondrous or dreadful as the case might be, for which all his years of travel and application had been preparing him. A taxicab whirled him through Post Office Square with its glimpse of the river, the old Market House, and the head of the bay, and up the steep curved slope of Waterman Street to Prospect, where the vast gleaming dome and sunset-flushed Ionic columns of the Christian Science Church beckoned northward. Then eight squares past the fine old estates his childish eyes had known, and the quaint brick sidewalks so often trodden by his youthful feet. And at last the little white overtaken farmhouse on the right, on the left the classic Adam porch and stately bayed facade of the great brick house where he was born. It was twilight, and Charles Dexter Ward had come home.5.      A school of alienists slightly less academic than Dr. Lymans assign to Wards European trip the beginning of his true madness. Admitting that he was sane when he started, they believe that his conduct upon returning implies a disastrous change. But even to this claim Dr. Willett refuses to accede. There was, he insists, something later; and the queernesses of the youth at this stage he attributes to the practice of rituals learned abroad - odd enough things, to be sure, but by no means implying mental aberration on the part of their celebrant. Ward himself, though visibly aged and hardened, was still normal in his general reactions; and in several talks with Willett displayed a balance which no madman - even an incipient one - could feign continuously for long. What elicited the notion of insanity at this period were the sounds heard at all hours from Wards attic laboratory, in which he kept himself most of the time. There were chantings and repetitions, and thunderous declamations in uncanny rhythms; and although these sounds were always in Wards own voice, there was something in the quality of that voice, and in the accents of the formulae it pronounced, which could not but chill the blood of every hearer. It was noticed that Nig, the venerable and beloved black cat of the household, bristled and arched his back perceptibly when certain of the tones were heard.      The odours occasionally wafted from the laboratory were likewise exceedingly strange. Sometimes they were very noxious, but more often they were aromatic, with a haunting, elusive quality which seemed to have the power of inducing fantastic images. People who smelled them had a tendency to glimpse momentary mirages of enormous vistas, with strange hills or endless avenues of sphinxes and hippogriffs stretching off into infinite distance. Ward did not resume his old-time rambles, but applied himself diligently to the strange books he had brought home, and to equally strange delvings within his quarters; explaining that European sources had greatly enlarged the possibilities of his work, and promising great revelations in the years to come. His older aspect increased to a startling degree his resemblance to the Curwen portrait in his library; and Dr. Willett would often pause by the latter after a call, marvelling at the virtual identity, and reflecting that only the small pit above the pictures right eye now remained to differentiate the long-dead wizard from the living youth. These calls of Willetts, undertaken at the request of the senior Wards, were curious affairs. Ward at no time repulsed the doctor, but the latter saw that he could never reach the young mans inner psychology. Frequently he noted peculiar things about; little wax images of grotesque design on the shelves or tables, and the half-erased remnants of circles, triangles, and pentagrams in chalk or charcoal on the cleared central space of the large room. And always in the night those rhythms and incantations thundered, till it became very difficult to keep servants or suppress furtive talk of Charless madness.      In January, 1927, a peculiar incident occurred. One night about midnight, as Charles was chanting a ritual whose weird cadence echoed unpleasantly through the house below, there came a sudden gust of chill wind from the bay, and a faint, obscure trembling of the earth which everyone in the neighbourhood noted. At the same time the cat exhibited phenomenal traces of fright, while dogs bayed for as much as a mile around. This was the prelude to a sharp thunderstorm, anomalous for the season, which brought with it such a crash that Mr. and Mrs. Ward believed the house had been struck. They rushed upstairs to see what damage had been done, but Charles met them at the door to the attic; pale, resolute, and portentous, with an almost fearsome combination of triumph and seriousness on his face. He assured them that the house had not really been struck, and that the storm would soon be over. They paused, and looking through a window saw that he was indeed right; for the lightning flashed farther and farther off, whilst the trees ceased to bend in the strange frigid gust from the water. The thunder sank to a sort of dull mumbling chuckle and finally died away. Stars came out, and the stamp of triumph on Charles Wards face crystallised into a very singular expression.      For two months or more after this incident Ward was less confined than usual to his laboratory. He exhibited a curious interest in the weather, and made odd inquiries about the date of the spring thawing of the ground. One night late in March he left the house after midnight, and did not return till almost morning; when his mother, being wakeful, heard a rumbling motor draw up to the carriage entrance. Muffled oaths could be distinguished, and Mrs. Ward, rising and going to the window, saw four dark figures removing a long, heavy box from a truck at Charless direction and carrying it within by the side door. She heard laboured breathing and ponderous footfalls on the stairs, and finally a dull thumping in the attic; after which the footfalls descended again, and the four men reappeared outside and drove off in their truck.      The next day Charles resumed his strict attic seclusion, drawing down the dark shades of his laboratory windows and appearing to be working on some metal substance. He would open the door to no one, and steadfastly refused all proffered food. About noon a wrenching sound followed by a terrible cry and a fall were heard, but when Mrs. Ward rapped at the door her son at length answered faintly, and told her that nothing had gone amiss. The hideous and indescribable stench now welling out was absolutely harmless and unfortunately necessary. Solitude was the one prime essential, and he would appear later for dinner. That afternoon, after the conclusion of some odd hissing sounds which came from behind the locked portal, he did finally appear; wearing an extremely haggard aspect and forbidding anyone to enter the laboratory upon any pretext. This, indeed, proved the beginning of a new policy of secrecy; for never afterward was any other person permitted to visit either the mysterious garret workroom or the adjacent storeroom which he cleaned out, furnished roughly, and added to his inviolably private domain as a sleeping apartment. Here he lived, with books brought up from his library beneath, till the time he purchased the Pawtuxet bungalow and moved to it all his scientific effects.      In the evening Charles secured the paper before the rest of the family and damaged part of it through an apparent accident. Later on Dr. Willett, having fixed the date from statements by various members of the household, looked up an intact copy at the Journal office and found that in the destroyed section the following small item had occurred:Nocturnal Diggers Surprised inNorth Burial GroundRobert Hart, night watchman at the North Burial Ground, this morning discovered a party of several men with a motor truck in the oldest part of the cemetery, but apparently frightened them off before they had accomplished whatever their object may have been.      The discovery took place at about four oclock, when Harts attention was attracted by the sound of a motor outside his shelter. Investigating, he saw a large truck on the main drive several rods away; but could not reach it before the sound of his feet on the gravel had revealed his approach. The men hastily placed a large box in the truck and drove away toward the street before they could be overtaken; and since no known grave was disturbed, Hart believes that this box was an object which they wished to bury.      The diggers must have been at work for a long while before detection, for Hart found an enormous hole dug at a considerable distance back from the roadway in the lot of Amasa Field, where most of the old stones have long ago disappeared. The hole, a place as large and deep as a grave, was empty; and did not coincide with any interment mentioned in the cemetery records.      Sergt. Riley of the Second Station viewed the spot and gave the opinion that the hole was dug by bootleggers rather gruesomely and ingeniously seeking a safe cache for liquor in a place not likely to be disturbed. In reply to questions Hart said he thought the escaping truck had headed up Rochambeau Avenue, though he could not be sure.      During the next few days Ward was seldom seen by his family. Having added sleeping quarters to his attic realm, he kept closely to himself there, ordering food brought to the door and not taking it in until after the servant had gone away. The droning of monotonous formulae and the chanting of bizarre rhythms recurred at intervals, while at other times occasional listeners could detect the sound of tinkling glass, hissing chemicals, running water, or roaring gas flames. Odours of the most unplaceable quality, wholly unlike any before noted, hung at times around the door; and the air of tension observable in the young recluse whenever he did venture briefly forth was such as to excite the keenest speculation. Once he made a hasty trip to the Athenaeum for a book he required, and again he hired a messenger to fetch him a highly obscure volume from Boston. Suspense was written portentously over the whole situation, and both the family and Dr. Willett confessed themselves wholly at a loss what to do or think about it.6.      Then on the fifteenth of April a strange development occurred. While nothing appeared to grow different in kind, there was certainly a very terrible difference in degree; and Dr. Willett somehow attaches great significance to the change. The day was Good Friday, a circumstance of which the servants made much, but which others quite naturally dismiss as an irrelevant coincidence. Late in the afternoon young Ward began repeating a certain formula in a singularly loud voice, at the same time burning some substance so pungent that its fumes escaped over the entire house. The formula was so plainly audible in the hall outside the locked door that Mrs. Ward could not help memorising it as she waited and listened anxiously, and later on she was able to write it down at Dr. Willetts request. It ran as follows, and experts have told Dr. Willett that its very close analogue can be found in the mystic writings of \"Eliphas Levi\", that cryptic soul who crept through a crack in the forbidden door and glimpsed the frightful vistas of the void beyond:\"Per Adonai Eloim, Adonai Jehova,Adonai Sabaoth, Metraton On Agla Mathon,verbum pythonicum, mysterium salamandrae,conventus sylvorum, antra gnomorum,daemonia Coeli Gad, Almousin, Gibor, Jehosua,Evam, Zariatnatmik, veni, veni, veni.\"      This had been going on for two hours without change or intermission when over all the neighbourhood a pandaemoniac howling of dogs set in. The extent of this howling can be judged from the space it received in the papers the next day, but to those in the Ward household it was overshadowed by the odour which instantly followed it; a hideous, all-pervasive odour which none of them had ever smelt before or have ever smelt since. In the midst of this mephitic flood there came a very perceptible flash like that of lightning, which would have been blinding and impressive but for the daylight around; and then was heard the voice that no listener can ever forget because of its thunderous remoteness, its incredible depth, and its eldritch dissimilarity to Charles Wards voice. It shook the house, and was clearly heard by at least two neighbours above the howling of the dogs. Mrs. Ward, who had been listening in despair outside her sons locked laboratory, shivered as she recognised its hellish import; for Charles had told her of its evil fame in dark books, and of the manner in which it had thundered, according to the Fenner letters, above the doomed Pawtuxet farmhouse on the night of Joseph Curwens annihilation. There was no mistaking that nightmare phrase, for Charles had described it too vividly in the old days when he had talked frankly of his Curwen investigations. And yet it was only this fragment of an archaic and forgotten language: \"DIES MIES JESCHET BOENE DOESEF DOUVEMA ENITEMAUS\".      Close upon this thundering there came a momentary darkening of the daylight, though sunset was still an hour distant, and then a puff of added odour different from the first but equally unknown and intolerable. Charles was chanting again now and his mother could hear syllables that sounded like \"Yi-nash-Yog-Sothoth-he-lgeb-fi-throdog\" - ending in a \"Yah!\" whose maniacal force mounted in an ear-splitting crescendo. A second later all previous memories were effaced by the wailing scream which burst out with frantic explosiveness and gradually changed form to a paroxysm of diabolic and hysterical laughter. Mrs. Ward, with the mingled fear and blind courage of maternity, advanced and knocked affrightedly at the concealing panels, but obtained no sign of recognition. She knocked again, but paused nervelessly as a second shriek arose, this one unmistakably in the familiar voice of her son, and sounding concurrently with the still bursting cachinnations of that other voice. Presently she fainted, although she is still unable to recall the precise and immediate cause. Memory sometimes makes merciful deletions.      Mr. Ward returned from the business section at about quarter past six; and not finding his wife downstairs, was told by the frightened servants that she was probably watching at Charless door, from which the sounds had been far stranger than ever before. Mounting the stairs at once, he saw Mrs. Ward stretched at full length on the floor of the corridor outside the laboratory; and realising that she had fainted, hastened to fetch a glass of water from a set bowl in a neighbouring alcove. Dashing the cold fluid in her face, he was heartened to observe an immediate response on her part, and was watching the bewildered opening of her eyes when a chill shot through him and threatened to reduce him to the very state from which she was emerging. For the seemingly silent laboratory was not as silent as it had appeared to be, but held the murmurs of a tense, muffled conversation in tones too low for comprehension, yet of a quality profoundly disturbing to the soul.      It was not, of course, new for Charles to mutter formulae; but this muttering was definitely different. It was so palpably a dialogue, or imitation of a dialogue, with the regular alteration of inflections suggesting question and answer, statement and response. One voice was undisguisedly that of Charles, but the other had a depth and hollowness which the youths best powers of ceremonial mimicry had scarcely approached before. There was something hideous, blasphemous, and abnormal about it, and but for a cry from his recovering wife which cleared his mind by arousing his protective instincts it is not likely that Theodore Howland Ward could have maintained for nearly a year more his old boast that he had never fainted. As it was, he seized his wife in his arms and bore her quickly downstairs before she could notice the voices which had so horribly disturbed him. Even so, however, he was not quick enough to escape catching something himself which caused him to stagger dangerously with his burden. For Mrs. Wards cry had evidently been heard by others than he, and there had come from behind the locked door the first distinguishable words which that masked and terrible colloquy had yielded. They were merely an excited caution in Charless own voice, but somehow their implications held a nameless fright for the father who overheard them. The phrase was just this: \"Sshh! - write!\"      Mr. and Mrs. Ward conferred at some length after dinner, and the former resolved to have a firm and serious talk with Charles that very night. No matter how important the object, such conduct could no longer be permitted; for these latest developments transcended every limit of sanity and formed a menace to the order and nervous well-being of the entire household. The youth must indeed have taken complete leave of his senses, since only downright madness could have prompted the wild screams and imaginary conversations in assumed voices which the present day had brought forth. All this must be stopped, or Mrs. Ward would be made ill and the keeping of servants become an impossibility.      Mr. Ward rose at the close of the meal and started upstairs for Charless laboratory. On the third floor, however, he paused at the sounds which he heard proceeding from the now disused library of his son. Books were apparently being flung about and papers wildly rustled, and upon stepping to the door Mr. Ward beheld the youth within, excitedly assembling a vast armful of literary matter of every size and shape. Charless aspect was very drawn and haggard, and he dropped his entire load with a start at the sound of his fathers voice. At the elder mans command he sat down, and for some time listened to the admonitions he had so long deserved. There was no scene. At the end of the lecture he agreed that his father was right, and that his noises, mutterings, incantations, and chemical odours were indeed inexcusable nuisances. He agreed to a policy of greater quiet, though insisting on a prolongation of his extreme privacy. Much of his future work, he said, was in any case purely book research; and he could obtain quarters elsewhere for any such vocal rituals as might be necessary at a later stage. For the fright and fainting of his mother he expressed the keenest contrition, and explained that the conversation later heard was part of an elaborate symbolism designed to create a certain mental atmosphere. His use of abstruse technical terms somewhat bewildered Mr. Ward, but the parting impression was one of undeniable sanity and poise despite a mysterious tension of the utmost gravity. The interview was really quite inconclusive, and as Charles picked up his armful and left the room Mr. Ward hardly knew what to make of the entire business. It was as mysterious as the death of poor old Nig, whose stiffening form had been found an hour before in the basement, with staring eyes and fear-distorted mouth.      Driven by some vague detective instinct, the bewildered parent now glanced curiously at the vacant shelves to see what his son had taken up to the attic. The youths library was plainly and rigidly classified, so that one might tell at a glance the books or at least the kind of books which had been withdrawn. On this occasion Mr. Ward was astonished to find that nothing of the occult or the antiquarian, beyond what had been previously removed, was missing. These new withdrawals were all modern items; histories, scientific treatises, geographies, manuals of literature, philosophic works, and certain contemporary newspapers and magazines. It was a very curious shift from Charles Wards recent run of reading, and the father paused in a growing vortex of perplexity and an engulfing sense of strangeness. The strangeness was a very poignant sensation, and almost clawed at his chest as he strove to see just what was wrong around him. Something was indeed wrong, and tangibly as well as spiritually so. Ever since he had been in this room he had known that something was amiss, and at last it dawned upon him what it was.      On the north wall rose still the ancient carved overmantel from the house in Olney Court, but to the cracked and precariously restored oils of the large Curwen portrait disaster had come. Time and unequal heating had done their work at last, and at some time since the rooms last cleaning the worst had happened. Peeling clear of the wood, curling tighter and tighter, and finally crumbling into small bits with what must have been malignly silent suddenness, the portrait of Joseph Curwen had resigned forever its staring surveillance of the youth it so strangely resembled, and now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust.", "A smile lit Goros dark face. He looked down at the elegant dark blue kimono in his arms. \"Its beautiful.\" Torren-Wraeth smiled in return, he loved to see Goro smile. \"It belongs to you, Goro-chan.\" \"But, this is too...\" \"You deserve it far more than any pampered noble.\" The dark-skinned youth blushed. \"Thank you, Torren-kun!\" As Goro dressed, Torren-Wraeth looked at his own kimono, bright red and fashionable. He had worried about attracting undue attention with the appearance of wealth, but he decided that he was strong enough to risk any human robber or thief. Besides, this was to be their first trip to the Kabuki theater. It had taken enough time and effort to make himself appear human, he might as well show off. He looked up at Goro, partly dressed and excitedly pulling himself together. He thought of the men who had abused him, and felt a twitch of rage... Goro must never find out what Torren-Wraeth had done to those men. He did not want Goro to ever even hear the name YGolonac, much less learn what he was, how he dealt with his victims. Torren-Wraeth loathed YGolonac, the Defiler, the Obscenity, the obese, headless god of depravity, who devoured his victims slowly with the mouths in the palms of his flabby, groping hands. But he had to avenge Goro, he had to make them pay for using him, for torturing him, for robbing him of his childhood and his innocence. Only YGolonac could grant the punishment those men deserved... Then Goro was standing there, smiling, in his blue kimono, and Torren-Wraeth was happy again...Torren-Wraeth awoke slowly, not wanting to leave his dream, because Goro still lived in his dreams... He was in China, not Japan, in the Monastery of The Order of The Bloated Woman. Japan was gone, Goro was gone, and Torren-Wraeth was still here. Warm tears ran down his cheeks, but he brushed them away. Life had to go on, and on, and on...Great Cthulhu was concerned. Hastur seemed to have gained some favor in Nyarlathoteps many eyes, and anything that benefited Hastur weakened Cthulhu, in both their eyes. \"My Lord Cthulhu, there is no need for concern,\" The tall, red-robed figure that stood at the side of Cthulhus throne moved forward respectfully, Chxixsas bone-white face seemed to swim within his voluminous robes, \"It is well known that the fruits of Nyarlathoteps attentions are rarely to be desired.\" The voice was thin, hollow, distant, \" This may prove, in fact, a setback for The King in Tatters. Even now he trembles in his palace at Carcosa, fearing what manner of spawn this union may unleash.\" Cthulhu gave the equivalent of a laugh, \"Can you picture them, The Black Wind knocking down the walls of Carcosa, the Bloody Tongue crushing that cursed palace into dust! Oh, one can dream, Chxixsas... One can dream...\"The two masks, the Golden Angel and the Slender Maiden stood side by side, Isnt it all a lie, in the end? Torren-Wraeth bowed politely before the Bloated Woman. She was holding the Black Fan under her eyes, giving the illusion that she was a slender young lady, at least to the humans present. Ho Fong stood by reverently, but his jealousy of Tek was as strong as ever. Torren-Wraeth wondered if The Bloated Woman would play them against each other...He hoped not, for both their sakes. \"It is an honor to again have the presence of the Son of Cthulhu in my humble monastery.\" \"The honor is all mine,\" Torren-Wraeth replied softly, \"My father sends his greetings and good-will toward you, My Lady.\" The Bloated Womans nose-tendril curled delicately in the air, \"No doubt. Send him my good-will in return.\" Torren-Wraeth couldnt help but look at the sacrificial altar, where human victims had their arms cut off by the sacred sickles, after which they bled to death. He shuddered slightly at the horrible images flashing through his mind. The Bloated Woman noted this, but politely made no mention of it. Torren-Wraeth honestly could not condemn her, almost all of the worshiped entities, including his own father, demanded human sacrifice, many in even more horrible ways... \"I regret that I have to leave so soon, though I am grateful for your hospitality.\" The last part, at least, was true. \"May The Key and The Gate be with you.\""]}

A Result and a Prologue1.From a private hospital for the insane near Providence, Rhode Island, there recently disappeared an exceedingly singular person. He bore the name of Charles Dexter Ward, and was placed under restraint most reluctantly by the grieving father who had watched his aberration grow from a mere eccentricity to a dark mania involving both a possibility of murderous tendencies and a profound and peculiar change in the apparent contents of his mind. Doctors confess themselves quite baffled by his case, since it presented oddities of a general physiological as well as psychological character.      In the first place, the patient seemed oddly older than his twenty-six years would warrant. Mental disturbance, it is true, will age one rapidly; but the face of this young man had taken on a subtle cast which only the very aged normally acquire. In the second place, his organic processes shewed a certain queerness of proportion which nothing in medical experience can parallel. Respiration and heart action had a baffling lack of symmetry; the voice was lost, so that no sounds above a whisper were possible; digestion was incredibly prolonged and minimised, and neural reactions to standard stimuli bore no relation at all to anything heretofore recorded, either normal or pathological. The skin had a morbid chill and dryness, and the cellular structure of the tissue seemed exaggeratedly coarse and loosely knit. Even a large olive birthmark on the right hip had disappeared, whilst there had formed on the chest a very peculiar mole or blackish spot of which no trace existed before. In general, all physicians agree that in Ward the processes of metabolism had become retarded to a degree beyond precedent.      Psychologically, too, Charles Ward was unique. His madness held no affinity to any sort recorded in even the latest and most exhaustive of treatises, and was conjoined to a mental force which would have made him a genius or a leader had it not been twisted into strange and grotesque forms. Dr. Willett, who was Wards family physician, affirms that the patients gross mental capacity, as gauged by his response to matters outside the sphere of his insanity, had actually increased since the seizure. Ward, it is true, was always a scholar and an antiquarian; but even his most brilliant early work did not shew the prodigious grasp and insight displayed during his last examinations by the alienists. It was, indeed, a difficult matter to obtain a legal commitment to the hospital, so powerful and lucid did the youths mind seem; and only on the evidence of others, and on the strength of many abnormal gaps in his stock of information as distinguished from his intelligence, was he finally placed in confinement. To the very moment of his vanishment he was an omnivorous reader and as great a conversationalist as his poor voice permitted; and shrewd observers, failing to foresee his escape, freely predicted that he would not be long in gaining his discharge from custody.      Only Dr. Willett, who brought Charles Ward into the world and had watched his growth of body and mind ever since, seemed frightened at the thought of his future freedom. He had had a terrible experience and had made a terrible discovery which he dared not reveal to his sceptical colleagues. Willett, indeed, presents a minor mystery all his own in his connexion with the case. He was the last to see the patient before his flight, and emerged from that final conversation in a state of mixed horror and relief which several recalled when Wards escape became known three hours later. That escape itself is one of the unsolved wonders of Dr. Waites hospital. A window open above a sheer drop of sixty feet could hardly explain it, yet after that talk with Willett the youth was undeniably gone. Willett himself has no public explanations to offer, though he seems strangely easier in mind than before the escape. Many, indeed, feel that he would like to say more if he thought any considerable number would believe him. He had found Ward in his room, but shortly after his departure the attendants knocked in vain. When they opened the door the patient was not there, and all they found was the open window with a chill April breeze blowing in a cloud of fine bluish-grey dust that almost choked them. True, the dogs howled some time before; but that was while Willett was still present, and they had caught nothing and shewn no disturbance later on. Wards father was told at once over the telephone, but he seemed more saddened than surprised. By the time Dr. Waite called in person, Dr. Willett had been talking with him, and both disavowed any knowledge or complicity in the escape. Only from certain closely confidential friends of Willett and the senior Ward have any clues been gained, and even these are too wildly fantastic for general credence. The one fact which remains is that up to the present time no trace of the missing madman has been unearthed.      Charles Ward was an antiquarian from infancy, no doubt gaining his taste from the venerable town around him, and from the relics of the past which filled every corner of his parents old mansion in Prospect Street on the crest of the hill. With the years his devotion to ancient things increased; so that history, genealogy, and the study of colonial architecture, furniture, and craftsmanship at length crowded everything else from his sphere of interests. These tastes are important to remember in considering his madness; for although they do not form its absolute nucleus, they play a prominent part in its superficial form. The gaps of information which the alienists noticed were all related to modern matters, and were invariably offset by a correspondingly excessive though outwardly concealed knowledge of bygone matters as brought out by adroit questioning; so that one would have fancied the patient literally transferred to a former age through some obscure sort of auto-hypnosis. The odd thing was that Ward seemed no longer interested in the antiquities he knew so well. He had, it appears, lost his regard for them through sheer familiarity; and all his final efforts were obviously bent toward mastering those common facts of the modern world which had been so totally and unmistakably expunged from his brain. That this wholesale deletion had occurred, he did his best to hide; but it was clear to all who watched him that his whole programme of reading and conversation was determined by a frantic wish to imbibe such knowledge of his own life and of the ordinary practical and cultural background of the twentieth century as ought to have been his by virtue of his birth in 1902 and his education in the schools of our own time. Alienists are now wondering how, in view of his vitally impaired range of data, the escaped patient manages to cope with the complicated world of today; the dominant opinion being that he is lying low in some humble and unexacting position till his stock of modern information can be brought up to the normal.      The beginning of Wards madness is a matter of dispute among alienists. Dr. Lyman, the eminent Boston authority, places it in 1919 or 1920, during the boys last year at the Moses Brown School, when he suddenly turned from the study of the past to the study of the occult, and refused to qualify for college on the ground that he had individual researches of much greater importance to make. This is certainly borne out by Wards altered habits at the time, especially by his continual search through town records and among old burying-grounds for a certain grave dug in 1771; the grave of an ancestor named Joseph Curwen, some of whose papers he professed to have found behind the panelling of a very old house in Olney Court, on Stampers Hill, which Curwen was known to have built and occupied. It is, broadly speaking, undeniable that the winter of 1919-20 saw a great change in Ward; whereby he abruptly stopped his general antiquarian pursuits and embarked on a desperate delving into occult subjects both at home and abroad, varied only by this strangely persistent search for his forefathers grave.      From this opinion, however, Dr. Willett substantially dissents; basing his verdict on his close and continuous knowledge of the patient, and on certain frightful investigations and discoveries which he made toward the last. Those investigations and discoveries have left their mark upon him; so that his voice trembles when he tells them, and his hand trembles when he tries to write of them. Willett admits that the change of 1919-20 would ordinarily appear to mark the beginning of a progressive decadence which culminated in the horrible and uncanny alienation of 1928; but believes from personal observation that a finer distinction must be made. Granting freely that the boy was always ill-balanced temperamentally, and prone to be unduly susceptible and enthusiastic in his responses to phenomena around him, he refuses to concede that the early alteration marked the actual passage from sanity to madness; crediting instead Wards own statement that he had discovered or rediscovered something whose effect on human thought was likely to be marvellous and profound. The true madness, he is certain, came with a later change; after the Curwen portrait and the ancient papers had been unearthed; after a trip to strange foreign places had been made, and some terrible invocations chanted under strange and secret circumstances; after certain answers to these invocations had been plainly indicated, and a frantic letter penned under agonising and inexplicable conditions; after the wave of vampirism and the ominous Pawtuxet gossip; and after the patients memory commenced to exclude contemporary images whilst his voice failed and his physical aspect underwent the subtle modification so many subsequently noticed.      It was only about this time, Willett points out with much acuteness, that the nightmare qualities became indubitably linked with Ward; and the doctor feels shudderingly sure that enough solid evidence exists to sustain the youths claim regarding his crucial discovery. In the first place, two workmen of high intelligence saw Joseph Curwens ancient papers found. Secondly, the boy once shewed Dr. Willett those papers and a page of the Curwen diary, and each of the documents had every appearance of genuineness. The hole where Ward claimed to have found them was long a visible reality, and Willett had a very convincing final glimpse of them in surroundings which can scarcely be believed and can never perhaps be proved. Then there were the mysteries and coincidences of the Orne and Hutchinson letters, and the problem of the Curwen penmanship and of what the detectives brought to light about Dr. Allen; these things, and the terrible message in mediaeval minuscules found in Willetts pocket when he gained consciousness after his shocking experience.      And most conclusive of all, there are the two hideous results which the doctor obtained from a certain pair of formulae during his final investigations; results which virtually proved the authenticity of the papers and of their monstrous implications at the same time that those papers were borne forever from human knowledge.2.      One must look back at Charles Wards earlier life as at something belonging as much to the past as the antiquities he loved so keenly. In the autumn of 1918, and with a considerable show of zest in the military training of the period, he had begun his junior year at the Moses Brown School, which lies very near his home. The old main building, erected in 1819, had always charmed his youthful antiquarian sense; and the spacious park in which the academy is set appealed to his sharp eye for landscape. His social activities were few; and his hours were spent mainly at home, in rambling walks, in his classes and drills, and in pursuit of antiquarian and genealogical data at the City Hall, the State House, the Public Library, the Athenaeum, the Historical Society, the John Carter Brown and John Hay Libraries of Brown University, and the newly opened Shepley Library in Benefit Street. One may picture him yet as he was in those days; tall, slim, and blond, with studious eyes and a slight stoop, dressed somewhat carelessly, and giving a dominant impression of harmless awkwardness rather than attractiveness.      His walks were always adventures in antiquity, during which he managed to recapture from the myriad relics of a glamorous old city a vivid and connected picture of the centuries before. His home was a great Georgian mansion atop the well-nigh precipitous hill that rises just east of the river; and from the rear windows of its rambling wings he could look dizzily out over all the clustered spires, domes, roofs, and skyscraper summits of the lower town to the purple hills of the countryside beyond. Here he was born, and from the lovely classic porch of the double-bayed brick facade his nurse had first wheeled him in his carriage; past the little white farmhouse of two hundred years before that the town had long ago overtaken, and on toward the stately colleges along the shady, sumptuous street, whose old square brick mansions and smaller wooden houses with narrow, heavy-columned Doric porches dreamed solid and exclusive amidst their generous yards and gardens.      He had been wheeled, too, along sleepy Congdon Street, one tier lower down on the steep hill, and with all its eastern homes on high terraces. The small wooden houses averaged a greater age here, for it was up this hill that the growing town had climbed; and in these rides he had imbibed something of the colour of a quaint colonial village. The nurse used to stop and sit on the benches of Prospect Terrace to chat with policemen; and one of the childs first memories was of the great westward sea of hazy roofs and domes and steeples and far hills which he saw one winter afternoon from that great railed embankment, all violet and mystic against a fevered, apocalyptic sunset of reds and golds and purples and curious greens. The vast marble dome of the State House stood out in massive silhouette, its crowning statue haloed fantastically by a break in one of the tinted stratus clouds that barred the flaming sky.      When he was larger his famous walks began; first with his impatiently dragged nurse, and then alone in dreamy meditation. Farther and farther down that almost perpendicular hill he would venture, each time reaching older and quainter levels of the ancient city. He would hesitate gingerly down vertical Jenckes Street with its bank walls and colonial gables to the shady Benefit Street corner, where before him was a wooden antique with an Ionic-pilastered pair of doorways, and beside him a prehistoric gambrel-roofer with a bit of primal farmyard remaining, and the great Judge Durfee house with its fallen vestiges of Georgian grandeur. It was getting to be a slum here; but the titan elms cast a restoring shadow over the place, and the boy used to stroll south past the long lines of the pre-Revolutionary homes with their great central chimneys and classic portals. On the eastern side they were set high over basements with railed double flights of stone steps, and the young Charles could picture them as they were when the street was new, and red heels and periwigs set off the painted pediments whose signs of wear were now becoming so visible.      Westward the hill dropped almost as steeply as above, down to the old \"Town Street\" that the founders had laid out at the rivers edge in 1636. Here ran innumerable little lanes with leaning, huddled houses of immense antiquity; and fascinated though he was, it was long before he dared to thread their archaic verticality for fear they would turn out a dream or a gateway to unknown terrors. He found it much less formidable to continue along Benefit Street past the iron fence of St. Johns hidden churchyard and the rear of the 1761 Colony House and the mouldering bulk of the Golden Ball Inn where Washington stopped. At Meeting Street - the successive Gaol Lane and King Street of other periods - he would look upward to the east and see the arched flight of steps to which the highway had to resort in climbing the slope, and downward to the west, glimpsing the old brick colonial schoolhouse that smiles across the road at the ancient Sign of Shakespears Head where the Providence Gazette and Country-Journal was printed before the Revolution. Then came the exquisite First Baptist Church of 1775, luxurious with its matchless Gibbs steeple, and the Georgian roofs and cupolas hovering by. Here and to the southward the neighbourhood became better, flowering at last into a marvellous group of early mansions; but still the little ancient lanes led off down the precipice to the west, spectral in their many-gabled archaism and dipping to a riot of iridescent decay where the wicked old waterfront recalls its proud East India days amidst polyglot vice and squalor, rotting wharves, and blear-eyed ship-chandleries, with such surviving alley names as Packet, Bullion, Gold, Silver, Coin, Doubloon, Sovereign, Guilder, Dollar, Dime, and Cent.      Sometimes, as he grew taller and more adventurous, young Ward would venture down into this maelstrom of tottering houses, broken transoms, tumbling steps, twisted balustrades, swarthy faces, and nameless odours; winding from South Main to South Water, searching out the docks where the bay and sound steamers still touched, and returning northward at this lower level past the steep-roofed 1816 warehouses and the broad square at the Great Bridge, where the 1773 Market House still stands firm on its ancient arches. In that square he would pause to drink in the bewildering beauty of the old town as it rises on its eastward bluff, decked with its two Georgian spires and crowned by the vast new Christian Science dome as London is crowned by St. Pauls. He liked mostly to reach this point in the late afternoon, when the slanting sunlight touches the Market House and the ancient hill roofs and belfries with gold, and throws magic around the dreaming wharves where Providence Indiamen used to ride at anchor. After a long look he would grow almost dizzy with a poets love for the sight, and then he would scale the slope homeward in the dusk past the old white church and up the narrow precipitous ways where yellow gleams would begin to peep out in small-paned windows and through fanlights set high over double flights of steps with curious wrought-iron railings.      At other times, and in later years, he would seek for vivid contrasts; spending half a walk in the crumbling colonial regions northwest of his home, where the hill drops to the lower eminence of Stampers Hill with its ghetto and negro quarter clustering round the place where the Boston stage coach used to start before the Revolution, and the other half in the gracious southerly realm about George, Benevolent, Power, and Williams Streets, where the old slope holds unchanged the fine estates and bits of walled garden and steep green lane in which so many fragrant memories linger. These rambles, together with the diligent studies which accompanied them, certainly account for a large amount of the antiquarian lore which at last crowded the modern world from Charles Wards mind; and illustrate the mental soil upon which fell, in that fateful winter of 1919-20, the seeds that came to such strange and terrible fruition.      Dr. Willett is certain that, up to this ill-omened winter of first change, Charles Wards antiquarianism was free from every trace of the morbid. Graveyards held for him no particular attraction beyond their quaintness and historic value, and of anything like violence or savage instinct he was utterly devoid. Then, by insidious degrees, there appeared to develop a curious sequel to one of his genealogical triumphs of the year before; when he had discovered among his maternal ancestors a certain very long-lived man named Joseph Curwen, who had come from Salem in March of 1692, and about whom a whispered series of highly peculiar and disquieting stories clustered.      Wards great-great-grandfather Welcome Potter had in 1785 married a certain \"Ann Tillinghast, daughter of Mrs. Eliza, daughter to Capt. James Tillinghast\", of whose paternity the family had preserved no trace. Late in 1918, whilst examining a volume of original town records in manuscript, the young genealogist encountered an entry describing a legal change of name, by which in 1772 a Mrs. Eliza Curwen, widow of Joseph Curwen, resumed, along with her seven-year-old daughter Ann, her maiden name of Tillinghast; on the ground that her Husbands name was become a publick Reproach by Reason of what was knowne after his Decease; the which confirming an antient common Rumour, tho not to be credited by a loyall Wife till so proven as to be wholely past Doubting. This entry came to light upon the accidental separation of two leaves which had been carefully pasted together and treated as one by a laboured revision of the page numbers.      It was at once clear to Charles Ward that he had indeed discovered a hitherto unknown great-great-great-grandfather. The discovery doubly excited him because he had already heard vague reports and seen scattered allusions relating to this person; about whom there remained so few publicly available records, aside from those becoming public only in modern times, that it almost seemed as if a conspiracy had existed to blot him from memory. What did appear, moreover, was of such a singular and provocative nature that one could not fail to imagine curiously what it was that the colonial recorders were so anxious to conceal and forget; or to suspect that the deletion had reasons all too valid.      Before this, Ward had been content to let his romancing about old Joseph Curwen remain in the idle stage; but having discovered his own relationship to this apparently \"hushed-up\" character, he proceeded to hunt out as systematically as possible whatever he might find concerning him. In this excited quest he eventually succeeded beyond his highest expectations; for old letters, diaries, and sheaves of unpublished memoirs in cobwebbed Providence garrets and elsewhere yielded many illuminating passages which their writers had not thought it worth their while to destroy. One important sidelight came from a point as remote as New York, where some Rhode Island colonial correspondence was stored in the Museum at Fraunces Tavern. The really crucial thing, though, and what in Dr. Willetts opinion formed the definite source of Wards undoing, was the matter found in August 1919 behind the panelling of the crumbling house in Olney Court. It was that, beyond a doubt, which opened up those black vistas whose end was deeper than the pit.", "Ordinarily, one wouldnt think of the Dreamers Inn as a mausoleum any more than one would think of the Golden Goose restaurant as a crypt. Journeymen who are just passing through Leight, and rooming at the Inn as a matter of convenience, will see nothing amiss. There are a few splintering floorboards here, and a couple of sagging roof beams there, but these things are only natural for a lodging house thats stood for more than two centuries. I, however, with my wary eyes and cautious steps, notice more ominous flaws: the dry rot in the walls, for instance, and the stairs that are almost murderously steep. How on Earth does Monsieur Thènard keep the Inn open despite its decay and stale air? Perhaps he himself has had a part in spreading rumors about it, challenging brave visitors to spend the entire night in a haunted hotel.Then again, maybe it all boils down to the Inn being the most immediate place for a nights slumber. When one is tired and hungry, weary from sitting in a carriage or on horseback, then why not stay here?\"Good evening, Mademoiselle Dawson,\" announces an oily voice. \"Welcome to the Dreamers Inn.\"My spine stiffens. If this place is a tomb, then Monsieur Thènard is the shifty undertaker whod give you your six feet of earth once you had passed, then dig you up if your relatives couldnt pay the maintenance fees. His smile resembles a scythes blade: the one that Death wields, and with which he harvests you.\"Good evening to you too, Monsieur Thènard,\" I tell him as civilly as I can. \"Id like to rent a room, please.\"\"Certainly.\" He pauses. \"I am surprised to see you here. Can you not stay at your fathers house for free?\"\"Of course, but I have my reasons. If you must know, Im on an errand to quell all the rumors about this hotel. You and I could both stand to have more revenue coming from it, after all. What better way to do that than to put vicious village talk to rest? You know what the people say: its haunted, and not by your ordinary ghosts. They also claim that certain people, once they lie down to sleep here, never awaken. Pah! If someone wakes up dead, pardon the silly expression, then their heart failed during the night, or they perished from some other natural cause. No devilry is here, and Im out to prove it once and for all.\"\"Mais oui,\" he says, grinning. \"We two know that, but how are you going to convince the rest of Leight?\"\"I intend to spend three consecutive nights here, not just one, and come out none the worse for wear. I know that the people here typically dont listen to a godless spinster. However, if I tell them that theres nothing to fear at the Dreamers Inn - save a few usual nightmares from sleeping in a strange place - perhaps they will take heed, and tell their traveling friends and relatives to pay this establishment a visit.\"\"A splendid plan,\" Thènard replies. \"I hope it works, and here is the cost of three nights lodging.\" When he reveals it, I wince. Its not exorbitant, meaning that I can still afford it, but barely. With Theodora receiving her months wages yesterday, plus my paying an ample bill of goods from the grocer, Ill be spent out by the end of my stay. Im glad that its almost the end of October: Halloween will arrive in exactly three days. Once its November, my monthly pension allowance will be full again, and I can start all over.Still, I feel like a fool. Truly, is there any starting over when one keeps going round in the same circle?\"Mademoiselle?\" Startled out of my reverie, I pay him. \"Agathe is still serving food in the kitchen,\" Thènard tells me, referring to his wizened maid-of-all-work. \"There arent enough guests for her to have served dinner in the dining room, so Im glad youve come.\" All of a sudden, he leans forward and winks at me. \"Should you require company upstairs…\"\"Give me my key, and Ill be off.\"He opens a drawer behind his porters desk and hands it over, smirking. \"Room two, second floor.\""]}
{"id": "EN087", "pair": ["Day 1-I never would imagine such thing would happen, in this diary I will document my strange and disturbing events. Once I was a normal respected teacher at Miskatonic, and then a member of this \"great race\" appears and teleports me to this place…its just too surreal, this place is a gigantic library, whit knowledge of humanity and more…this large creature its just disgusting, I just never saw something like this, its just bizarre. The flowers are just biologically impossible, but they are there. I am a prisoner? This place is huge, the race its big! Like a small building, I just imagine how impossibly big an entire city would be…I am like a mouse in a skyscraper. I try my best to sleep…god have mercy upon me. I have difficulty knowing what is day and what is night…because there are not windows, I have a theory that this place is underground. A few minutes after wandering around, my captor opens the massive door, ah I have forgotten, this room is almost alone without objects of my size, the only thing here is a giant sized TV with a typewriter on it. What kind of technology these creatures possess? I see that the giant clicks these claws constantly…why? Its some sort of communication? Suddenly he throws to me a metal box with a button on top of it, \"what sort of thing is this, creature?\" I ask. The giant just clicks this right claw. Without any other option I push the small cylinder, and nothing noticeable happens. But then it makes a long series of clicks again and the box suddenly begins to…talk: \"hello Wilhelm. I am a Yithnian, and I want your help. I have seen with horror that a god will crash-land on earth in two weeks! He is trapped in a suit that will retrain this great and immeasurable power. I will travel in time to bring him to you so we can begin our project\" suddenly he disappeared in an after-image. The thing he said…it was unbelievable a god exists, and he wants my help.Day…2 (i suppose) I been alone in this blank room for 4 hours…and when I was taken it was 1:30. Ok that is not the point. In this room there some sort of big book shells that dwarf by a few inches the aliens. I have opened the door to reveal that I was right, if this would be a city of gigantic size I would be like a mouse. Thousands of skyscrapers roam the underground dome that sustains the cave. This is just massive. One of the tallest buildings on earth will be like an electric floor fan compared to these hulks. Its just frightening to try to hide from these monsters. I still dont get why my captor doesnt appear yet. The buildings are made from a metal that is am mesh of golden with gray, and almost every one of them is rectangular. Three minutes remain of this wait and I see that the yith creature has returned, with a strange being in this arm. Also a book of my size; the creature started to click and the machine started to speak: \"I ask forgiveness Wilhelm, the time machine broke and I needed to fix it. Here it is…the great lord of the Outer gods, the blind idiot entity that everyone fears: Azathoth! My luck, our luck could not be greater my friend! He was trapped in the technology of my people and Mi-Gos we can make him anything we want!\" after handing me the book I have a better look at the \"God\" before me. He had a suit with long limbs; this head was highly (and horrifyingly) similar to the shape of the tall Flatiron Building in New York, in this top there were two small triangles that made the illusion of horns or wolf like ears. Little red lines in both sides of the face, (I suppose eyes) the helmet also it was colored silver. I also notice that this body has a light brown straightjacket like appearance. This right and left hands have black gloves (I suppose) with slightly long conical golden claws half of the fingers. These feet and legs are even more bizarre: black to the knees with silver to the lateral malleolus. The feet are the most structurally insane: it looks like a golden flat spike. It appears that this creature is unconscious. The book has revealed me some clues: Azathoth he is the most powerful entity in our universe, also the creator of a creator of other gods! The yiths are the race of my captor. They want to use the knowledge of my race to their disposal, what one? I dare not to put it in this diary…it would make anyone insane. The creature \"spoken\" to my again about why I am here; \"I want to give to the Outer God a new chance, one to redeem him/itself to use it as a tool for good. I will train you in a place that I made where time is infinite, where you dont need to eat, you will not exhaust, where you will not age. There I will make you a super intelligent being, due to the fact that there is technology of my race you will need to learn it. And you will make Azathoth something more than human.\" After that a door on a wall suddenly appeared, the place inside of it was blank grey. I am surprised of what I will do…I will create something to fight the unknown evil of this world! We will make this monster my monster! The yith told me that the place where we will go is applied named: Infinitely Timed Room.Day 3- the I.T.R. was excellent as a place for learning. I reckon I was there for 200 months. But I am fine to say the least. I finally learned how to manipulate the suit. It was revealed to me that there is a cube that reduces size inside of the helmet. There is a computer inside of that cube that can be modified. If I do that I can change Azathoth into a thinking creature. Also I will make him learn how to change the suit into anything he wants. I get a closer look at the monster and I can assume that he is still unconscious, or he doesnt know how to move. Thanks to a machine I built inside the I.T.R. a metal glob that can change into any human or eldritch tool I call it the anytool. I can mentally command it and only me, I change it into a buzz saw that cuts the center of the helmet. I see with awe that there are two metal cubes inside it. The one on the right has a circular window I see with my own mortal eyes what is in there: the thumb–sized daemon sultan himself. He was shaped like a tridimensional ellipse, in this surface it was covered with something similar to eggs of a fish or an amphibian, they divided the creature into two tones: in the right there where white \"eggs\" and only 3 black ones, there were 4 spiked eggs and white five tubes that have mouths. In the left there are only black eggs and 3 spiked white ones, 2 big human like jaws were located in the far left. Behind it there where mangled tentacles and claws. I see all this thanks to the anytool that I shaped into a microscope.The boxes where lead colored and they were 7cm tall and 7cm breadth. The one that is located upside is the one that constrains him and these powers, there is a mirror in the floor of the cube, the downer cube creates an incredibly thin ray that points into the mirror of the upper cube (they are epilated into a vertical position) that ray is the one that maintains this concurrent size. I cut the cube where the visor is and I slowly modify it.Day 4-I finally finalized the modification, and I closed the helmet. I created a level system: Level 1 makes him use a small bit of this power, with strength capable of lifting 50 tons. Level 2 makes him capable of creating creatures of this own, and this strength are enough powerful to level 10 buildings, Level 3…this one makes him use a quarter of this real power, he is capable of destroying a world with energy based blasts. And this physical strength is unmeasurable. Also I programed the cube (that works like a brain for Azathoth) to only to obey me, but to follow orders of any successor or member of my family.After a few hours the former god awakens and these first words are understandable: \"where…I am, what I am?\" this voice is deep and stern. I shudder what this reaction will be when I tell him the truth. Thankfully I made the upper cube make the thump sized monster a fast learner. \"My name is Wilhelm Smift, your master. Your name is Azathoth.\" The knight like creature stares at me; \"yes…Thou art. But please answer me who am i?\" \"You were a powerful creature, a god. But technological creatures transferred you into a body that constrains your power. Thankfully I have modified it to have a mind that thinks, that talks, without me you would be a blind idiot, all powerful Imbecile! You were a leader of other gods but you never made to them any commands, you where mindless. Now in turn serve me Azathoth, I will make you a tool for justice!\" the creature bows before me, but then to my fear I hear a chilling laugh, \"Why are you laughing daemon sultan?\" he talks to me slowly \"I will become a tool for extermination, isnt it master? I will become a machine only made for killing…ISNT IT MASTER?!\" he suddenly approaches me, whit these arms wide open. \"YOU MADE ME SOMETHING BETTER THAN A MINDLESS FOOL!\" he screams to the ceiling. Then he lungs at me, I expected an attack but the demon instead…hugs me. \"I cant be more grateful\" I dont know what to say, my wishes were answered, but I dread to know why such creature is happy to comply with requests for killing.", "Some people who sleep at the Dreamers Inn, in my hometown of Leight, Massachusetts, never wake up.So it is said. Tis a wonder that our only boarding place for travelers manages to stay open at all, with the ceaseless grinding of the rumor mill reaching wayfarers ears before they reach here. Our villages moniker is pronounced as if the \"e\" were not there, nor any source of illumination. Despite our best efforts to redeem the name of Leight, it is still spoken like a curse. We are God-fearing folk now, in anno Domini 1893, but some of us werent two hundred years ago. The witchcraft panic that had hit Salem in 1692 infected us like a fever one year later. Fifty people were sickened, and cured by a visit to Gallows Hill.My great-great-grandfather and original proprietor of the Inn, Goodman Abner Dawes, was one of them.My name is Millicent Dawson. Even though Im four generations descended from him, respectable people in Leight cross to the other side of the street when they see me. If it werent for my late fathers pension, Id be searching these same streets for men too drunk to care about my ancestry. Im a spinster at thirty-four, but still pretty according to the Inns current owner. Not that Id have Monsieur Thènard! He is no drunkard, but sometimes I wish he were. His eyes, never bloodshot and always keen, are those of a wolf.Is it he that continues to lend the rumors such credence? Has he dared to murder his own customers?Pah! Its far more likely that the villagers, many of whom are superstitious illiterates, want to keep anyone from having anything to do with the Dreamers Inn because theyre terrified. I, for one, am not. I know my great-great-grandfathers establishment for what it is: a broken-down lodging house, greatly refurbished, with three floors and servants quarters at the top. Its the closest thing that Leight has to a castle, because the guest rooms and garret are contained within a tall turret. The Inn is the very sort that inspires ghosts and unspeakable phantoms to possess ones imagination - even mine. I suppose I cannot blame my naïve neighbors too much. If Im out in the evening, having a bite of dinner at our only restaurant, I try not to gaze up at that tower. As it darkens in the fading twilight, it slowly turns blacker than any sort of pitch.What is it about the place that makes me shudder, even though Im not so silly as to believe its haunted?How has it remained a dreamers refuge for more than two centuries, my ancestors toil notwithstanding?Why do I always see it in my own dreams, as it draws me like iron toward a magnet?Such mysteries are better left unsolved. What I must do is remain calm, and grounded in practicalities.The rumors state that no visitor to the Dreamers Inn has ever been a guest for more than one night. Even those travelers who have spent that brief length of time within its walls have departed without a word, in a mad frenzy of escape. Ive lived in Leight all my life, and have no reason to pay for a room when Im safe enough in my late fathers house. Nevertheless, I intend to stay not for one night, but three. I shall prove the chatter of my fellow citizens to be foolish gossip, once and for all, and bring more business to the Inn. I receive a share of its profits, being the only living descendant of its owners throughout the generations.Fathers pension is barely holding out, and with a bitter chill in the air, I need some more money for winter."]}
{"id": "EN050", "pair": ["Hanoi, Socialist Republic of VietnamJune 24, 2011.\"Hey, were here. Get up if you dont want to wake up in Hue!\"Joseph Clayton was shaken awake by the hand of one of his classmates on his shoulder. He was sitting in the back of a taxi van... the only one left sitting, actually, as the others had already disembarked to enter the government office they were parked in front of.Which probably meant that he was left to pay the fare.After he payed (as seemed to be his lot on this trip), he followed his classmates and his professor into the government office where they hoped to finally receive their travel permits. He hadnt gotten much of sleep on the plane; a mixture of excitement in the face of overseas travel and sheer jet-lag had conspired to leave him weary and light headed until he got a few hours sleep, which the taxi ride had partially afforded him.And in that sleep...The dream had come as a stark, clear memory. When Marie had said that she wasnt going to join him at the Miskatonic campus in Arkham for what would be their first year of university, he had been devastated. His first questions, rushed and frantic, had been about the cause of such a change. She certainly had the SAT score to qualify and student debt could be handled with relative ease. Had she decided to forgo post-secondary to concentrate on her stake in the restaurant? Had financial problems struck and prevented admissions from being paid?Was it something about him?Her answers, far more controlled than his frenzied speculation, had all been in the negative. Her SAT scores were good, student loans were still open and she still intended to go for a degree in Biology at Miskatonic. It was just... after shed gotten that phonograph from her parents home village, the repayment had been a promise to come and spend a year back in the \"Old Country\" as soon as she could. It would only be for a year and then she would return, ready for university and all accompaniments.That had been very nearly one year before. She had promised him that she would be coming back in the summer of 2011... but after she had arrived in Vietnam, all contact had stopped cold. Her parents, when asked about her condition, always responded with affirmations that she would return and that she was fine... but as winter wore onto spring, subtle hints of doubt and worry had crept into their voices. Had they even been receiving any news from their daughter and if not, then why not? Had something gone terribly wrong?As it happened, more baffling events awaited inside.\"What do you mean, restricted?\" Joseph asked the Communist Party bureaucrat sitting across the desk from him. Of course, due to the facts that first, said bureaucrat was a government employee and second, they were not alone in the room, Joseph had been careful not to sound too brunt in his tone. A trung sior Sergeant, wearing the forest green uniform of the Vietnam Border Defence Force (VPA), stood by the door of the office, both watching and guarding.Relieved at being able to shed his stilted English after Joseph exhibited a decent grasp of the Vietnamese language, the bureaucrat put forth what he knew of the situation. \"Civilian access is almost completely denied inside the area you requested. To be honest, that section of the border has been troublesome ever since the war. We get reports of smugglers, poachers, bandits, Hmong insurgents... every type of violent counter-revolutionary you can think of, this region seems to have it. The local Bru farmers arent much help, but they generally dont bother others and seem to accept the military presence we keep there.\" The bureaucrat shifted his gaze from Joseph to Professor Neville Andover, the leader of this particular expedition. \"Im sorry, but theres nothing that can be done without high level authorization.\"As a response to this, Neville Andover did not get upset. He did not resign himself to failure. He did not even try to ask if there was any other avenue of entry or way to access the information he needed. He just donned an odd, amused smile, the corners of his eyes crinkling behind his wire rim glasses. \"I assume that General Vo is still the Secretary for the Border Forces?\" He asked, almost distractedly. When the official answered yes, Professor Andover reached into the inside of his light cotton jacket and pulled out a small, metal case. From this case, he removed a single paper card of purest black, embossed with an emerald green \"Delta\" symbol and a capital \"Y\" of gold in the center of that hollow triangle. \"I have been in contact with Comrade Vo for the last six months, planning this expedition as an act of cooperation between our two governments and as a boon for my University. He knows that card; show it or describe it to him... you maywant to run it by General Tran as well. Either way, they will give you the answer you need.\"As the bureaucrat took the card and then as the Border Defense sergeant took it from him and headed out of the room, Joesph wondered about his professor and the oddities that surrounded him. The first time he had ever seen the Professor, it had been in his High School Auditorium as Marie had performed the Stork Dance... and Joseph had noticed strange things. In their senior year of High School, both he and Marie had received reference letters to Miskatonic University in Arkham, a town in Essex county. When he had arrived at Miskatonic (without Marie), he had been shocked that the professor for his Cultural Anthropology class was not only the one who had given him his reference but was also the man who had he had seen three years before.And then there were his classmates, three of whom had also come on this expedition. Many of them had received similar letters from Prof. Andover and most of those, though not relaying specifics, had said that they had found the circumstances equally strange. Two who had gotten references were on this very trip with them. The first was Tracy Williams from the farm country of Northwest Virginia, a girl with blond hair quite a few shades lighter than Josephs own brassy brown and the class Nippon-Nut, being both obsessed with Anime and Manga as well as being Japanese-proficient. The second was Albert Noyes, a young man who has part white, part black and a little Algonquin-Indian from a small hamlet in southern Vermont. His specialties were technology, math and Mandarin Chinese. The third member of retinue was a young man named Malone who... frankly, was a mystery to the entire class. However, he had volunteered for this trip and his grades had been excellent so his place on the roster had been assured.But there was still a nagging question at the back of his mind: why? Why had they received offers to go to an obscure if admittedly exceptional regional university when the big names had all passed them over? Why had they been gathered from all across the United States by a single professor? And why, it seemed, did it feel like there was such a big connection between the missing member of Dr. Andovers \"collection\" and the reason behind this expedition?Why did it feel as if Marie was somehow connected to this?Eventually, the sergeant came back and informed the bureaucrat of General Vos express permission for the Professor and his students to enter the exclusion zone as well as General Trans confirmation, before handing the card back to Neville Andover. Joseph knew that academics could sometimes have friends in high and unusual places, but counting on ... no, expecting the approval of not just one, but two ranking Generals in a non-allied nation? This seemed crazy, certifiably insane even.But then, so did spectral storks and spoonbills.Northernmost Quang Binh Province, Socialist Republic of VietnamJune 29, 2011Despite the calm look on the professors face, something about the current situation made Joseph Clayton distinctly ill at ease.They had spent the last two days trudging up into the Annamite mountains after leaving the fertile coastal plain. At the last village with road access, they had ditched their vehicles and backpacked up the ridges and trails, counting on a guide from the local Bru people to lead them to... whatever Prof. Andover was looking for. The fact that the guide was now legging it quite quickly back down the misty path told Joseph that something had either gone incredibly wrong or incredibly right.Now, Neville Andover was chanting, seemingly trying to communicate with something deep in the thick underbrush on either side of the worn, overgrown gully that had been called a trail. The language was almost intellig ible to Joseph, being a form of Mon-Khmer linked to the classical Vietnamese he had studied, perhaps with a few hints of Muong intermixed. However, the syntax and grammer were archaic to say the least. From some of the words used it even seemed to be achingly familiar, almost as if...With a sudden realization of shock and the smell of grilled pork and Bac Bon Dzhow a memory in his nostrils, Joseph realized where he had encountered this form of Vietic before.But the shocks were not over.Spun around by Albert Noyes to see something, Joseph gazed upward to see a human figure standing upon the high bank, glancing down at them with hard, measuring eyes. Undoubtedly masculine, the figure was of a man of slightly darker skin than the farmers of the coast (though the features were similar) and of greater height than either them or the native Bru. Clothed only in a white cotton kilt with geometric designs in black and a leather girdle, this man carried a white flatbow decorated with bands of green, blue and red while a bronze dagger rested at his hip. His head was shaved of all hair, and black designs were tattooed from the crown of the scalp to the jawline, with more tattoos covering his arms, chest and lower legs.The fact that an arrow was nocked in the string of his bow put the four young people on edge, with Malone and Joesph himself tightening the grips on the hilts of their machetes in anticipation of a hopeless fight. More men in similar dress and tattoos, some with bronze slashing swords, some with bronze-headed spears and others with flatbows, appeared out of the forest on either side of them. Now that Joseph could get a better look at them in the dim light filtering down through the forest canopy and the mist, their arm tattoos began looking very similar to those borne by Maries parents while those on their faces, while different in design, were still similar in form.All the while, Prof. Andover kept up the low chanting, of which Joseph could pick out individual words: \"friend\", \"gods\", \"village\", \"priest\", \"comrade\" and at least one invocation of Ho Chi Minh among them. To this, these strange men seemed to confer with each other though glances and nods before took one took a short, bamboo tube from his girdle, put one end to his mouth, took a deep breath and blew.As the silvery-blue powder erupted from the tube, settled on the heads of the trekking academics and they each lost consciousness in turn, Joseph wondered if this could get any worse.Meanwhile, Spoonbill VillageTsan Pho Dao had been the Chief Priest of this village for many years, ever since the death of his father in the closing days of the American War. In that span of years, he had seen many futures and advised his people based on those futures. He had called down both ruin and plenty by invoking the power of the gods of his people. He alone, in a feat outside even the power of the hereditary village chiefs, had communicated with the Instrument of their gods, a being possessed of both boundless knowledge and an absolutely rotten temper. He also, most importantly, had an absolutely perfect memory of his entire life... and that of his father, and his father before him.To be perfectly honest, he held a tremendous amount of power within this village. The ancestor shrines belonged to families while the hunters had their own little shrines up the mountain where midnight rituals were performed to gather poison for the tips of arrows and darts. But those rituals needed to be performed by the minor priests under his command. This temple was the spiritual center of his people for most of the year and the temple with its darkened wood walls lit only by feeble braziers whose light was twisted by the smoke of rare and powerful incenses, with its figurines of gods and demons carved from nephrite and jadeite brought from deep below the earth... was his domain. His and no one else. He divined the future when possible, he performed the rites and as a result, it was he who had taken countless lives in sacrifice over the course of his adulthood: chickens, pigs, goats, buffalo... people.As he sat at a low table in his private sanctuary, trying to divine some course for a question that had faced him for most of a year, he noticed something. One of the golden discs he used for divination, a coin looted from a Chinese caravan many centuries ago, stood up on its rim and began to roll. Following the curve of failing momentum, the coin finally came to rest at a specific point on the table, a place that held indication of the future.Visitors... and not the \"ketchup\" kind of visitors.Several Hours Later, Close to the Laos BorderThe answer to Joseph Claytons earlier question was a definite yes. When he had awoken, he had found his wrists and ankles bound, the bindings looped over a pole carried by two men with him and the other students suspended like deer carcasses. The Professor, on the other hand, had not been bound, but had found transport by sitting in a large basket suspended from one of the poles by a cord, carried by a pair of men. They had been going downhill from the crest of a ridge and were now leaving the forest, coming onto a road. First, they passed under a wooden gate where roosting spoonbills had been carved into the posts and a sun flanked by two dragons had been carved into the beams above the road.Then Joseph saw where they were headed. A village of perhaps thirty houses was visible in the valley bottom while narrow terraces had been cut into the hills above, green with growing rice. The view quickly vanished as the men began heading into the village itself but sight was soon replaced with sound. The quiet of the forest was supplanted by the cacophony of a hundred sounds: chickens and pigs grunted and clucked as the animals rooted below the houses and around the garbage heaps while odd-looking reddish dogs, lazing in the sun on the porches of the outermost houses, whined in surprise at the new arrivals. The sounds of tools and primitive machinery clunked melodiously. The sounds of people also were audible: talking, laughing, shouting and even a few low notes of womens work songs were possible for Joseph to pick out of the general buzz... a buzz which also included Albert trying to reason with their captors and Tracy displaying an unusually foul mouth toward same.Soon, people began to notice the men bringing in captives and a few even began to gather along the path as they entered the village, joining their dogs (or Dholes, as they were now identifiable as) who had come to sniff. It was mostly men, older boys and children who came out to watch while the women and the elderly usually went no further than windows and the porches of the stilt-houses that lined the road. Here, even hanging upside down, Joseph could notice a few things about the dress and appearance of the peopleFrankly... it was a bit odd.From what he knew, the Vietnamese national costume (in its modern form) placed a heavy emphasis on trousers, an item of clothing that he noticed was rather conspicuously absent here. Everyone here seemed to be wearing variations on one basic outfit in either brown or black: knee-length cotton kilts, short-sleeved cotton jackets (mostly with their front fastenings closed) and either rough-woven conical hats or simple cloths tied over their heads. The mens hair appeared to be cut short to the point where one could vaguely make out the tattoos on their scalp while children varied between the same shortness for boys and a single, long braid for the girls.Eventually they arrived in a great or square before what appeared to be the temple: a ponderous structure of wood and brick perched upon massive stone foundations, its sloping roofs flaring outward as if to shroud the surrounding houses from the scrutiny of the heavens. Around them, a crowd had gathered on all sides, an air of excitement buzzing in the air. Men exited the house across the square from the temple entrance and despite the calm demeanour of Professor Andover, words began filtering through to Joseph that began sounding more and more disturbing; words like \"kill\", \"sacrifice\" and \"ritual\". But another word came, one that sent darker imaginings and images rambling through his sensation-saturated mind.The word \"eat\".\"WAIT! STOP!\"Joseph knew those words as well... as well as that voice!Out of the crowd rushed a figure dressed much like the others: brown kilt and jacket, the latter partially open to reveal a yem undergarment and with a straw hat on her head. As Joseph finally began taking in other details, he noticed the tattooed lines and whimsical designs on her lower legs and arms and on her face, lines and vaguely triangular patterns that almost resembled the features of an orangutan.Her face... behind all the tattooing, the face of this woman was still as unmistakable to Joseph as the first day they had met in Kindergarten. To this sudden recognition, the young man could only exclaim his surprise as a soothingly familiar name.\"Marie?\"", "Ordinarily, one wouldnt think of the Dreamers Inn as a mausoleum any more than one would think of the Golden Goose restaurant as a crypt. Journeymen who are just passing through Leight, and rooming at the Inn as a matter of convenience, will see nothing amiss. There are a few splintering floorboards here, and a couple of sagging roof beams there, but these things are only natural for a lodging house thats stood for more than two centuries. I, however, with my wary eyes and cautious steps, notice more ominous flaws: the dry rot in the walls, for instance, and the stairs that are almost murderously steep. How on Earth does Monsieur Thènard keep the Inn open despite its decay and stale air? Perhaps he himself has had a part in spreading rumors about it, challenging brave visitors to spend the entire night in a haunted hotel.Then again, maybe it all boils down to the Inn being the most immediate place for a nights slumber. When one is tired and hungry, weary from sitting in a carriage or on horseback, then why not stay here?\"Good evening, Mademoiselle Dawson,\" announces an oily voice. \"Welcome to the Dreamers Inn.\"My spine stiffens. If this place is a tomb, then Monsieur Thènard is the shifty undertaker whod give you your six feet of earth once you had passed, then dig you up if your relatives couldnt pay the maintenance fees. His smile resembles a scythes blade: the one that Death wields, and with which he harvests you.\"Good evening to you too, Monsieur Thènard,\" I tell him as civilly as I can. \"Id like to rent a room, please.\"\"Certainly.\" He pauses. \"I am surprised to see you here. Can you not stay at your fathers house for free?\"\"Of course, but I have my reasons. If you must know, Im on an errand to quell all the rumors about this hotel. You and I could both stand to have more revenue coming from it, after all. What better way to do that than to put vicious village talk to rest? You know what the people say: its haunted, and not by your ordinary ghosts. They also claim that certain people, once they lie down to sleep here, never awaken. Pah! If someone wakes up dead, pardon the silly expression, then their heart failed during the night, or they perished from some other natural cause. No devilry is here, and Im out to prove it once and for all.\"\"Mais oui,\" he says, grinning. \"We two know that, but how are you going to convince the rest of Leight?\"\"I intend to spend three consecutive nights here, not just one, and come out none the worse for wear. I know that the people here typically dont listen to a godless spinster. However, if I tell them that theres nothing to fear at the Dreamers Inn - save a few usual nightmares from sleeping in a strange place - perhaps they will take heed, and tell their traveling friends and relatives to pay this establishment a visit.\"\"A splendid plan,\" Thènard replies. \"I hope it works, and here is the cost of three nights lodging.\" When he reveals it, I wince. Its not exorbitant, meaning that I can still afford it, but barely. With Theodora receiving her months wages yesterday, plus my paying an ample bill of goods from the grocer, Ill be spent out by the end of my stay. Im glad that its almost the end of October: Halloween will arrive in exactly three days. Once its November, my monthly pension allowance will be full again, and I can start all over.Still, I feel like a fool. Truly, is there any starting over when one keeps going round in the same circle?\"Mademoiselle?\" Startled out of my reverie, I pay him. \"Agathe is still serving food in the kitchen,\" Thènard tells me, referring to his wizened maid-of-all-work. \"There arent enough guests for her to have served dinner in the dining room, so Im glad youve come.\" All of a sudden, he leans forward and winks at me. \"Should you require company upstairs…\"\"Give me my key, and Ill be off.\"He opens a drawer behind his porters desk and hands it over, smirking. \"Room two, second floor.\""]}

The Professor, on the other hand, had not been bound, but had found transport by sitting in a large basket suspended from one of the poles by a cord, carried by a pair of men. They had been going downhill from the crest of a ridge and were now leaving the forest, coming onto a road. First, they passed under a wooden gate where roosting spoonbills had been carved into the posts and a sun flanked by two dragons had been carved into the beams above the road.Then Joseph saw where they were headed. A village of perhaps thirty houses was visible in the valley bottom while narrow terraces had been cut into the hills above, green with growing rice. The view quickly vanished as the men began heading into the village itself but sight was soon replaced with sound. The quiet of the forest was supplanted by the cacophony of a hundred sounds: chickens and pigs grunted and clucked as the animals rooted below the houses and around the garbage heaps while odd-looking reddish dogs, lazing in the sun on the porches of the outermost houses, whined in surprise at the new arrivals. The sounds of tools and primitive machinery clunked melodiously. The sounds of people also were audible: talking, laughing, shouting and even a few low notes of womens work songs were possible for Joseph to pick out of the general buzz... a buzz which also included Albert trying to reason with their captors and Tracy displaying an unusually foul mouth toward same.Soon, people began to notice the men bringing in captives and a few even began to gather along the path as they entered the village, joining their dogs (or Dholes, as they were now identifiable as) who had come to sniff. It was mostly men, older boys and children who came out to watch while the women and the elderly usually went no further than windows and the porches of the stilt-houses that lined the road. Here, even hanging upside down, Joseph could notice a few things about the dress and appearance of the peopleFrankly... it was a bit odd.From what he knew, the Vietnamese national costume (in its modern form) placed a heavy emphasis on trousers, an item of clothing that he noticed was rather conspicuously absent here. Everyone here seemed to be wearing variations on one basic outfit in either brown or black: knee-length cotton kilts, short-sleeved cotton jackets (mostly with their front fastenings closed) and either rough-woven conical hats or simple cloths tied over their heads. The mens hair appeared to be cut short to the point where one could vaguely make out the tattoos on their scalp while children varied between the same shortness for boys and a single, long braid for the girls.Eventually they arrived in a great or square before what appeared to be the temple: a ponderous structure of wood and brick perched upon massive stone foundations, its sloping roofs flaring outward as if to shroud the surrounding houses from the scrutiny of the heavens. Around them, a crowd had gathered on all sides, an air of excitement buzzing in the air. Men exited the house across the square from the temple entrance and despite the calm demeanour of Professor Andover, words began filtering through to Joseph that began sounding more and more disturbing; words like \"kill\", \"sacrifice\" and \"ritual\". But another word came, one that sent darker imaginings and images rambling through his sensation-saturated mind.The word \"eat\".\"WAIT! STOP!\"Joseph knew those words as well... as well as that voice!Out of the crowd rushed a figure dressed much like the others: brown kilt and jacket, the latter partially open to reveal a yem undergarment and with a straw hat on her head. As Joseph finally began taking in other details, he noticed the tattooed lines and whimsical designs on her lower legs and arms and on her face, lines and vaguely triangular patterns that almost resembled the features of an orangutan.Her face... behind all the tattooing, the face of this woman was still as unmistakable to Joseph as the first day they had met in Kindergarten. To this sudden recognition, the young man could only exclaim his surprise as a soothingly familiar name.\"Marie?\"", "IX.Friday morning Armitage, Rice, and Morgan set out by motor for Dunwich, arriving at the village about one in the afternoon. The day was pleasant, but even in the brightest sunlight a kind of quiet dread and portent seemed to hover about the strangely domed hills and the deep, shadowy ravines of the stricken region. Now and then on some mountain-top a gaunt circle of stones could be glimpsed against the sky. From the air of hushed fright at Osborn’s store they knew something hideous had happened, and soon learned of the annihilation of the Elmer Frye house and family. Throughout that afternoon they rode around Dunwich; questioning the natives concerning all that had occurred, and seeing for themselves with rising pangs of horror the drear Frye ruins with their lingering traces of the tarry stickiness, the blasphemous tracks in the Frye yard, the wounded Seth Bishop cattle, and the enormous swaths of disturbed vegetation in various places. The trail up and down Sentinel Hill seemed to Armitage of almost cataclysmic significance, and he looked long at the sinister altar-like stone on the summit.      At length the visitors, apprised of a party of State Police which had come from Aylesbury that morning in response to the first telephone reports of the Frye tragedy, decided to seek out the officers and compare notes as far as practicable. This, however, they found more easily planned than performed; since no sign of the party could be found in any direction. There had been five of them in a car, but now the car stood empty near the ruins in the Frye yard. The natives, all of whom had talked with the policemen, seemed at first as perplexed as Armitage and his companions. Then old Sam Hutchins thought of something and turned pale, nudging Fred Farr and pointing to the dank, deep hollow that yawned close by.      “Gawd,” he gasped, “I telled ’em not ter go daown into the glen, an’ I never thought nobody’d dew it with them tracks an’ that smell an’ the whippoorwills a-screechin’ daown thar in the dark o’ noonday. . . .”      A cold shudder ran through natives and visitors alike, and every ear seemed strained in a kind of instinctive, unconscious listening. Armitage, now that he had actually come upon the horror and its monstrous work, trembled with the responsibility he felt to be his. Night would soon fall, and it was then that the mountainous blasphemy lumbered upon its eldritch course. Negotium perambulans in tenebris. . . . The old librarian rehearsed the formulae he had memorised, and clutched the paper containing the alternative one he had not memorised. He saw that his electric flashlight was in working order. Rice, beside him, took from a valise a metal sprayer of the sort used in combating insects; whilst Morgan uncased the big-game rifle on which he relied despite his colleague’s warnings that no material weapon would be of help.      Armitage, having read the hideous diary, knew painfully well what kind of a manifestation to expect; but he did not add to the fright of the Dunwich people by giving any hints or clues. He hoped that it might be conquered without any revelation to the world of the monstrous thing it had escaped. As the shadows gathered, the natives commenced to disperse homeward, anxious to bar themselves indoors despite the present evidence that all human locks and bolts were useless before a force that could bend trees and crush houses when it chose. They shook their heads at the visitors’ plan to stand guard at the Frye ruins near the glen; and as they left, had little expectancy of ever seeing the watchers again.      There were rumblings under the hills that night, and the whippoorwills piped threateningly. Once in a while a wind, sweeping up out of Cold Spring Glen, would bring a touch of ineffable foetor to the heavy night air; such a foetor as all three of the watchers had smelled once before, when they stood above a dying thing that had passed for fifteen years and a half as a human being. But the looked-for terror did not appear. Whatever was down there in the glen was biding its time, and Armitage told his colleagues it would be suicidal to try to attack it in the dark.      Morning came wanly, and the night-sounds ceased. It was a grey, bleak day, with now and then a drizzle of rain; and heavier and heavier clouds seemed to be piling themselves up beyond the hills to the northwest. The men from Arkham were undecided what to do. Seeking shelter from the increasing rainfall beneath one of the few undestroyed Frye outbuildings, they debated the wisdom of waiting, or of taking the aggressive and going down into the glen in quest of their nameless, monstrous quarry. The downpour waxed in heaviness, and distant peals of thunder sounded from far horizons. Sheet lightning shimmered, and then a forky bolt flashed near at hand, as if descending into the accursed glen itself. The sky grew very dark, and the watchers hoped that the storm would prove a short, sharp one followed by clear weather.      It was still gruesomely dark when, not much over an hour later, a confused babel of voices sounded down the road. Another moment brought to view a frightened group of more than a dozen men, running, shouting, and even whimpering hysterically. Someone in the lead began sobbing out words, and the Arkham men started violently when those words developed a coherent form.      “Oh, my Gawd, my Gawd,” the voice choked out. “It’s a-goin’ agin, an’ this time by day! It’s aout—it’s aout an’ a-movin’ this very minute, an’ only the Lord knows when it’ll be on us all!”      The speaker panted into silence, but another took up his message.      “Nigh on a haour ago Zeb Whateley here heerd the ’phone a-ringin’, an’ it was Mis’ Corey, George’s wife, that lives daown by the junction. She says the hired boy Luther was aout drivin’ in the caows from the storm arter the big bolt, when he see all the trees a-bendin’ at the maouth o’ the glen—opposite side ter this—an’ smelt the same awful smell like he smelt when he faound the big tracks las’ Monday mornin’. An’ she says he says they was a swishin’, lappin’ saound, more nor what the bendin’ trees an’ bushes could make, an’ all on a suddent the trees along the rud begun ter git pushed one side, an’ they was a awful stompin’ an’ splashin’ in the mud. But mind ye, Luther he didn’t see nothin’ at all, only just the bendin’ trees an’ underbrush.      “Then fur ahead where Bishop’s Brook goes under the rud he heerd a awful creakin’ an’ strainin’ on the bridge, an’ says he could tell the saound o’ wood a-startin’ to crack an’ split. An’ all the whiles he never see a thing, only them trees an’ bushes a-bendin’. An’ when the swishin’ saound got very fur off—on the rud towards Wizard Whateley’s an’ Sentinel Hill—Luther he had the guts ter step up whar he’d heerd it furst an’ look at the graound. It was all mud an’ water, an’ the sky was dark, an’ the rain was wipin’ aout all tracks abaout as fast as could be; but beginnin’ at the glen maouth, whar the trees had moved, they was still some o’ them awful prints big as bar’ls like he seen Monday.”      At this point the first excited speaker interrupted.      “But that ain’t the trouble naow—that was only the start. Zeb here was callin’ folks up an’ everybody was a-listenin’ in when a call from Seth Bishop’s cut in. His haousekeeper Sally was carryin’ on fit ter kill—she’d jest seed the trees a-bendin’ beside the rud, an’ says they was a kind o’ mushy saound, like a elephant puffin’ an’ treadin’, a-headin’ fer the haouse. Then she up an’ spoke suddent of a fearful smell, an’ says her boy Cha’ncey was a-screamin’ as haow it was jest like what he smelt up to the Whateley rewins Monday mornin’. An’ the dogs was all barkin’ an’ whinin’ awful.      “An’ then she let aout a turrible yell, an’ says the shed daown the rud had jest caved in like the storm hed blowed it over, only the wind wa’n’t strong enough to dew that. Everybody was a-listenin’, an’ we could hear lots o’ folks on the wire a-gaspin’. All to onct Sally she yelled agin, an’ says the front yard picket fence hed just crumbled up, though they wa’n’t no sign o’ what done it. Then everybody on the line could hear Cha’ncey an’ ol’ Seth Bishop a-yellin’ tew, an’ Sally was shriekin’ aout that suthin’ heavy hed struck the haouse—not lightnin’ nor nothin’, but suthin’ heavy agin the front, that kep’ a-launchin’ itself agin an’ agin, though ye couldn’t see nothin’ aout the front winders. An’ then . . . an’ then . . .”      Lines of fright deepened on every face; and Armitage, shaken as he was, had barely poise enough to prompt the speaker.      “An’ then . . . Sally she yelled aout, ’O help, the haouse is a-cavin’ in’ . . . an’ on the wire we could hear a turrible crashin’, an’ a hull flock o’ screamin’ . . . jest like when Elmer Frye’s place was took, only wuss. . . .”      The man paused, and another of the crowd spoke.      “That’s all—not a saound nor squeak over the ’phone arter that. Jest still-like. We that heerd it got aout Fords an’ wagons an’ raounded up as many able-bodied menfolks as we could git, at Corey’s place, an’ come up here ter see what yew thought best ter dew. Not but what I think it’s the Lord’s jedgment fer our iniquities, that no mortal kin ever set aside.”      Armitage saw that the time for positive action had come, and spoke decisively to the faltering group of frightened rustics.      “We must follow it, boys.” He made his voice as reassuring as possible. “I believe there’s a chance of putting it out of business. You men know that those Whateleys were wizards—well, this thing is a thing of wizardry, and must be put down by the same means. I’ve seen Wilbur Whateley’s diary and read some of the strange old books he used to read; and I think I know the right kind of spell to recite to make the thing fade away. Of course, one can’t be sure, but we can always take a chance. It’s invisible—I knew it would be—but there’s a powder in this long-distance sprayer that might make it shew up for a second. Later on we’ll try it. It’s a frightful thing to have alive, but it isn’t as bad as what Wilbur would have let in if he’d lived longer. You’ll never know what the world has escaped. Now we’ve only this one thing to fight, and it can’t multiply. It can, though, do a lot of harm; so we mustn’t hesitate to rid the community of it.      “We must follow it—and the way to begin is to go to the place that has just been wrecked. Let somebody lead the way—I don’t know your roads very well, but I’ve an idea there might be a shorter cut across lots. How about it?”      The men shuffled about a moment, and then Earl Sawyer spoke softly, pointing with a grimy finger through the steadily lessening rain.      “I guess ye kin git to Seth Bishop’s quickest by cuttin’ acrost the lower medder here, wadin’ the brook at the low place, an’ climbin’ through Carrier’s mowin’ and the timber-lot beyont. That comes aout on the upper rud mighty nigh Seth’s—a leetle t’other side.”      Armitage, with Rice and Morgan, started to walk in the direction indicated; and most of the natives followed slowly. The sky was growing lighter, and there were signs that the storm had worn itself away. When Armitage inadvertently took a wrong direction, Joe Osborn warned him and walked ahead to shew the right one. Courage and confidence were mounting; though the twilight of the almost perpendicular wooded hill which lay toward the end of their short cut, and among whose fantastic ancient trees they had to scramble as if up a ladder, put these qualities to a severe test.      At length they emerged on a muddy road to find the sun coming out. They were a little beyond the Seth Bishop place, but bent trees and hideously unmistakable tracks shewed what had passed by. Only a few moments were consumed in surveying the ruins just around the bend. It was the Frye incident all over again, and nothing dead or living was found in either of the collapsed shells which had been the Bishop house and barn. No one cared to remain there amidst the stench and tarry stickiness, but all turned instinctively to the line of horrible prints leading on toward the wrecked Whateley farmhouse and the altar-crowned slopes of Sentinel Hill.      As the men passed the site of Wilbur Whateley’s abode they shuddered visibly, and seemed again to mix hesitancy with their zeal. It was no joke tracking down something as big as a house that one could not see, but that had all the vicious malevolence of a daemon. Opposite the base of Sentinel Hill the tracks left the road, and there was a fresh bending and matting visible along the broad swath marking the monster’s former route to and from the summit.      Armitage produced a pocket telescope of considerable power and scanned the steep green side of the hill. Then he handed the instrument to Morgan, whose sight was keener. After a moment of gazing Morgan cried out sharply, passing the glass to Earl Sawyer and indicating a certain spot on the slope with his finger. Sawyer, as clumsy as most non-users of optical devices are, fumbled a while; but eventually focussed the lenses with Armitage’s aid. When he did so his cry was less restrained than Morgan’s had been.      “Gawd almighty, the grass an’ bushes is a-movin’! It’s a-goin’ up—slow-like—creepin’ up ter the top this minute, heaven only knows what fur!”      Then the germ of panic seemed to spread among the seekers. It was one thing to chase the nameless entity, but quite another to find it. Spells might be all right—but suppose they weren’t? Voices began questioning Armitage about what he knew of the thing, and no reply seemed quite to satisfy. Everyone seemed to feel himself in close proximity to phases of Nature and of being utterly forbidden, and wholly outside the sane experience of mankind."]}
{"id": "EN011", "pair": ["IV. A Mutation and a Madness1.In the week following that memorable Good Friday Charles Ward was seen more often than usual, and was continually carrying books between his library and the attic laboratory. His actions were quiet and rational, but he had a furtive, hunted look which his mother did not like, and developed an incredibly ravenous appetite as gauged by his demands upon the cook. Dr. Willett had been told of those Friday noises and happenings, and on the following Tuesday had a long conversation with the youth in the library where the picture stared no more. The interview was, as always, inconclusive; but Willett is still ready to swear that the youth was sane and himself at the time. He held out promises of an early revelation, and spoke of the need of securing a laboratory elsewhere. At the loss of the portrait he grieved singularly little considering his first enthusiasm over it, but seemed to find something of positive humour in its sudden crumbling.      About the second week Charles began to be absent from the house for long periods, and one day when good old black Hannah came to help with the spring cleaning she mentioned his frequent visits to the old house in Olney Court, where he would come with a large valise and perform curious delvings in the cellar. He was always very liberal to her and to old Asa, but seemed more worried than he used to be; which grieved her very much, since she had watched him grow up from birth. Another report of his doings came from Pawtuxet, where some friends of the family saw him at a distance a surprising number of times. He seemed to haunt the resort and canoe-house of Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet, and subsequent inquiries by Dr. Willett at that place brought out the fact that his purpose was always to secure access to the rather hedged-in river-bank, along which he would walk toward the north, usually not reappearing for a very long while.      Late in May came a momentary revival of ritualistic sounds in the attic laboratory which brought a stern reproof from Mr. Ward and a somewhat distracted promise of amendment from Charles. It occurred one morning, and seemed to form a resumption of the imaginary conversation noted on that turbulent Good Friday. The youth was arguing or remonstrating hotly with himself, for there suddenly burst forth a perfectly distinguishable series of clashing shouts in differentiated tones like alternate demands and denials which caused Mrs. Ward to run upstairs and listen at the door. She could hear no more than a fragment whose only plain words were \"must have it red for three months\", and upon her knocking all sounds ceased at once. When Charles was later questioned by his father he said that there were certain conflicts of spheres of consciousness which only great skill could avoid, but which he would try to transfer to other realms.      About the middle of June a queer nocturnal incident occurred. In the early evening there had been some noise and thumping in the laboratory upstairs, and Mr. Ward was on the point of investigating when it suddenly quieted down. That midnight, after the family had retired, the butler was nightlocking the front door when according to his statement Charles appeared somewhat blunderingly and uncertainly at the foot of the stairs with a large suitcase and made signs that he wished egress. The youth spoke no word, but the worthy Yorkshireman caught one sight of his fevered eyes and trembled causelessly. He opened the door and young Ward went out, but in the morning he presented his resignation to Mrs. Ward. There was, he said, something unholy in the glance Charles had fixed on him. It was no way for a young gentleman to look at an honest person, and he could not possibly stay another night. Mrs. Ward allowed the man to depart, but she did not value his statement highly. To fancy Charles in a savage state that night was quite ridiculous, for as long as she had remained awake she had heard faint sounds from the laboratory above; sounds as if of sobbing and pacing, and of a sighing which told only of despairs profoundest depths. Mrs. Ward had grown used to listening for sounds in the night, for the mystery of her son was fast driving all else from her mind.      The next evening, much as on another evening nearly three months before, Charles Ward seized the newspaper very early and accidentally lost the main section. The matter was not recalled till later, when Dr. Willett began checking up loose ends and searching out missing links here and there. In the Journal office he found the section which Charles had lost, and marked two items as of possible significance. They were as follows:More Cemetery DelvingIt was this morning discovered by Robert Hart, night watchman at the North Burial Ground, that ghouls were again at work in the ancient portion of the cemetery. The grave of Ezra Weeden, who was born in 1740 and died in 1824, according to his uprooted and savagely splintered slate headstone, was found excavated and rifled, the work being evidently done with a spade stolen from an adjacent tool-shed.      Whatever the contents may have been after more than a century of burial, all was gone except a few slivers of decayed wood. There were no wheel tracks, but the police have measured a single set of footprints which they found in the vicinity, and which indicate the boots of a man of refinement.      Hart is inclined to link this incident with the digging discovered last March, when a party in a motor truck were frightened away after making a deep excavation; but Sergt. Riley of the Second Station discounts this theory and points to vital differences in the two cases. In March the digging had been in a spot where no grave was known; but this time a well-marked and cared-for grave had been rifled with every evidence of deliberate purpose, and with a conscious malignity expressed in the splintering of the slab which had been intact up to the day before.      Members of the Weeden family, notified of the happening, expressed their astonishment and regret; and were wholly unable to think of any enemy who would care to violate the grave of their ancestor. Hazard Weeden of 598 Angell Street recalls a family legend according to which Ezra Weeden was involved in some very peculiar circumstances, not dishonourable to himself, shortly before the Revolution; but of any modern feud or mystery he is frankly ignorant. Inspector Cunningham has been assigned to the case, and hopes to uncover some valuable clues in the near future.Dogs Noisy in Pawtuxet      Residents of Pawtuxet were aroused about 3 a.m. today by a phenomenal baying of dogs which seemed to centre near the river just north of Rhodes-on-the-Pawtuxet. The volume and quality of the howling were unusually odd, according to most who heard it; and Fred Lemdin, night watchman at Rhodes, declares it was mixed with something very like the shrieks of a man in mortal terror and agony. A sharp and very brief thunderstorm, which seemed to strike somewhere near the bank of the river, put an end to the disturbance. Strange and unpleasant odours, probably from the oil tanks along the bay, are popularly linked with this incident; and may have had their share in exciting the dogs.      The aspect of Charles now became very haggard and hunted, and all agreed in retrospect that he may have wished at this period to make some statement or confession from which sheer terror withheld him. The morbid listening of his mother in the night brought out the fact that he made frequent sallies abroad under cover of darkness, and most of the more academic alienists unite at present in charging him with the revolting cases of vampirism which the press so sensationally reported about this time, but which have not yet been definitely traced to any known perpetrator. These cases, too recent and celebrated to need detailed mention, involved victims of every age and type and seemed to cluster around two distinct localities; the residential hill and the North End, near the Ward home, and the suburban districts across the Cranston line near Pawtuxet. Both late wayfarers and sleepers with open windows were attacked, and those who lived to tell the tale spoke unanimously of a lean, lithe, leaping monster with burning eyes which fastened its teeth in the throat or upper arm and feasted ravenously.      Dr. Willett, who refuses to date the madness of Charles Ward as far back as even this, is cautious in attempting to explain these horrors. He has, he declares, certain theories of his own; and limits his positive statements to a peculiar kind of negation. \"I will not,\" he says, \"state who or what I believe perpetrated these attacks and murders, but I will declare that Charles Ward was innocent of them. I have reason to be sure he was ignorant of the taste of blood, as indeed his continued anaemic decline and increasing pallor prove better than any verbal argument. Ward meddled with terrible things, but he has paid for it, and he was never a monster or a villain. As for now - I dont like to think. A change came, and Im content to believe that the old Charles Ward died with it. His soul did, anyhow, for that mad flesh that vanished from Waites hospital had another.\"      Willett speaks with authority, for he was often at the Ward home attending Mrs. Ward, whose nerves had begun to snap under the strain. Her nocturnal listening had bred some morbid hallucinations which she confided to the doctor with hesitancy, and which he ridiculed in talking to her, although they made him ponder deeply when alone. These delusions always concerned the faint sounds which she fancied she heard in the attic laboratory and bedroom, and emphasised the occurrence of muffled sighs and sobbings at the most impossible times. Early in July Willett ordered Mrs. Ward to Atlantic City for an indefinite recuperative sojourn, and cautioned both Mr. Ward and the haggard and elusive Charles to write her only cheering letters. It is probably to this enforced and reluctant escape that she owes her life and continued sanity.2.      Not long after his mothers departure Charles Ward began negotiating for the Pawtuxet bungalow. It was a squalid little wooden edifice with a concrete garage, perched high on the sparsely settled bank of the river slightly above Rhodes, but for some odd reason the youth would have nothing else. He gave the real-estate agencies no peace till one of them secured it for him at an exorbitant price from a somewhat reluctant owner, and as soon as it was vacant he took possession under cover of darkness, transporting in a great closed van the entire contents of his attic laboratory, including the books both weird and modern which he had borrowed from his study. He had this van loaded in the black small hours, and his father recalls only a drowsy realisation of stifled oaths and stamping feet on the night the goods were taken away. After that Charles moved back to his own old quarters on the third floor, and never haunted the attic again.      To the Pawtuxet bungalow Charles transferred all the secrecy with which he had surrounded his attic realm, save that he now appeared to have two sharers of his mysteries; a villainous-looking Portuguese half-caste from the South Main St. waterfront who acted as a servant, and a thin, scholarly stranger with dark glasses and a stubbly full beard of dyed aspect whose status was evidently that of a colleague. Neighbours vainly tried to engage these odd persons in conversation. The mulatto Gomes spoke very little English, and the bearded man, who gave his name as Dr. Allen, voluntarily followed his example. Ward himself tried to be more affable, but succeeded only in provoking curiosity with his rambling accounts of chemical research. Before long queer tales began to circulate regarding the all-night burning of lights; and somewhat later, after this burning had suddenly ceased, there rose still queerer tales of disproportionate orders of meat from the butchers and of the muffled shouting, declamation, rhythmic chanting, and screaming supposed to come from some very deep cellar below the place. Most distinctly the new and strange household was bitterly disliked by the honest bourgeoisie of the vicinity, and it is not remarkable that dark hints were advanced connecting the hated establishment with the current epidemic of vampiristic attacks and murders; especially since the radius of that plague seemed now confined wholly to Pawtuxet and the adjacent streets of Edgewood.      Ward spent most of his time at the bungalow, but slept occasionally at home and was still reckoned a dweller beneath his fathers roof. Twice he was absent from the city on week-long trips, whose destinations have not yet been discovered. He grew steadily paler and more emaciated even than before, and lacked some of his former assurance when repeating to Dr. Willett his old, old story of vital research and future revelations. Willett often waylaid him at his fathers house, for the elder Ward was deeply worried and perplexed, and wished his son to get as much sound oversight as could be managed in the case of so secretive and independent an adult. The doctor still insists that the youth was sane even as late as this, and adduces many a conversation to prove his point.      About September the vampirism declined, but in the following January Ward almost became involved in serious trouble. For some time the nocturnal arrival and departure of motor trucks at the Pawtuxet bungalow had been commented upon, and at this juncture an unforeseen hitch exposed the nature of at least one item of their contents. In a lonely spot near Hope Valley had occurred one of the frequent sordid waylayings of trucks by \"hi-jackers\" in quest of liquor shipments, but this time the robbers had been destined to receive the greater shock. For the long cases they seized proved upon opening to contain some exceedingly gruesome things; so gruesome, in fact, that the matter could not be kept quiet amongst the denizens of the underworld. The thieves had hastily buried what they discovered, but when the State Police got wind of the matter a careful search was made. A recently arrested vagrant, under promise of immunity from prosecution on any additional charge, at last consented to guide a party of troopers to the spot; and there was found in that hasty cache a very hideous and shameful thing. It would not be well for the national - or even the international - sense of decorum if the public were ever to know what was uncovered by that awestruck party. There was no mistaking it, even by these far from studious officers; and telegrams to Washington ensued with feverish rapidity.      The cases were addressed to Charles Ward at his Pawtuxet bungalow, and State and Federal officials at once paid him a very forceful and serious call. They found him pallid and worried with his two odd companions, and received from him what seemed to be a valid explanation and evidence of innocence. He had needed certain anatomical specimens as part of a programme of research whose depth and genuineness anyone who had known him in the last decade could prove, and had ordered the required kind and number from agencies which he had thought as reasonably legitimate as such things can be. Of the identity of the specimens he had known absolutely nothing, and was properly shocked when the inspectors hinted at the monstrous effect on public sentiment and national dignity which a knowledge of the matter would produce. In this statement he was firmly sustained by his bearded colleague Dr. Allen, whose oddly hollow voice carried even more conviction than his own nervous tones; so that in the end the officials took no action, but carefully set down the New York name and address which Ward gave them as a basis for a search which came to nothing. It is only fair to add that the specimens were quickly and quietly restored to their proper places, and that the general public will never know of their blasphemous disturbance.      On February 9, 1928, Dr. Willett received a letter from Charles Ward which he considers of extraordinary importance, and about which he has frequently quarrelled with Dr. Lyman. Lyman believes that this note contains positive proof of a well-developed case of dementia praecox, but Willett on the other hand regards it as the last perfectly sane utterance of the hapless youth. He calls especial attention to the normal character of the penmanship; which though shewing traces of shattered nerves, is nevertheless distinctly Wards own. The text in full is as follows:\"100 Prospect St.            Providence, R.I.,      February 8, 1928.\"Dear Dr. Willett: -       \"I feel that at last the time has come for me to make the disclosures which I have so long promised you, and for which you have pressed me so often. The patience you have shewn in waiting, and the confidence you have shewn in my mind and integrity, are things I shall never cease to appreciate.      \"And now that I am ready to speak, I must own with humiliation that no triumph such as I dreamed of can ever be mine. Instead of triumph I have found terror, and my talk with you will not be a boast of victory but a plea for help and advice in saving both myself and the world from a horror beyond all human conception or calculation. You recall what those Fenner letters said of the old raiding party at Pawtuxet. That must all be done again, and quickly. Upon us depends more than can be put into words - all civilisation, all natural law, perhaps even the fate of the solar system and the universe. I have brought to light a monstrous abnormality, but I did it for the sake of knowledge. Now for the sake of all life and Nature you must help me thrust it back into the dark again.      \"I have left that Pawtuxet place forever, and we must extirpate everything existing there, alive or dead. I shall not go there again, and you must not believe it if you ever hear that I am there. I will tell you why I say this when I see you. I have come home for good, and wish you would call on me at the very first moment that you can spare five or six hours continuously to hear what I have to say. It will take that long - and believe me when I tell you that you never had a more genuine professional duty than this. My life and reason are the very least things which hang in the balance.      \"I dare not tell my father, for he could not grasp the whole thing. But I have told him of my danger, and he has four men from a detective agency watching the house. I dont know how much good they can do, for they have against them forces which even you could scarcely envisage or acknowledge. So come quickly if you wish to see me alive and hear how you may help to save the cosmos from stark hell.      \"Any time will do - I shall not be out of the house. Dont telephone ahead, for there is no telling who or what may try to intercept you. And let us pray to whatever gods there be that nothing may prevent this meeting.      \"In utmost gravity and desperation,\"Charles Dexter Ward.\"      \"P.S. Shoot Dr. Allen on sight and dissolve his body in acid. Dont burn it.\"      Dr. Willett received this note about 10:30 a.m., and immediately arranged to spare the whole late afternoon and evening for the momentous talk, letting it extend on into the night as long as might be necessary. He planned to arrive about four oclock, and through all the intervening hours was so engulfed in every sort of wild speculation that most of his tasks were very mechanically performed. Maniacal as the letter would have sounded to a stranger, Willett had seen too much of Charles Wards oddities to dismiss it as sheer raving. That something very subtle, ancient, and horrible was hovering about he felt quite sure, and the reference to Dr. Allen could almost be comprehended in view of what Pawtuxet gossip said of Wards enigmatical colleague. Willett had never seen the man, but had heard much of his aspect and bearing, and could not but wonder what sort of eyes those much-discussed dark glasses might conceal.      Promptly at four Dr. Willett presented himself at the Ward residence, but found to his annoyance that Charles had not adhered to his determination to remain indoors. The guards were there, but said that the young man seemed to have lost part of his timidity. He had that morning done much apparently frightened arguing and protesting over the telephone, one of the detectives said, replying to some unknown voice with phrases such as \"I am very tired and must rest a while\", \"I cant receive anyone for some time, youll have to excuse me\", \"Please postpone decisive action till we can arrange some sort of compromise\", or \"I am very sorry, but I must take a complete vacation from everything; Ill talk with you later\". Then, apparently gaining boldness through meditation, he had slipped out so quietly that no one had seen him depart or knew that he had gone until he returned about one oclock and entered the house without a word. He had gone upstairs, where a bit of his fear must have surged back; for he was heard to cry out in a highly terrified fashion upon entering his library, afterward trailing off into a kind of choking gasp. When, however, the butler had gone to inquire what the trouble was, he had appeared at the door with a great show of boldness, and had silently gestured the man away in a manner that terrified him unaccountably. Then he had evidently done some rearranging of his shelves, for a great clattering and thumping and creaking ensued; after which he had reappeared and left at once. Willett inquired whether or not any message had been left, but was told that there was none. The butler seemed queerly disturbed about something in Charless appearance and manner, and asked solicitously if there was much hope for a cure of his disordered nerves.      For almost two hours Dr. Willett waited vainly in Charles Wards library, watching the dusty shelves with their wide gaps where books had been removed, and smiling grimly at the panelled overmantel on the north wall, whence a year before the suave features of old Joseph Curwen had looked mildly down. After a time the shadows began to gather, and the sunset cheer gave place to a vague growing terror which flew shadow-like before the night. Mr. Ward finally arrived, and shewed much surprise and anger at his sons absence after all the pains which had been taken to guard him. He had not known of Charless appointment, and promised to notify Willett when the youth returned. In bidding the doctor goodnight he expressed his utter perplexity at his sons condition, and urged his caller to do all he could to restore the boy to normal poise. Willett was glad to escape from that library, for something frightful and unholy seemed to haunt it; as if the vanished picture had left behind a legacy of evil. He had never liked that picture; and even now, strong-nerved though he was, there lurked a quality in its vacant panel which made him feel an urgent need to get out into the pure air as soon as possible.3.      The next morning Willett received a message from the senior Ward, saying that Charles was still absent. Mr. Ward mentioned that Dr. Allen had telephoned him to say that Charles would remain at Pawtuxet for some time, and that he must not be disturbed. This was necessary because Allen himself was suddenly called away for an indefinite period, leaving the researches in need of Charless constant oversight. Charles sent his best wishes, and regretted any bother his abrupt change of plans might have caused. In listening to this message Mr. Ward heard Dr. Allens voice for the first time, and it seemed to excite some vague and elusive memory which could not be actually placed, but which was disturbing to the point of fearfulness.      Faced by these baffling and contradictory reports, Dr. Willett was frankly at a loss what to do. The frantic earnestness of Charless note was not to be denied, yet what could one think of its writers immediate violation of his own expressed policy? Young Ward had written that his delvings had become blasphemous and menacing, that they and his bearded colleague must be extirpated at any cost, and that he himself would never return to their final scene; yet according to latest advices he had forgotten all this and was back in the thick of the mystery. Common sense bade one leave the youth alone with his freakishness, yet some deeper instinct would not permit the impression of that frenzied letter to subside. Willett read it over again, and could not make its essence sound as empty and insane as both its bombastic verbiage and its lack of fulfilment would seem to imply. Its terror was too profound and real, and in conjunction with what the doctor already knew evoked too vivid hints of monstrosities from beyond time and space to permit of any cynical explanation. There were nameless horrors abroad; and no matter how little one might be able to get at them, one ought to stand prepared for any sort of action at any time.      For over a week Dr. Willett pondered on the dilemma which seemed thrust upon him, and became more and more inclined to pay Charles a call at the Pawtuxet bungalow. No friend of the youth had ever ventured to storm this forbidden retreat, and even his father knew of its interior only from such descriptions as he chose to give; but Willett felt that some direct conversation with his patient was necessary. Mr. Ward had been receiving brief and non-committal typed notes from his son, and said that Mrs. Ward in her Atlantic City retirement had had no better word. So at length the doctor resolved to act; and despite a curious sensation inspired by old legends of Joseph Curwen, and by more recent revelations and warnings from Charles Ward, set boldly out for the bungalow on the bluff above the river.      Willett had visited the spot before through sheer curiosity, though of course never entering the house or proclaiming his presence; hence knew exactly the route to take. Driving out Broad Street one early afternoon toward the end of February in his small motor, he thought oddly of the grim party which had taken that selfsame road a hundred and fifty-seven years before on a terrible errand which none might ever comprehend.      The ride through the citys decaying fringe was short, and trim Edgewood and sleepy Pawtuxet presently spread out ahead. Willett turned to the right down Lockwood Street and drove his car as far along that rural road as he could, then alighted and walked north to where the bluff towered above the lovely bends of the river and the sweep of misty downlands beyond. Houses were still few here, and there was no mistaking the isolated bungalow with its concrete garage on a high point of land at his left. Stepping briskly up the neglected gravel walk he rapped at the door with a firm hand, and spoke without a tremor to the evil Portuguese mulatto who opened it to the width of a crack.      He must, he said, see Charles Ward at once on vitally important business. No excuse would be accepted, and a repulse would mean only a full report of the matter to the elder Ward. The mulatto still hesitated, and pushed against the door when Willett attempted to open it; but the doctor merely raised his voice and renewed his demands. Then there came from the dark interior a husky whisper which somehow chilled the hearer through and through though he did not know why he feared it. \"Let him in, Tony,\" it said, \"we may as well talk now as ever.\" But disturbing as was the whisper, the greater fear was that which immediately followed. The floor creaked and the speaker hove in sight - and the owner of those strange and resonant tones was seen to be no other than Charles Dexter Ward.      The minuteness with which Dr. Willett recalled and recorded his conversation of that afternoon is due to the importance he assigns to this particular period. For at last he concedes a vital change in Charles Dexter Wards mentality, and believes that the youth now spoke from a brain hopelessly alien to the brain whose growth he had watched for six and twenty years. Controversy with Dr. Lyman has compelled him to be very specific, and he definitely dates the madness of Charles Ward from the time the typewritten notes began to reach his parents. Those notes are not in Wards normal style; not even in the style of that last frantic letter to Willett. Instead, they are strange and archaic, as if the snapping of the writers mind had released a flood of tendencies and impressions picked up unconsciously through boyhood antiquarianism. There is an obvious effort to be modern, but the spirit and occasionally the language are those of the past.      The past, too, was evident in Wards every tone and gesture as he received the doctor in that shadowy bungalow. He bowed, motioned Willett to a seat, and began to speak abruptly in that strange whisper which he sought to explain at the very outset.      \"I am grown phthisical,\" he began, \"from this cursed river air. You must excuse my speech. I suppose you are come from my father to see what ails me, and I hope you will say nothing to alarm him.\"      Willett was studying these scraping tones with extreme care, but studying even more closely the face of the speaker. Something, he felt, was wrong; and he thought of what the family had told him about the fright of that Yorkshire butler one night. He wished it were not so dark, but did not request that any blind be opened. Instead, he merely asked Ward why he had so belied the frantic note of little more than a week before.      \"I was coming to that,\" the host replied. \"You must know, I am in a very bad state of nerves, and do and say queer things I cannot account for. As I have told you often, I am on the edge of great matters; and the bigness of them has a way of making me light-headed. Any man might well be frighted of what I have found, but I am not to be put off for long. I was a dunce to have that guard and stick at home; for having gone this far, my place is here. I am not well spoke of by my prying neighbours, and perhaps I was led by weakness to believe myself what they say of me. There is no evil to any in what I do, so long as I do it rightly. Have the goodness to wait six months, and Ill shew you what will pay your patience well.      \"You may as well know I have a way of learning old matters from things surer than books, and Ill leave you to judge the importance of what I can give to history, philosophy, and the arts by reason of the doors I have access to. My ancestor had all this when those witless peeping Toms came and murdered him. I now have it again, or am coming very imperfectly to have a part of it. This time nothing must happen, and least of all through any idiot fears of my own. Pray forget all I writ you, Sir, and have no fear of this place or any in it. Dr. Allen is a man of fine parts, and I owe him an apology for anything ill I have said of him. I wish I had no need to spare him, but there were things he had to do elsewhere. His zeal is equal to mine in all those matters, and I suppose that when I feared the work I feared him too as my greatest helper in it.\"      Ward paused, and the doctor hardly knew what to say or think. He felt almost foolish in the face of this calm repudiation of the letter; and yet there clung to him the fact that while the present discourse was strange and alien and indubitably mad, the note itself had been tragic in its naturalness and likeness to the Charles Ward he knew. Willett now tried to turn the talk on early matters, and recall to the youth some past events which would restore a familiar mood; but in this process he obtained only the most grotesque results. It was the same with all the alienists later on. Important sections of Charles Wards store of mental images, mainly those touching modern times and his own personal life, had been unaccountably expunged; whilst all the massed antiquarianism of his youth had welled up from some profound subconsciousness to engulf the contemporary and the individual. The youths intimate knowledge of elder things was abnormal and unholy, and he tried his best to hide it. When Willett would mention some favourite object of his boyhood archaistic studies he often shed by pure accident such a light as no normal mortal could conceivably be expected to possess, and the doctor shuddered as the glib allusion glided by.      It was not wholesome to know so much about the way the fat sheriffs wig fell off as he leaned over at the play in Mr. Douglass Histrionick Academy in King Street on the eleventh of February, 1762, which fell on a Thursday; or about how the actors cut the text of Steeles Conscious Lovers so badly that one was almost glad the Baptist-ridden legislature closed the theatre a fortnight later. That Thomas Sabins Boston coach was \"damnd uncomfortable\" old letters may well have told; but what healthy antiquarian could recall how the creaking of Epenetus Olneys new signboard (the gaudy crown he set up after he took to calling his tavern the Crown Coffee House) was exactly like the first few notes of the new jazz piece all the radios in Pawtuxet were playing?      Ward, however, would not be quizzed long in this vein. Modern and personal topics he waved aside quite summarily, whilst regarding antique affairs he soon shewed the plainest boredom. What he wished clearly enough was only to satisfy his visitor enough to make him depart without the intention of returning. To this end he offered to shew Willett the entire house, and at once proceeded to lead the doctor through every room from cellar to attic. Willett looked sharply, but noted that the visible books were far too few and trivial ever to have filled the wide gaps on Wards shelves at home, and that the meagre so-called \"laboratory\" was the flimsiest sort of a blind. Clearly there were a library and a laboratory elsewhere; but just where, it was impossible to say. Essentially defeated in his quest for something he could not name, Willett returned to town before evening and told the senior Ward everything which had occurred. They agreed that the youth must be definitely out of his mind, but decided that nothing drastic need be done just then. Above all, Mrs. Ward must be kept in as complete an ignorance as her sons own strange typed notes would permit.      Mr. Ward now determined to call in person upon his son, making it wholly a surprise visit. Dr. Willett took him in his car one evening, guiding him to within sight of the bungalow and waiting patiently for his return. The session was a long one, and the father emerged in a very saddened and perplexed state. His reception had developed much like Willetts, save that Charles had been an excessively long time in appearing after the visitor had forced his way into the hall and sent the Portuguese away with an imperative demand; and in the bearing of the altered son there was no trace of filial affection. The lights had been dim, yet even so the youth had complained that they dazzled him outrageously. He had not spoken out loud at all, averring that his throat was in very poor condition; but in his hoarse whisper there was a quality so vaguely disturbing that Mr. Ward could not banish it from his mind.      Now definitely leagued together to do all they could toward the youths mental salvation, Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett set about collecting every scrap of data which the case might afford. Pawtuxet gossip was the first item they studied, and this was relatively easy to glean since both had friends in that region. Dr. Willett obtained the most rumours because people talked more frankly to him than to a parent of the central figure, and from all he heard he could tell that young Wards life had become indeed a strange one. Common tongues would not dissociate his household from the vampirism of the previous summer, while the nocturnal comings and goings of the motor trucks provided their share of dark speculation. Local tradesmen spoke of the queerness of the orders brought them by the evil-looking mulatto, and in particular of the inordinate amounts of meat and fresh blood secured from the two butcher shops in the immediate neighbourhood. For a household of only three, these quantities were quite absurd.      Then there was the matter of the sounds beneath the earth. Reports of these things were harder to pin down, but all the vague hints tallied in certain basic essentials. Noises of a ritual nature positively existed, and at times when the bungalow was dark. They might, of course, have come from the known cellar; but rumour insisted that there were deeper and more spreading crypts. Recalling the ancient tales of Joseph Curwens catacombs, and assuming for granted that the present bungalow had been selected because of its situation on the old Curwen site as revealed in one or another of the documents found behind the picture, Willett and Mr. Ward gave this phase of the gossip much attention; and searched many times without success for the door in the river-bank which old manuscripts mentioned. As to popular opinions of the bungalows various inhabitants, it was soon plain that the Brava Portuguese was loathed, the bearded and spectacled Dr. Allen feared, and the pallid young scholar disliked to a profound extent. During the last week or two Ward had obviously changed much, abandoning his attempts at affability and speaking only in hoarse but oddly repellent whispers on the few occasions that he ventured forth.      Such were the shreds and fragments gathered here and there; and over these Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett held many long and serious conferences. They strove to exercise deduction, induction, and constructive imagination to their utmost extent; and to correlate every known fact of Charless later life, including the frantic letter which the doctor now shewed the father, with the meagre documentary evidence available concerning old Joseph Curwen. They would have given much for a glimpse of the papers Charles had found, for very clearly the key to the youths madness lay in what he had learned of the ancient wizard and his doings.4.      And yet, after all, it was from no step of Mr. Wards or Dr. Willetts that the next move in this singular case proceeded. The father and the physician, rebuffed and confused by a shadow too shapeless and intangible to combat, had rested uneasily on their oars while the typed notes of young Ward to his parents grew fewer and fewer. Then came the first of the month with its customary financial adjustments, and the clerks at certain banks began a peculiar shaking of heads and telephoning from one to the other. Officials who knew Charles Ward by sight went down to the bungalow to ask why every cheque of his appearing at this juncture was a clumsy forgery, and were reassurred less than they ought to have been when the youth hoarsely explained that his hand had lately been so much affected by a nervous shock as to make normal writing impossible. He could, he said, form no written characters at all except with great difficulty; and could prove it by the fact that he had been forced to type all his recent letters, even those to his father and mother, who would bear out the assertion.      What made the investigators pause in confusion was not this circumstance alone, for that was nothing unprecedented or fundamentally suspicious; nor even the Pawtuxet gossip, of which one or two of them had caught echoes. It was the muddled discourse of the young man which nonplussed them, implying as it did a virtually total loss of memory concerning important monetary matters which he had had at his fingertips only a month or two before. Something was wrong; for despite the apparent coherence and rationality of his speech, there could be no normal reason for this ill-concealed blankness on vital points. Moreover, although none of these men knew Ward well, they could not help observing the change in his language and manner. They had heard he was an antiquarian, but even the most hopeless antiquarians do not make daily use of obsolete phraseology and gestures. Altogether, this combination of hoarseness, palsied hands, bad memory, and altered speech and bearing must represent some disturbance or malady of genuine gravity, which no doubt formed the basis of the prevailing odd rumours; and after their departure the party of officials decided that a talk with the senior Ward was imperative.      So on the sixth of March, 1928, there was a long and serious conference in Mr. Wards office, after which the utterly bewildered father summoned Dr. Willett in a kind of helpless resignation. Willett looked over the strained and awkward signatures of the cheques, and compared them in his mind with the penmanship of that last frantic note. Certainly, the change was radical and profound, and yet there was something damnably familiar about the new writing. It had crabbed and archaic tendencies of a very curious sort, and seemed to result from a type of stroke utterly different from that which the youth had always used. It was strange - but where had he seen it before? On the whole, it was obvious that Charles was insane. Of that there could be no doubt. And since it appeared unlikely that he could handle his property or continue to deal with the outside world much longer, something must quickly be done toward his oversight and possible cure. It was then that the alienists were called in, Drs. Peck and Waite of Providence and Dr. Lyman of Boston, to whom Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett gave the most exhaustive possible history of the case, and who conferred at length in the now unused library of their young patient, examining what books and papers of his were left in order to gain some further notion of his habitual mental cast. After scanning this material and examining the ominous note to Willett they all agreed that Charles Wards studies had been enough to unseat or at least to warp any ordinary intellect, and wished most heartily that they could see his more intimate volumes and documents; but this latter they knew they could do, if at all, only after a scene at the bungalow itself. Willett now reviewed the whole case with febrile energy; it being at this time that he obtained the statements of the workmen who had seen Charles find the Curwen documents, and that he collated the incidents of the destroyed newspaper items, looking up the latter at the Journal office.      On Thursday, the eighth of March, Drs. Willett, Peck, Lyman, and Waite, accompanied by Mr. Ward, paid the youth their momentous call; making no concealment of their object and questioning the now acknowledged patient with extreme minuteness. Charles, though he was inordinately long in answering the summons and was still redolent of strange and noxious laboratory odours when he did finally make his agitated appearance, proved a far from recalcitrant subject; and admitted freely that his memory and balance had suffered somewhat from close application to abstruse studies. He offered no resistance when his removal to other quarters was insisted upon; and seemed, indeed, to display a high degree of intelligence as apart from mere memory. His conduct would have sent his interviewers away in bafflement had not the persistently archaic trend of his speech and unmistakable replacement of modern by ancient ideas in his consciousness marked him out as one definitely removed from the normal. Of his work he would say no more to the group of doctors than he had formerly said to his family and to Dr. Willett, and his frantic note of the previous month he dismissed as mere nerves and hysteria. He insisted that this shadowy bungalow possessed no library or laboratory beyond the visible ones, and waxed abstruse in explaining the absence from the house of such odours as now saturated all his clothing. Neighbourhood gossip he attributed to nothing more than the cheap inventiveness of baffled curiosity. Of the whereabouts of Dr. Allen he said he did not feel at liberty to speak definitely, but assured his inquisitors that the bearded and spectacled man would return when needed. In paying off the stolid Brava who resisted all questioning by the visitors, and in closing the bungalow which still seemed to hold such nighted secrets, Ward shewed no sign of nervousness save a barely noticed tendency to pause as though listening for something very faint. He was apparently animated by a calmly philosophic resignation, as if his removal were the merest transient incident which would cause the least trouble if facilitated and disposed of once and for all. It was clear that he trusted to his obviously unimpaired keenness of absolute mentality to overcome all the embarrassments into which his twisted memory, his lost voice and handwriting, and his secretive and eccentric behaviour had led him. His mother, it was agreed, was not to be told of the change; his father supplying typed notes in his name. Ward was taken to the restfully and picturesquely situated private hospital maintained by Dr. Waite on Conanicut Island in the bay, and subjected to the closest scrutiny and questioning by all the physicians connected with the case. It was then that the physical oddities were noticed; the slackened metabolism, the altered skin, and the disproportionate neural reactions. Dr. Willett was the most perturbed of the various examiners, for he had attended Ward all his life and could appreciate with terrible keenness the extent of his physical disorganisation. Even the familiar olive mark on his hip was gone, while on his chest was a great black mole or cicatrice which had never been there before, and which made Willett wonder whether the youth had ever submitted to any of the \"witch markings\" reputed to be inflicted at certain unwholesome nocturnal meetings in wild and lonely places. The doctor could not keep his mind off a certain transcribed witch-trial record from Salem which Charles had shewn him in the old non-secretive days, and which read: \"Mr. G. B. on that Nighte putt ye Divell his Marke upon Bridget S., Jonathan A., Simon O., Deliverance W., Joseph C., Susan P., Mehitable C., and Deborah B.\" Wards face, too, troubled him horribly, till at length he suddenly discovered why he was horrified. For above the young mans right eye was something which he had never previously noticed - a small scar or pit precisely like that in the crumbled painting of old Joseph Curwen, and perhaps attesting some hideous ritualistic inoculation to which both had submitted at a certain stage of their occult careers.      While Ward himself was puzzling all the doctors at the hospital a very strict watch was kept on all mail addressed either to him or to Dr. Allen, which Mr. Ward had ordered delivered at the family home. Willett had predicted that very little would be found, since any communications of a vital nature would probably have been exchanged by messenger; but in the latter part of March there did come a letter from Prague for Dr. Allen which gave both the doctor and the father deep thought. It was in a very crabbed and archaic hand; and though clearly not the effort of a foreigner, shewed almost as singular a departure from modern English as the speech of young Ward himself. It read:Kleinstrasse 11,            Altstadt, Prague,      11th Feby. 1928.Brother in Almousin-Metraton: -       I this day receivd yr mention of what came up from the Salts I sent you. It was wrong, and meanes clearly that ye Headstones had been changd when Barnabas gott me the Specimen.

C. inProvidence.      Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett paused in utter chaos before this apparent bit of unrelieved insanity. Only by degrees did they absorb what it seemed to imply. So the absent Dr. Allen, and not Charles Ward, had come to be the leading spirit at Pawtuxet? That must explain the wild reference and denunciation in the youths last frantic letter. And what of this addressing of the bearded and spectacled stranger as \"Mr. J. C.\"? There was no escaping the inference, but there are limits to possible monstrosity. Who was \"Simon O.\"; the old man Ward had visited in Prague four years previously? Perhaps, but in the centuries behind there had been another Simon O. - Simon Orne, alias Jedediah, of Salem, who vanished in 1771, and whose peculiar handwriting Dr. Willett now unmistakably recognised from the photostatic copies of the Orne formulae which Charles had once shewn him. What horrors and mysteries, what contradictions and contraventions of Nature, had come back after a century and a half to harass Old Providence with her clustered spires and domes?      The father and the old physician, virtually at a loss what to do or think, went to see Charles at the hospital and questioned him as delicately as they could about Dr. Allen, about the Prague visit, and about what he had learned of Simon or Jedediah Orne of Salem. To all these inquiries the youth was politely non-committal, merely barking in his hoarse whisper that he had found Dr. Allen to have a remarkable spiritual rapport with certain souls from the past, and that any correspondent the bearded man might have in Prague would probably be similarly gifted. When they left, Mr. Ward and Dr. Willett realised to their chagrin that they had really been the ones under catechism; and that without imparting anything vital himself, the confined youth had adroitly pumped them of everything the Prague letter had contained.      Drs. Peck, Waite, and Lyman were not inclined to attach much importance to the strange correspondence of young Wards companion; for they knew the tendency of kindred eccentrics and monomaniacs to band together, and believed that Charles or Allen had merely unearthed an expatriated counterpart - perhaps one who had seen Ornes handwriting and copied it in an attempt to pose as the bygone characters reincarnation. Allen himself was perhaps a similar case, and may have persuaded the youth into accepting him as an avatar of the long-dead Curwen. Such things had been known before, and on the same basis the hard-headed doctors disposed of Willetts growing disquiet about Charles Wards present handwriting, as studied from unpremeditated specimens obtained by various ruses. Willett thought he had placed its odd familiarity at last, and that what it vaguely resembled was the bygone penmanship of old Joseph Curwen himself; but this the other physicians regarded as a phase of imitativeness only to be expected in a mania of this sort, and refused to grant it any importance either favourable or unfavourable. Recognising this prosaic attitude in his colleagues, Willett advised Mr. Ward to keep to himself the letter which arrived for Dr. Allen on the second of April from Rakus, Transylvania, in a handwriting so intensely and fundamentally like that of the Hutchinson cipher that both father and physician paused in awe before breaking the seal. This read as follows:Castle Ferenczy      7 March 1928.Dear C.: - Hadd a Squad of 20 Militia up to talk about what the Country Folk say. Must digg deeper and have less Hearde.

But if Willett and Mr. Ward refrained from shewing this letter to the alienists, they did not refrain from acting upon it themselves. No amount of learned sophistry could controvert the fact that the strangely bearded and spectacled Dr. Allen, of whom Charless frantic letter had spoken as such a monstrous menace, was in close and sinister correspondence with two inexplicable creatures whom Ward had visited in his travels and who plainly claimed to be survivals or avatars of Curwens old Salem colleagues; that he was regarding himself as the reincarnation of Joseph Curwen, and that he entertained - or was at least advised to entertain - murderous designs against a \"boy\" who could scarcely be other than Charles Ward. There was organised horror afoot; and no matter who had started it, the missing Allen was by this time at the bottom of it. Therefore, thanking heaven that Charles was now safe in the hospital, Mr. Ward lost no time in engaging detectives to learn all they could of the cryptic bearded doctor; finding whence he had come and what Pawtuxet knew of him, and if possible discovering his current whereabouts. Supplying the men with one of the bungalow keys which Charles yielded up, he urged them to explore Allens vacant room which had been identified when the patients belongings had been packed; obtaining what clues they could from any effects he might have left about. Mr. Ward talked with the detectives in his sons old library, and they felt a marked relief when they left it at last; for there seemed to hover about the place a vague aura of evil. Perhaps it was what they had heard of the infamous old wizard whose picture had once stared from the panelled overmantel, and perhaps it was something different and irrelevant; but in any case they all half sensed an intangible miasma which centred in that carven vestige of an older dwelling and which at times almost rose to the intensity of a material emanation.", "III.Meanwhile Old Whateley continued to buy cattle without measurably increasing the size of his herd. He also cut timber and began to repair the unused parts of his house—a spacious, peaked-roofed affair whose rear end was buried entirely in the rocky hillside, and whose three least-ruined ground-floor rooms had always been sufficient for himself and his daughter. There must have been prodigious reserves of strength in the old man to enable him to accomplish so much hard labour; and though he still babbled dementedly at times, his carpentry seemed to shew the effects of sound calculation. It had already begun as soon as Wilbur was born, when one of the many tool-sheds had been put suddenly in order, clapboarded, and fitted with a stout fresh lock. Now, in restoring the abandoned upper story of the house, he was a no less thorough craftsman. His mania shewed itself only in his tight boarding-up of all the windows in the reclaimed section—though many declared that it was a crazy thing to bother with the reclamation at all. Less inexplicable was his fitting up of another downstairs room for his new grandson—a room which several callers saw, though no one was ever admitted to the closely boarded upper story. This chamber he lined with tall, firm shelving; along which he began gradually to arrange, in apparently careful order, all the rotting ancient books and parts of books which during his own day had been heaped promiscuously in odd corners of the various rooms.      “I made some use of ’em,” he would say as he tried to mend a torn black-letter page with paste prepared on the rusty kitchen stove, “but the boy’s fitten to make better use of ’em. He’d orter hev ’em as well sot as he kin, for they’re goin’ to be all of his larnin’.”      When Wilbur was a year and seven months old—in September of 1914—his size and accomplishments were almost alarming. He had grown as large as a child of four, and was a fluent and incredibly intelligent talker. He ran freely about the fields and hills, and accompanied his mother on all her wanderings. At home he would pore diligently over the queer pictures and charts in his grandfather’s books, while Old Whateley would instruct and catechise him through long, hushed afternoons. By this time the restoration of the house was finished, and those who watched it wondered why one of the upper windows had been made into a solid plank door. It was a window in the rear of the east gable end, close against the hill; and no one could imagine why a cleated wooden runway was built up to it from the ground. About the period of this work’s completion people noticed that the old tool-house, tightly locked and windowlessly clapboarded since Wilbur’s birth, had been abandoned again. The door swung listlessly open, and when Earl Sawyer once stepped within after a cattle-selling call on Old Whateley he was quite discomposed by the singular odour he encountered—such a stench, he averred, as he had never before smelt in all his life except near the Indian circles on the hills, and which could not come from anything sane or of this earth. But then, the homes and sheds of Dunwich folk have never been remarkable for olfactory immaculateness.      The following months were void of visible events, save that everyone swore to a slow but steady increase in the mysterious hill noises. On May-Eve of 1915 there were tremors which even the Aylesbury people felt, whilst the following Hallowe’en produced an underground rumbling queerly synchronised with bursts of flame—“them witch Whateleys’ doin’s”—from the summit of Sentinel Hill. Wilbur was growing up uncannily, so that he looked like a boy of ten as he entered his fourth year. He read avidly by himself now; but talked much less than formerly. A settled taciturnity was absorbing him, and for the first time people began to speak specifically of the dawning look of evil in his goatish face. He would sometimes mutter an unfamiliar jargon, and chant in bizarre rhythms which chilled the listener with a sense of unexplainable terror. The aversion displayed toward him by dogs had now become a matter of wide remark, and he was obliged to carry a pistol in order to traverse the countryside in safety. His occasional use of the weapon did not enhance his popularity amongst the owners of canine guardians.      The few callers at the house would often find Lavinia alone on the ground floor, while odd cries and footsteps resounded in the boarded-up second story. She would never tell what her father and the boy were doing up there, though once she turned pale and displayed an abnormal degree of fear when a jocose fish-peddler tried the locked door leading to the stairway. That peddler told the store loungers at Dunwich Village that he thought he heard a horse stamping on that floor above. The loungers reflected, thinking of the door and runway, and of the cattle that so swiftly disappeared. Then they shuddered as they recalled tales of Old Whateley’s youth, and of the strange things that are called out of the earth when a bullock is sacrificed at the proper time to certain heathen gods. It had for some time been noticed that dogs had begun to hate and fear the whole Whateley place as violently as they hated and feared young Wilbur personally.      In 1917 the war came, and Squire Sawyer Whateley, as chairman of the local draft board, had hard work finding a quota of young Dunwich men fit even to be sent to a development camp. The government, alarmed at such signs of wholesale regional decadence, sent several officers and medical experts to investigate; conducting a survey which New England newspaper readers may still recall. It was the publicity attending this investigation which set reporters on the track of the Whateleys, and caused the Boston Globe and Arkham Advertiser to print flamboyant Sunday stories of young Wilbur’s precociousness, Old Whateley’s black magic, the shelves of strange books, the sealed second story of the ancient farmhouse, and the weirdness of the whole region and its hill noises. Wilbur was four and a half then, and looked like a lad of fifteen. His lips and cheeks were fuzzy with a coarse dark down, and his voice had begun to break.      Earl Sawyer went out to the Whateley place with both sets of reporters and camera men, and called their attention to the queer stench which now seemed to trickle down from the sealed upper spaces. It was, he said, exactly like a smell he had found in the tool-shed abandoned when the house was finally repaired; and like the faint odours which he sometimes thought he caught near the stone circles on the mountains. Dunwich folk read the stories when they appeared, and grinned over the obvious mistakes. They wondered, too, why the writers made so much of the fact that Old Whateley always paid for his cattle in gold pieces of extremely ancient date. The Whateleys had received their visitors with ill-concealed distaste, though they did not dare court further publicity by a violent resistance or refusal to talk."]}

A Result and a Prologue1.From a private hospital for the insane near Providence, Rhode Island, there recently disappeared an exceedingly singular person. He bore the name of Charles Dexter Ward, and was placed under restraint most reluctantly by the grieving father who had watched his aberration grow from a mere eccentricity to a dark mania involving both a possibility of murderous tendencies and a profound and peculiar change in the apparent contents of his mind. Doctors confess themselves quite baffled by his case, since it presented oddities of a general physiological as well as psychological character.      In the first place, the patient seemed oddly older than his twenty-six years would warrant. Mental disturbance, it is true, will age one rapidly; but the face of this young man had taken on a subtle cast which only the very aged normally acquire. In the second place, his organic processes shewed a certain queerness of proportion which nothing in medical experience can parallel. Respiration and heart action had a baffling lack of symmetry; the voice was lost, so that no sounds above a whisper were possible; digestion was incredibly prolonged and minimised, and neural reactions to standard stimuli bore no relation at all to anything heretofore recorded, either normal or pathological. The skin had a morbid chill and dryness, and the cellular structure of the tissue seemed exaggeratedly coarse and loosely knit. Even a large olive birthmark on the right hip had disappeared, whilst there had formed on the chest a very peculiar mole or blackish spot of which no trace existed before. In general, all physicians agree that in Ward the processes of metabolism had become retarded to a degree beyond precedent.      Psychologically, too, Charles Ward was unique. His madness held no affinity to any sort recorded in even the latest and most exhaustive of treatises, and was conjoined to a mental force which would have made him a genius or a leader had it not been twisted into strange and grotesque forms. Dr. Willett, who was Wards family physician, affirms that the patients gross mental capacity, as gauged by his response to matters outside the sphere of his insanity, had actually increased since the seizure. Ward, it is true, was always a scholar and an antiquarian; but even his most brilliant early work did not shew the prodigious grasp and insight displayed during his last examinations by the alienists. It was, indeed, a difficult matter to obtain a legal commitment to the hospital, so powerful and lucid did the youths mind seem; and only on the evidence of others, and on the strength of many abnormal gaps in his stock of information as distinguished from his intelligence, was he finally placed in confinement. To the very moment of his vanishment he was an omnivorous reader and as great a conversationalist as his poor voice permitted; and shrewd observers, failing to foresee his escape, freely predicted that he would not be long in gaining his discharge from custody.      Only Dr. Willett, who brought Charles Ward into the world and had watched his growth of body and mind ever since, seemed frightened at the thought of his future freedom. He had had a terrible experience and had made a terrible discovery which he dared not reveal to his sceptical colleagues. Willett, indeed, presents a minor mystery all his own in his connexion with the case. He was the last to see the patient before his flight, and emerged from that final conversation in a state of mixed horror and relief which several recalled when Wards escape became known three hours later. That escape itself is one of the unsolved wonders of Dr. Waites hospital. A window open above a sheer drop of sixty feet could hardly explain it, yet after that talk with Willett the youth was undeniably gone. Willett himself has no public explanations to offer, though he seems strangely easier in mind than before the escape. Many, indeed, feel that he would like to say more if he thought any considerable number would believe him. He had found Ward in his room, but shortly after his departure the attendants knocked in vain. When they opened the door the patient was not there, and all they found was the open window with a chill April breeze blowing in a cloud of fine bluish-grey dust that almost choked them. True, the dogs howled some time before; but that was while Willett was still present, and they had caught nothing and shewn no disturbance later on. Wards father was told at once over the telephone, but he seemed more saddened than surprised. By the time Dr. Waite called in person, Dr. Willett had been talking with him, and both disavowed any knowledge or complicity in the escape. Only from certain closely confidential friends of Willett and the senior Ward have any clues been gained, and even these are too wildly fantastic for general credence. The one fact which remains is that up to the present time no trace of the missing madman has been unearthed.      Charles Ward was an antiquarian from infancy, no doubt gaining his taste from the venerable town around him, and from the relics of the past which filled every corner of his parents old mansion in Prospect Street on the crest of the hill. With the years his devotion to ancient things increased; so that history, genealogy, and the study of colonial architecture, furniture, and craftsmanship at length crowded everything else from his sphere of interests. These tastes are important to remember in considering his madness; for although they do not form its absolute nucleus, they play a prominent part in its superficial form. The gaps of information which the alienists noticed were all related to modern matters, and were invariably offset by a correspondingly excessive though outwardly concealed knowledge of bygone matters as brought out by adroit questioning; so that one would have fancied the patient literally transferred to a former age through some obscure sort of auto-hypnosis. The odd thing was that Ward seemed no longer interested in the antiquities he knew so well. He had, it appears, lost his regard for them through sheer familiarity; and all his final efforts were obviously bent toward mastering those common facts of the modern world which had been so totally and unmistakably expunged from his brain. That this wholesale deletion had occurred, he did his best to hide; but it was clear to all who watched him that his whole programme of reading and conversation was determined by a frantic wish to imbibe such knowledge of his own life and of the ordinary practical and cultural background of the twentieth century as ought to have been his by virtue of his birth in 1902 and his education in the schools of our own time. Alienists are now wondering how, in view of his vitally impaired range of data, the escaped patient manages to cope with the complicated world of today; the dominant opinion being that he is lying low in some humble and unexacting position till his stock of modern information can be brought up to the normal.      The beginning of Wards madness is a matter of dispute among alienists. Dr. Lyman, the eminent Boston authority, places it in 1919 or 1920, during the boys last year at the Moses Brown School, when he suddenly turned from the study of the past to the study of the occult, and refused to qualify for college on the ground that he had individual researches of much greater importance to make. This is certainly borne out by Wards altered habits at the time, especially by his continual search through town records and among old burying-grounds for a certain grave dug in 1771; the grave of an ancestor named Joseph Curwen, some of whose papers he professed to have found behind the panelling of a very old house in Olney Court, on Stampers Hill, which Curwen was known to have built and occupied. It is, broadly speaking, undeniable that the winter of 1919-20 saw a great change in Ward; whereby he abruptly stopped his general antiquarian pursuits and embarked on a desperate delving into occult subjects both at home and abroad, varied only by this strangely persistent search for his forefathers grave.      From this opinion, however, Dr. Willett substantially dissents; basing his verdict on his close and continuous knowledge of the patient, and on certain frightful investigations and discoveries which he made toward the last. Those investigations and discoveries have left their mark upon him; so that his voice trembles when he tells them, and his hand trembles when he tries to write of them. Willett admits that the change of 1919-20 would ordinarily appear to mark the beginning of a progressive decadence which culminated in the horrible and uncanny alienation of 1928; but believes from personal observation that a finer distinction must be made. Granting freely that the boy was always ill-balanced temperamentally, and prone to be unduly susceptible and enthusiastic in his responses to phenomena around him, he refuses to concede that the early alteration marked the actual passage from sanity to madness; crediting instead Wards own statement that he had discovered or rediscovered something whose effect on human thought was likely to be marvellous and profound. The true madness, he is certain, came with a later change; after the Curwen portrait and the ancient papers had been unearthed; after a trip to strange foreign places had been made, and some terrible invocations chanted under strange and secret circumstances; after certain answers to these invocations had been plainly indicated, and a frantic letter penned under agonising and inexplicable conditions; after the wave of vampirism and the ominous Pawtuxet gossip; and after the patients memory commenced to exclude contemporary images whilst his voice failed and his physical aspect underwent the subtle modification so many subsequently noticed.      It was only about this time, Willett points out with much acuteness, that the nightmare qualities became indubitably linked with Ward; and the doctor feels shudderingly sure that enough solid evidence exists to sustain the youths claim regarding his crucial discovery. In the first place, two workmen of high intelligence saw Joseph Curwens ancient papers found. Secondly, the boy once shewed Dr. Willett those papers and a page of the Curwen diary, and each of the documents had every appearance of genuineness. The hole where Ward claimed to have found them was long a visible reality, and Willett had a very convincing final glimpse of them in surroundings which can scarcely be believed and can never perhaps be proved. Then there were the mysteries and coincidences of the Orne and Hutchinson letters, and the problem of the Curwen penmanship and of what the detectives brought to light about Dr. Allen; these things, and the terrible message in mediaeval minuscules found in Willetts pocket when he gained consciousness after his shocking experience.      And most conclusive of all, there are the two hideous results which the doctor obtained from a certain pair of formulae during his final investigations; results which virtually proved the authenticity of the papers and of their monstrous implications at the same time that those papers were borne forever from human knowledge.2.      One must look back at Charles Wards earlier life as at something belonging as much to the past as the antiquities he loved so keenly. In the autumn of 1918, and with a considerable show of zest in the military training of the period, he had begun his junior year at the Moses Brown School, which lies very near his home. The old main building, erected in 1819, had always charmed his youthful antiquarian sense; and the spacious park in which the academy is set appealed to his sharp eye for landscape. His social activities were few; and his hours were spent mainly at home, in rambling walks, in his classes and drills, and in pursuit of antiquarian and genealogical data at the City Hall, the State House, the Public Library, the Athenaeum, the Historical Society, the John Carter Brown and John Hay Libraries of Brown University, and the newly opened Shepley Library in Benefit Street. One may picture him yet as he was in those days; tall, slim, and blond, with studious eyes and a slight stoop, dressed somewhat carelessly, and giving a dominant impression of harmless awkwardness rather than attractiveness.      His walks were always adventures in antiquity, during which he managed to recapture from the myriad relics of a glamorous old city a vivid and connected picture of the centuries before. His home was a great Georgian mansion atop the well-nigh precipitous hill that rises just east of the river; and from the rear windows of its rambling wings he could look dizzily out over all the clustered spires, domes, roofs, and skyscraper summits of the lower town to the purple hills of the countryside beyond. Here he was born, and from the lovely classic porch of the double-bayed brick facade his nurse had first wheeled him in his carriage; past the little white farmhouse of two hundred years before that the town had long ago overtaken, and on toward the stately colleges along the shady, sumptuous street, whose old square brick mansions and smaller wooden houses with narrow, heavy-columned Doric porches dreamed solid and exclusive amidst their generous yards and gardens.      He had been wheeled, too, along sleepy Congdon Street, one tier lower down on the steep hill, and with all its eastern homes on high terraces. The small wooden houses averaged a greater age here, for it was up this hill that the growing town had climbed; and in these rides he had imbibed something of the colour of a quaint colonial village. The nurse used to stop and sit on the benches of Prospect Terrace to chat with policemen; and one of the childs first memories was of the great westward sea of hazy roofs and domes and steeples and far hills which he saw one winter afternoon from that great railed embankment, all violet and mystic against a fevered, apocalyptic sunset of reds and golds and purples and curious greens. The vast marble dome of the State House stood out in massive silhouette, its crowning statue haloed fantastically by a break in one of the tinted stratus clouds that barred the flaming sky.      When he was larger his famous walks began; first with his impatiently dragged nurse, and then alone in dreamy meditation. Farther and farther down that almost perpendicular hill he would venture, each time reaching older and quainter levels of the ancient city. He would hesitate gingerly down vertical Jenckes Street with its bank walls and colonial gables to the shady Benefit Street corner, where before him was a wooden antique with an Ionic-pilastered pair of doorways, and beside him a prehistoric gambrel-roofer with a bit of primal farmyard remaining, and the great Judge Durfee house with its fallen vestiges of Georgian grandeur. It was getting to be a slum here; but the titan elms cast a restoring shadow over the place, and the boy used to stroll south past the long lines of the pre-Revolutionary homes with their great central chimneys and classic portals. On the eastern side they were set high over basements with railed double flights of stone steps, and the young Charles could picture them as they were when the street was new, and red heels and periwigs set off the painted pediments whose signs of wear were now becoming so visible.      Westward the hill dropped almost as steeply as above, down to the old \"Town Street\" that the founders had laid out at the rivers edge in 1636. Here ran innumerable little lanes with leaning, huddled houses of immense antiquity; and fascinated though he was, it was long before he dared to thread their archaic verticality for fear they would turn out a dream or a gateway to unknown terrors. He found it much less formidable to continue along Benefit Street past the iron fence of St. Johns hidden churchyard and the rear of the 1761 Colony House and the mouldering bulk of the Golden Ball Inn where Washington stopped. At Meeting Street - the successive Gaol Lane and King Street of other periods - he would look upward to the east and see the arched flight of steps to which the highway had to resort in climbing the slope, and downward to the west, glimpsing the old brick colonial schoolhouse that smiles across the road at the ancient Sign of Shakespears Head where the Providence Gazette and Country-Journal was printed before the Revolution. Then came the exquisite First Baptist Church of 1775, luxurious with its matchless Gibbs steeple, and the Georgian roofs and cupolas hovering by. Here and to the southward the neighbourhood became better, flowering at last into a marvellous group of early mansions; but still the little ancient lanes led off down the precipice to the west, spectral in their many-gabled archaism and dipping to a riot of iridescent decay where the wicked old waterfront recalls its proud East India days amidst polyglot vice and squalor, rotting wharves, and blear-eyed ship-chandleries, with such surviving alley names as Packet, Bullion, Gold, Silver, Coin, Doubloon, Sovereign, Guilder, Dollar, Dime, and Cent.      Sometimes, as he grew taller and more adventurous, young Ward would venture down into this maelstrom of tottering houses, broken transoms, tumbling steps, twisted balustrades, swarthy faces, and nameless odours; winding from South Main to South Water, searching out the docks where the bay and sound steamers still touched, and returning northward at this lower level past the steep-roofed 1816 warehouses and the broad square at the Great Bridge, where the 1773 Market House still stands firm on its ancient arches. In that square he would pause to drink in the bewildering beauty of the old town as it rises on its eastward bluff, decked with its two Georgian spires and crowned by the vast new Christian Science dome as London is crowned by St. Pauls. He liked mostly to reach this point in the late afternoon, when the slanting sunlight touches the Market House and the ancient hill roofs and belfries with gold, and throws magic around the dreaming wharves where Providence Indiamen used to ride at anchor. After a long look he would grow almost dizzy with a poets love for the sight, and then he would scale the slope homeward in the dusk past the old white church and up the narrow precipitous ways where yellow gleams would begin to peep out in small-paned windows and through fanlights set high over double flights of steps with curious wrought-iron railings.      At other times, and in later years, he would seek for vivid contrasts; spending half a walk in the crumbling colonial regions northwest of his home, where the hill drops to the lower eminence of Stampers Hill with its ghetto and negro quarter clustering round the place where the Boston stage coach used to start before the Revolution, and the other half in the gracious southerly realm about George, Benevolent, Power, and Williams Streets, where the old slope holds unchanged the fine estates and bits of walled garden and steep green lane in which so many fragrant memories linger. These rambles, together with the diligent studies which accompanied them, certainly account for a large amount of the antiquarian lore which at last crowded the modern world from Charles Wards mind; and illustrate the mental soil upon which fell, in that fateful winter of 1919-20, the seeds that came to such strange and terrible fruition.      Dr. Willett is certain that, up to this ill-omened winter of first change, Charles Wards antiquarianism was free from every trace of the morbid. Graveyards held for him no particular attraction beyond their quaintness and historic value, and of anything like violence or savage instinct he was utterly devoid. Then, by insidious degrees, there appeared to develop a curious sequel to one of his genealogical triumphs of the year before; when he had discovered among his maternal ancestors a certain very long-lived man named Joseph Curwen, who had come from Salem in March of 1692, and about whom a whispered series of highly peculiar and disquieting stories clustered.      Wards great-great-grandfather Welcome Potter had in 1785 married a certain \"Ann Tillinghast, daughter of Mrs. Eliza, daughter to Capt. James Tillinghast\", of whose paternity the family had preserved no trace. Late in 1918, whilst examining a volume of original town records in manuscript, the young genealogist encountered an entry describing a legal change of name, by which in 1772 a Mrs. Eliza Curwen, widow of Joseph Curwen, resumed, along with her seven-year-old daughter Ann, her maiden name of Tillinghast; on the ground that her Husbands name was become a publick Reproach by Reason of what was knowne after his Decease; the which confirming an antient common Rumour, tho not to be credited by a loyall Wife till so proven as to be wholely past Doubting. This entry came to light upon the accidental separation of two leaves which had been carefully pasted together and treated as one by a laboured revision of the page numbers.      It was at once clear to Charles Ward that he had indeed discovered a hitherto unknown great-great-great-grandfather. The discovery doubly excited him because he had already heard vague reports and seen scattered allusions relating to this person; about whom there remained so few publicly available records, aside from those becoming public only in modern times, that it almost seemed as if a conspiracy had existed to blot him from memory. What did appear, moreover, was of such a singular and provocative nature that one could not fail to imagine curiously what it was that the colonial recorders were so anxious to conceal and forget; or to suspect that the deletion had reasons all too valid.      Before this, Ward had been content to let his romancing about old Joseph Curwen remain in the idle stage; but having discovered his own relationship to this apparently \"hushed-up\" character, he proceeded to hunt out as systematically as possible whatever he might find concerning him. In this excited quest he eventually succeeded beyond his highest expectations; for old letters, diaries, and sheaves of unpublished memoirs in cobwebbed Providence garrets and elsewhere yielded many illuminating passages which their writers had not thought it worth their while to destroy. One important sidelight came from a point as remote as New York, where some Rhode Island colonial correspondence was stored in the Museum at Fraunces Tavern. The really crucial thing, though, and what in Dr. Willetts opinion formed the definite source of Wards undoing, was the matter found in August 1919 behind the panelling of the crumbling house in Olney Court. It was that, beyond a doubt, which opened up those black vistas whose end was deeper than the pit.", "Some people who sleep at the Dreamers Inn, in my hometown of Leight, Massachusetts, never wake up.So it is said. Tis a wonder that our only boarding place for travelers manages to stay open at all, with the ceaseless grinding of the rumor mill reaching wayfarers ears before they reach here. Our villages moniker is pronounced as if the \"e\" were not there, nor any source of illumination. Despite our best efforts to redeem the name of Leight, it is still spoken like a curse. We are God-fearing folk now, in anno Domini 1893, but some of us werent two hundred years ago. The witchcraft panic that had hit Salem in 1692 infected us like a fever one year later. Fifty people were sickened, and cured by a visit to Gallows Hill.My great-great-grandfather and original proprietor of the Inn, Goodman Abner Dawes, was one of them.My name is Millicent Dawson. Even though Im four generations descended from him, respectable people in Leight cross to the other side of the street when they see me. If it werent for my late fathers pension, Id be searching these same streets for men too drunk to care about my ancestry. Im a spinster at thirty-four, but still pretty according to the Inns current owner. Not that Id have Monsieur Thènard! He is no drunkard, but sometimes I wish he were. His eyes, never bloodshot and always keen, are those of a wolf.Is it he that continues to lend the rumors such credence? Has he dared to murder his own customers?Pah! Its far more likely that the villagers, many of whom are superstitious illiterates, want to keep anyone from having anything to do with the Dreamers Inn because theyre terrified. I, for one, am not. I know my great-great-grandfathers establishment for what it is: a broken-down lodging house, greatly refurbished, with three floors and servants quarters at the top. Its the closest thing that Leight has to a castle, because the guest rooms and garret are contained within a tall turret. The Inn is the very sort that inspires ghosts and unspeakable phantoms to possess ones imagination - even mine. I suppose I cannot blame my naïve neighbors too much. If Im out in the evening, having a bite of dinner at our only restaurant, I try not to gaze up at that tower. As it darkens in the fading twilight, it slowly turns blacker than any sort of pitch.What is it about the place that makes me shudder, even though Im not so silly as to believe its haunted?How has it remained a dreamers refuge for more than two centuries, my ancestors toil notwithstanding?Why do I always see it in my own dreams, as it draws me like iron toward a magnet?Such mysteries are better left unsolved. What I must do is remain calm, and grounded in practicalities.The rumors state that no visitor to the Dreamers Inn has ever been a guest for more than one night. Even those travelers who have spent that brief length of time within its walls have departed without a word, in a mad frenzy of escape. Ive lived in Leight all my life, and have no reason to pay for a room when Im safe enough in my late fathers house. Nevertheless, I intend to stay not for one night, but three. I shall prove the chatter of my fellow citizens to be foolish gossip, once and for all, and bring more business to the Inn. I receive a share of its profits, being the only living descendant of its owners throughout the generations.Fathers pension is barely holding out, and with a bitter chill in the air, I need some more money for winter."]}

A Nightmare and a Cataclysm1.And now swiftly followed that hideous experience which has left its indelible mark of fear on the soul of Marinus Bicknell Willett, and has added a decade to the visible age of one whose youth was even then far behind. Dr. Willett had conferred at length with Mr. Ward, and had come to an agreement with him on several points which both felt the alienists would ridicule. There was, they conceded, a terrible movement alive in the world, whose direct connexion with a necromancy even older than the Salem witchcraft could not be doubted. That at least two living men - and one other of whom they dared not think - were in absolute possession of minds or personalities which had functioned as early as 1690 or before was likewise almost unassailably proved even in the face of all known natural laws. What these horrible creatures - and Charles Ward as well - were doing or trying to do seemed fairly clear from their letters and from every bit of light both old and new which had filtered in upon the case. They were robbing the tombs of all the ages, including those of the worlds wisest and greatest men, in the hope of recovering from the bygone ashes some vestige of the consciousness and lore which had once animated and informed them.      A hideous traffick was going on among these nightmare ghouls, whereby illustrious bones were bartered with the calm calculativeness of schoolboys swapping books; and from what was extorted from this centuried dust there was anticipated a power and a wisdom beyond anything which the cosmos had ever seen concentrated in one man or group. They had found unholy ways to keep their brains alive, either in the same body or different bodies; and had evidently achieved a way of tapping the consciousness of the dead whom they gathered together. There had, it seems, been some truth in chimerical old Borellus when he wrote of preparing from even the most antique remains certain \"Essential Saltes\" from which the shade of a long-dead living thing might be raised up. There was a formula for evoking such a shade, and another for putting it down; and it had now been so perfected that it could be taught successfully. One must be careful about evocations, for the markers of old graves are not always accurate.      Willett and Mr. Ward shivered as they passed from conclusion to conclusion. Things - presences or voices of some sort - could be drawn down from unknown places as well as from the grave, and in this process also one must be careful. Joseph Curwen had indubitably evoked many forbidden things, and as for Charles - what might one think of him? What forces \"outside the spheres\" had reached him from Joseph Curwens day and turned his mind on forgotten things? He had been led to find certain directions, and he had used them. He had talked with the man of horror in Prague and stayed long with the creature in the mountains of Transylvania. And he must have found the grave of Joseph Curwen at last. That newspaper item and what his mother had heard in the night were too significant to overlook. Then he had summoned something, and it must have come. That mighty voice aloft on Good Friday, and those different tones in the locked attic laboratory. What were they like, with their depth and hollowness? Was there not here some awful foreshadowing of the dreaded stranger Dr. Allen with his spectral bass? Yes, that was what Mr. Ward had felt with vague horror in his single talk with the man - if man it were - over the telephone!      What hellish consciousness or voice, what morbid shade or presence, had come to answer Charles Wards secret rites behind that locked door? Those voices heard in argument - \"must have it red for three months\" - Good God! Was not that just before the vampirism broke out? The rifling of Ezra Weedens ancient grave, and the cries later at Pawtuxet - whose mind had planned the vengeance and rediscovered the shunned seat of elder blasphemies? And then the bungalow and the bearded stranger, and the gossip, and the fear. The final madness of Charles neither father nor doctor could attempt to explain, but they did feel sure that the mind of Joseph Curwen had come to earth again and was following its ancient morbidities. Was daemoniac possession in truth a possibility? Allen had something to do with it, and the detectives must find out more about one whose existence menaced the young mans life. In the meantime, since the existence of some vast crypt beneath the bungalow seemed virtually beyond dispute, some effort must be made to find it. Willett and Mr. Ward, conscious of the sceptical attitude of the alienists, resolved during their final conference to undertake a joint secret exploration of unparalleled thoroughness; and agreed to meet at the bungalow on the following morning with valises and with certain tools and accessories suited to architectural search and underground exploration.      The morning of April 6th dawned clear, and both explorers were at the bungalow by ten oclock. Mr. Ward had the key, and an entry and cursory survey were made. From the disordered condition of Dr. Allens room it was obvious that the detectives had been there before, and the later searchers hoped that they had found some clue which might prove of value. Of course the main business lay in the cellar; so thither they descended without much delay, again making the circuit which each had vainly made before in the presence of the mad young owner. For a time everything seemed baffling, each inch of the earthen floor and stone walls having so solid and innocuous an aspect that the thought of a yawning aperture was scarcely to be entertained. Willett reflected that since the original cellar was dug without knowledge of any catacombs beneath, the beginning of the passage would represent the strictly modern delving of young Ward and his associates, where they had probed for the ancient vaults whose rumour could have reached them by no wholesome means.      The doctor tried to put himself in Charless place to see how a delver would be likely to start, but could not gain much inspiration from this method. Then he decided on elimination as a policy, and went carefully over the whole subterranean surface both vertical and horizontal, trying to account for every inch separately. He was soon substantially narrowed down, and at last had nothing left but the small platform before the washtubs, which he had tried once before in vain. Now experimenting in every possible way, and exerting a double strength, he finally found that the top did indeed turn and slide horizontally on a corner pivot. Beneath it lay a trim concrete surface with an iron manhole, to which Mr. Ward at once rushed with excited zeal. The cover was not hard to lift, and the father had quite removed it when Willett noticed the queerness of his aspect. He was swaying and nodding dizzily, and in the gust of noxious air which swept up from the black pit beneath the doctor soon recognised ample cause.      In a moment Dr. Willett had his fainting companion on the floor above and was reviving him with cold water. Mr. Ward responded feebly, but it could be seen that the mephitic blast from the crypt had in some way gravely sickened him. Wishing to take no chances, Willett hastened out to Broad Street for a taxicab and had soon dispatched the sufferer home despite his weak-voiced protests; after which he produced an electric torch, covered his nostrils with a band of sterile gauze, and descended once more to peer into the new-found depths. The foul air had now slightly abated, and Willett was able to send a beam of light down the Stygian hole. For about ten feet, he saw, it was a sheer cylindrical drop with concrete walls and an iron ladder; after which the hole appeared to strike a flight of old stone steps which must originally have emerged to earth somewhat southwest of the present building.2.      Willett freely admits that for a moment the memory of the old Curwen legends kept him from climbing down alone into that malodorous gulf. He could not help thinking of what Luke Fenner had reported on that last monstrous night. Then duty asserted itself and he made the plunge, carrying a great valise for the removal of whatever papers might prove of supreme importance. Slowly, as befitted one of his years, he descended the ladder and reached the slimy steps below. This was ancient masonry, his torch told him; and upon the dripping walls he saw the unwholesome moss of centuries. Down, down, ran the steps; not spirally, but in three abrupt turns; and with such narrowness that two men could have passed only with difficulty. He had counted about thirty when a sound reached him very faintly; and after that he did not feel disposed to count any more.      It was a godless sound; one of those low-keyed, insidious outrages of Nature which are not meant to be. To call it a dull wail, a doom-dragged whine, or a hopeless howl of chorused anguish and stricken flesh without mind would be to miss its most quintessential loathsomeness and soul-sickening overtones. Was it for this that Ward had seemed to listen on that day he was removed? It was the most shocking thing that Willett had ever heard, and it continued from no determinate point as the doctor reached the bottom of the steps and cast his torchlight around on lofty corridor walls surmounted by Cyclopean vaulting and pierced by numberless black archways. The hall in which he stood was perhaps fourteen feet high to the middle of the vaulting and ten or twelve feet broad. Its pavement was of large chipped flagstones, and its walls and roof were of dressed masonry. Its length he could not imagine, for it stretched ahead indefinitely into the blackness. Of the archways, some had doors of the old six-panelled colonial type, whilst others had none.      Overcoming the dread induced by the smell and the howling, Willett began to explore these archways one by one; finding beyond them rooms with groined stone ceilings, each of medium size and apparently of bizarre uses. Most of them had fireplaces, the upper courses of whose chimneys would have formed an interesting study in engineering. Never before or since had he seen such instruments or suggestions of instruments as here loomed up on every hand through the burying dust and cobwebs of a century and a half, in many cases evidently shattered as if by the ancient raiders. For many of the chambers seemed wholly untrodden by modern feet, and must have represented the earliest and most obsolete phases of Joseph Curwens experimentation. Finally there came a room of obvious modernity, or at least of recent occupancy. There were oil heaters, bookshelves and tables, chairs and cabinets, and a desk piled high with papers of varying antiquity and contemporaneousness. Candlesticks and oil lamps stood about in several places; and finding a match-safe handy, Willett lighted such as were ready for use.      In the fuller gleam it appeared that this apartment was nothing less than the latest study or library of Charles Ward. Of the books the doctor had seen many before, and a good part of the furniture had plainly come from the Prospect Street mansion. Here and there was a piece well known to Willett, and the sense of familiarity became so great that he half forgot the noisomeness and the wailing, both of which were plainer here than they had been at the foot of the steps. His first duty, as planned long ahead, was to find and seize any papers which might seem of vital importance; especially those portentous documents found by Charles so long ago behind the picture in Olney Court. As he searched he perceived how stupendous a task the final unravelling would be; for file on file was stuffed with papers in curious hands and bearing curious designs, so that months or even years might be needed for a thorough deciphering and editing. Once he found large packets of letters with Prague and Rakus postmarks, and in writing clearly recognisable as Ornes and Hutchinsons; all of which he took with him as part of the bundle to be removed in his valise.      At last, in a locked mahogany cabinet once gracing the Ward home, Willett found the batch of old Curwen papers; recognising them from the reluctant glimpse Charles had granted him so many years ago. The youth had evidently kept them together very much as they had been when first he found them, since all the titles recalled by the workmen were present except the papers addressed to Orne and Hutchinson, and the cipher with its key. Willett placed the entire lot in his valise and continued his examination of the files. Since young Wards immediate condition was the greatest matter at stake, the closest searching was done among the most obviously recent matter; and in this abundance of contemporary manuscript one very baffling oddity was noted. The oddity was the slight amount in Charless normal writing, which indeed included nothing more recent than two months before. On the other hand, there were literally reams of symbols and formulae, historical notes and philosophical comment, in a crabbed penmanship absolutely identical with the ancient script of Joseph Curwen, though of undeniably modern dating. Plainly, a part of the latter-day programme had been a sedulous imitation of the old wizards writing, which Charles seemed to have carried to a marvellous state of perfection. Of any third hand which might have been Allens there was not a trace. If he had indeed come to be the leader, he must have forced young Ward to act as his amanuensis.      In this new material one mystic formula, or rather pair of formulae, recurred so often that Willett had it by heart before he had half finished his quest. It consisted of two parallel columns, the left-hand one surmounted by the archaic symbol called \"Dragons Head\" and used in almanacks to indicate the ascending node, and the right-hand one headed by a corresponding sign of \"Dragons Tail\" or descending node. The appearance of the whole was something like this, and almost unconsciously the doctor realised that the second half was no more than the first written syllabically backward with the exception of the final monosyllables and of the odd name Yog-Sothoth, which he had come to recognise under various spellings from other things he had seen in connexion with this horrible matter. The formulae were as follows - exactly so, as Willett is abundantly able to testify - and the first one struck an odd note of uncomfortable latent memory in his brain, which he recognised later when reviewing the events of that horrible Good Friday of the previous year.YAI NGNGAH,YOG-SOTHOTHHEE - LGEBFAI THRODOGUAAAH      \tOGTHROD AIFGEBL - EEHYOG-SOTHOTHNGAHNG AIYZHROSo haunting were these formulae, and so frequently did he come upon them, that before the doctor knew it he was repeating them under his breath. Eventually, however, he felt he had secured all the papers he could digest to advantage for the present; hence resolved to examine no more till he could bring the sceptical alienists en masse for an ampler and more systematic raid. He had still to find the hidden laboratory, so leaving his valise in the lighted room he emerged again into the black noisome corridor whose vaulting echoed ceaselessly with that dull and hideous whine.      The next few rooms he tried were all abandoned, or filled only with crumbling boxes and ominous-looking leaden coffins; but impressed him deeply with the magnitude of Joseph Curwens original operations. He thought of the slaves and seamen who had disappeared, of the graves which had been violated in every part of the world, and of what that final raiding party must have seen; and then he decided it was better not to think any more. Once a great stone staircase mounted at his right, and he deduced that this must have reached to one of the Curwen outbuildings - perhaps the famous stone edifice with the high slit-like windows - provided the steps he had descended had led from the steep-roofed farmhouse. Suddenly the walls seemed to fall away ahead, and the stench and the wailing grew stronger. Willett saw that he had come upon a vast open space, so great that his torchlight would not carry across it; and as he advanced he encountered occasional stout pillars supporting the arches of the roof.      After a time he reached a circle of pillars grouped like the monoliths of Stonehenge, with a large carved altar on a base of three steps in the centre; and so curious were the carvings on that altar that he approached to study them with his electric light. But when he saw what they were he shrank away shuddering, and did not stop to investigate the dark stains which discoloured the upper surface and had spread down the sides in occasional thin lines. Instead, he found the distant wall and traced it as it swept round in a gigantic circle perforated by occasional black doorways and indented by a myriad of shallow cells with iron gratings and wrist and ankle bonds on chains fastened to the stone of the concave rear masonry. These cells were empty, but still the horrible odour and the dismal moaning continued, more insistent now than ever, and seemingly varied at times by a sort of slippery thumping.3.      From that frightful smell and that uncanny noise Willetts attention could no longer be diverted. Both were plainer and more hideous in the great pillared hall than anywhere else, and carried a vague impression of being far below, even in this dark nether world of subterrene mystery. Before trying any of the black archways for steps leading further down, the doctor cast his beam of light about the stone-flagged floor. It was very loosely paved, and at irregular intervals there would occur a slab curiously pierced by small holes in no definite arrangement, while at one point there lay a very long ladder carelessly flung down. To this ladder, singularly enough, appeared to cling a particularly large amount of the frightful odour which encompassed everything. As he walked slowly about it suddenly occurred to Willett that both the noise and the odour seemed strongest directly above the oddly pierced slabs, as if they might be crude trap-doors leading down to some still deeper region of horror. Kneeling by one, he worked at it with his hands, and found that with extreme difficulty he could budge it. At his touch the moaning beneath ascended to a louder key, and only with vast trepidation did he persevere in the lifting of the heavy stone. A stench unnamable now rose up from below, and the doctors head reeled dizzily as he laid back the slab and turned his torch upon the exposed square yard of gaping blackness.      If he had expected a flight of steps to some wide gulf of ultimate abomination, Willett was destined to be disappointed; for amidst that foetor and cracked whining he discerned only the brick-faced top of a cylindrical well perhaps a yard and a half in diameter and devoid of any ladder or other means of descent. As the light shone down, the wailing changed suddenly to a series of horrible yelps; in conjunction with which there came again that sound of blind, futile scrambling and slippery thumping. The explorer trembled, unwilling even to imagine what noxious thing might be lurking in that abyss, but in a moment mustered up the courage to peer over the rough-hewn brink; lying at full length and holding the torch downward at arms length to see what might lie below. For a second he could distinguish nothing but the slimy, moss-grown brick walls sinking illimitably into that half-tangible miasma of murk and foulness and anguished frenzy; and then he saw that something dark was leaping clumsily and frantically up and down at the bottom of the narrow shaft, which must have been from twenty to twenty-five feet below the stone floor where he lay. The torch shook in his hand, but he looked again to see what manner of living creature might be immured there in the darkness of that unnatural well; left starving by young Ward through all the long month since the doctors had taken him away, and clearly only one of a vast number prisoned in the kindred wells whose pierced stone covers so thickly studded in the floor of the great vaulted cavern. Whatever the things were, they could not lie down in their cramped spaces; but must have crouched and whined and waited and feebly leaped all those hideous weeks since their master had abandoned them unheeded.      But Marinus Bicknell Willett was sorry that he looked again; for surgeon and veteran of the dissecting-room though he was, he has not been the same since. It is hard to explain just how a single sight of a tangible object with measureable dimensions could so shake and change a man; and we may only say that there is about certain outlines and entities a power of symbolism and suggestion which acts frightfully on a sensitive thinkers perspective and whispers terrible hints of obscure cosmic relationships and unnamable realities behind the protective illusions of common vision. In that second look Willett saw such an outline or entity, for during the next few instants he was undoubtedly as stark mad as any inmate of Dr. Waites private hospital. He dropped the electric torch from a hand drained of muscular power or nervous cordination, nor heeded the sound of crunching teeth which told of its fate at the bottom of the pit. He screamed and screamed and screamed in a voice whose falsetto panic no acquaintance of his would ever have recognised; and though he could not rise to his feet he crawled and rolled desperately away over the damp pavement where dozens of Tartarean wells poured forth their exhausted whining and yelping to answer his own insane cries. He tore his hands on the rough, loose stones, and many times bruised his head against the frequent pillars, but still he kept on. Then at last he slowly came to himself in the utter blackness and stench, and stopped his ears against the droning wail into which the burst of yelping had subsided. He was drenched with perspiration and without means of producing a light; stricken and unnerved in the abysmal blackness and horror, and crushed with a memory he never could efface. Beneath him dozens of those things still lived, and from one of the shafts the cover was removed. He knew that what he had seen could never climb up the slippery walls, yet shuddered at the thought that some obscure foot-hold might exist.      What the thing was, he would never tell. It was like some of the carvings on the hellish altar, but it was alive. Nature had never made it in this form, for it was too palpably unfinished. The deficiencies were of the most surprising sort, and the abnormalities of proportion could not be described. Willett consents only to say that this type of thing must have represented entities which Ward called up from imperfect salts, and which he kept for servile or ritualistic purposes. If it had not had a certain significance, its image would not have been carved on that damnable stone. It was not the worst thing depicted on that stone - but Willett never opened the other pits. At the time, the first connected idea in his mind was an idle paragraph from some of the old Curwen data he had digested long before; a phrase used by Simon or Jedediah Orne in that portentous confiscated letter to the bygone sorcerer: \"Certainely, there was Nothg butt ye liveliest Awfulness in that which H. raisd upp from What he coud gather onlie a part of.\"      Then, horribly supplementing rather than displacing this image, there came a recollection of those ancient lingering rumours anent the burned, twisted thing found in the fields a week after the Curwen raid. Charles Ward had once told the doctor what old Slocum said of that object; that it was neither thoroughly human, nor wholly allied to any animal which Pawtuxet folk had ever seen or read about.      These words hummed in the doctors mind as he rocked to and fro, squatting on the nitrous stone floor. He tried to drive them out, and repeated the Lords Prayer to himself; eventually trailing off into a mnemonic hodge-podge like the modernistic Waste Land of Mr. T. S. Eliot and finally reverting to the oft-repeated dual formula he had lately found in Wards underground library: \"Yai ngngah, Yog-Sothoth\", and so on till the final underlined \"Zhro\". It seemed to soothe him, and he staggered to his feet after a time; lamenting bitterly his fright-lost torch and looking wildly about for any gleam of light in the clutching inkiness of the chilly air. Think he would not; but he strained his eyes in every direction for some faint glint or reflection of the bright illumination he had left in the library. After a while he thought he detected a suspicion of a glow infinitely far away, and toward this he crawled in agonised caution on hands and knees amidst the stench and howling, always feeling ahead lest he collide with the numerous great pillars or stumble into the abominable pit he had uncovered.      Once his shaking fingers touched something which he knew must be the steps leading to the hellish altar, and from this spot he recoiled in loathing. At another time he encountered the pierced slab he had removed, and here his caution became almost pitiful. But he did not come upon the dread aperture after all, nor did anything issue from that aperture to detain him. What had been down there made no sound nor stir. Evidently its crunching of the fallen electric torch had not been good for it. Each time Willetts fingers felt a perforated slab he trembled. His passage over it would sometimes increase the groaning below, but generally it would produce no effect at all, since he moved very noiselessly. Several times during his progress the glow ahead diminished perceptibly, and he realised that the various candles and lamps he had left must be expiring one by one. The thought of being lost in utter darkness without matches amidst this underground world of nightmare labyrinths impelled him to rise to his feet and run, which he could safely do now that he had passed the open pit; for he knew that once the light failed, his only hope of rescue and survival would lie in whatever relief party Mr. Ward might send after missing him for a sufficient period. Presently, however, he emerged from the open space into the narrower corridor and definitely located the glow as coming from a door on his right. In a moment he had reached it and was standing once more in young Wards secret library, trembling with relief, and watching the sputterings of that last lamp which had brought him to safety.4.      In another moment he was hastily filling the burned-out lamps from an oil supply he had previously noticed, and when the room was bright again he looked about to see if he might find a lantern for further exploration. For racked though he was with horror, his sense of grim purpose was still uppermost; and he was firmly determined to leave no stone unturned in his search for the hideous facts behind Charles Wards bizarre madness. Failing to find a lantern, he chose the smallest of the lamps to carry; also filling his pockets with candles and matches, and taking with him a gallon can of oil, which he proposed to keep for reserve use in whatever hidden laboratory he might uncover beyond the terrible open space with its unclean altar and nameless covered wells. To traverse that space again would require his utmost fortitude, but he knew it must be done. Fortunately neither the frightful altar nor the opened shaft was near the vast cell-indented wall which bounded the cavern area, and whose black mysterious archways would form the next goals of a logical search.      So Willett went back to that great pillared hall of stench and anguished howling; turning down his lamp to avoid any distant glimpse of the hellish altar, or of the uncovered pit with the pierced stone slab beside it. Most of the black doorways led merely to small chambers, some vacant and some evidently used as storerooms; and in several of the latter he saw some very curious accumulations of various objects. One was packed with rotting and dust-draped bales of spare clothing, and the explorer thrilled when he saw that it was unmistakably the clothing of a century and a half before. In another room he found numerous odds and ends of modern clothing, as if gradual provisions were being made to equip a large body of men. But what he disliked most of all were the huge copper vats which occasionally appeared; these, and the sinister incrustations upon them. He liked them even less than the weirdly figured leaden bowls whose rims retained such obnoxious deposits and around which clung repellent odours perceptible above even the general noisomeness of the crypt. When he had completed about half the entire circuit of the wall he found another corridor like that from which he had come, and out of which many doors opened. This he proceeded to investigate; and after entering three rooms of medium size and of no significant contents, he came at last to a large oblong apartment whose business-like tanks and tables, furnaces and modern instruments, occasional books and endless shelves of jars and bottles proclaimed it indeed the long-sought laboratory of Charles Ward - and no doubt of old Joseph Curwen before him.      After lighting the three lamps which he found filled and ready, Dr. Willett examined the place and all its appurtenances with the keenest interest; noting from the relative quantities of various reagents on the shelves that young Wards dominant concern must have been with some branch of organic chemistry. On the whole, little could be learned from the scientific ensemble, which included a gruesome-looking dissecting table; so that the room was really rather a disappointment. Among the books was a tattered old copy of Borellus in black-letter, and it was weirdly interesting to note that Ward had underlined the same passage whose marking had so perturbed good Mr. Merritt at Curwens farmhouse more than a century and a half before. That older copy, of course, must have perished along with the rest of Curwens occult library in the final raid. Three archways opened off the laboratory, and these the doctor proceeded to sample in turn. From his cursory survey he saw that two led merely to small storerooms; but these he canvassed with care, remarking the piles of coffins in various stages of damage and shuddering violently at two or three of the few coffin-plates he could decipher. There was much clothing also stored in these rooms, and several new and tightly nailed boxes which he did not stop to investigate. Most interesting of all, perhaps, were some odd bits which he judged to be fragments of old Joseph Curwens laboratory appliances. These had suffered damage at the hands of the raiders, but were still partly recognisable as the chemical paraphernalia of the Georgian period.      The third archway led to a very sizeable chamber entirely lined with shelves and having in the centre a table bearing two lamps. These lamps Willett lighted, and in their brilliant glow studied the endless shelving which surrounded him. Some of the upper levels were wholly vacant, but most of the space was filled with small odd-looking leaden jars of two general types; one tall and without handles like a Grecian lekythos or oil-jug, and the other with a single handle and proportioned like a Phaleron jug. All had metal stoppers, and were covered with peculiar-looking symbols moulded in low relief. In a moment the doctor noticed that these jugs were classified with great rigidity; all the lekythoi being on one side of the room with a large wooden sign reading \"Custodes\" above them, and all the Phalerons on the other, correspondingly labelled with a sign reading \"Materia\". Each of the jars or jugs, except some on the upper shelves that turned out to be vacant, bore a cardboard tag with a number apparently referring to a catalogue; and Willett resolved to look for the latter presently. For the moment, however, he was more interested in the nature of the array as a whole; and experimentally opened several of the lekythoi and Phalerons at random with a view to a rough generalisation. The result was invariable. Both types of jar contained a small quantity of a single kind of substance; a fine dusty powder of very light weight and of many shades of dull, neutral colour. To the colours which formed the only point of variation there was no apparent method of disposal; and no distinction between what occurred in the lekythoi and what occurred in the Phalerons. A bluish-grey powder might be by the side of a pinkish-white one, and any one in a Phaleron might have its exact counterpart in a lekythos. The most individual feature about the powders was their non-adhesiveness. Willett would pour one into his hand, and upon returning it to its jug would find that no residue whatever remained on its palm.      The meaning of the two signs puzzled him, and he wondered why this battery of chemicals was separated so radically from those in glass jars on the shelves of the laboratory proper. \"Custodes\", \"Materia\"; that was the Latin for \"Guards\" and \"Materials\", respectively - and then there came a flash of memory as to where he had seen that word \"Guards\" before in connexion with this dreadful mystery. It was, of course, in the recent letter to Dr. Allen purporting to be from old Edward Hutchinson; and the phrase had read: \"There was no Neede to keep the Guards in Shape and eatg off their Heads, and it made Much to be founde in Case of Trouble, as you too welle knowe.\" What did this signify? But wait - was there not still another reference to \"guards\" in this matter which he had failed wholly to recall when reading the Hutchinson letter? Back in the old non-secretive days Ward had told him of the Eleazar Smith diary recording the spying of Smith and Weeden on the Curwen farm, and in that dreadful chronicle there had been a mention of conversations overheard before the old wizard betook himself wholly beneath the earth. There had been, Smith and Weeden insisted, terrible colloquies wherein figured Curwen, certain captives of his, and the guards of those captives. Those guards, according to Hutchinson or his avatar, had eaten their heads off, so that now Dr. Allen did not keep them in shape. And if not in shape, how save as the \"salts\" to which it appears this wizard band was engaged in reducing as many human bodies or skeletons as they could?      So that was what these lekythoi contained; the monstrous fruit of unhallowed rites and deeds, presumably won or cowed to such submission as to help, when called up by some hellish incantation, in the defence of their blasphemous master or the questioning of those who were not so willing? Willett shuddered at the thought of what he had been pouring in and out of his hands, and for a moment felt an impulse to flee in panic from that cavern of hideous shelves with their silent and perhaps watching sentinels. Then he thought of the \"Materia\" - in the myriad Phaleron jugs on the other side of the room. Salts too - and if not the salts of \"guards\", then the salts of what? God! Could it be possible that here lay the mortal relics of half the titan thinkers of all the ages; snatched by supreme ghouls from crypts where the world thought them safe, and subject to the beck and call of madmen who sought to drain their knowledge for some still wilder end whose ultimate effect would concern, as poor Charles had hinted in his frantic note, all civilisation, all natural law, perhaps even the fate of the solar system and the universe? And Marinus Bicknell Willett had sifted their dust through his hands!      Then he noticed a small door at the farther end of the room, and calmed himself enough to approach it and examine the crude sign chiselled above. It was only a symbol, but it filled him with vague spiritual dread; for a morbid, dreaming friend of his had once drawn it on paper and told him a few of the things it means in the dark abyss of sleep. It was the sign of Koth, that dreamers see fixed above the archway of a certain black tower standing alone in twilight - and Willett did not like what his friend Randolph Carter had said of its powers. But a moment later he forgot the sign as he recognised a new acrid odour in the stench-filled air. This was a chemical rather than animal smell, and came clearly from the room beyond the door. And it was, unmistakably, the same odour which had saturated Charles Wards clothing on the day the doctors had taken him away. So it was here that the youth had been interrupted by the final summons? He was wiser than old Joseph Curwen, for he had not resisted. Willett, boldly determined to penetrate every wonder and nightmare this nether realm might contain, seized the small lamp and crossed the threshold. A wave of nameless fright rolled out to meet him, but he yielded to no whim and deferred to no intuition. There was nothing alive here to harm him, and he would not be stayed in his piercing of the eldritch cloud which engulfed his patient.      The room beyond the door was of medium size, and had no furniture save a table, a single chair, and two groups of curious machines with clamps and wheels, which Willett recognised after a moment as mediaeval instruments of torture. On one side of the door stood a rack of savage whips, above which were some shelves bearing empty rows of shallow pedestalled cups of lead shaped like Grecian kylikes. On the other side was the table; with a powerful Argand lamp, a pad and pencil, and two of the stoppered lekythoi from the shelves outside set down at irregular places as if temporarily or in haste. Willett lighted the lamp and looked carefully at the pad, to see what notes young Ward might have been jotting down when interrupted; but found nothing more intelligible than the following disjointed fragments in that crabbed Curwen chirography, which shed no light on the case as a whole:\"B. dyd not. Escapd into walls and founde Place below.\"Saw olde V. saye ye Sabaoth and learnt ye Way.\"Raisd Yog-Sothoth thrice and was ye nexte Day deliverd.\"F. soughte to wipe out all knowg howe to raise Those from Outside.\"      As the strong Argand blaze lit up the entire chamber the doctor saw that the wall opposite the door, between the two groups of torturing appliances in the corners, was covered with pegs from which hung a set of shapeless-looking robes of a rather dismal yellowish-white. But far more interesting were the two vacant walls, both of which were thickly covered with mystic symbols and formulae roughly chiselled in the smooth dressed stone. The damp floor also bore marks of carving; and with but little difficulty Willett deciphered a huge pentagram in the centre, with a plain circle about three feet wide half way between this and each corner. In one of these four circles, near where a yellowish robe had been flung carelessly down, there stood a shallow kylix of the sort found on the shelves above the whip-rack; and just outside the periphery was one of the Phaleron jugs from the shelves in the other room, its tag numbered 118. This was unstoppered, and proved upon inspection to be empty; but the explorer saw with a shiver that the kylix was not. Within its shallow area, and saved from scattering only by the absence of wind in this sequestered cavern, lay a small amount of a dry, dull-greenish efflorescent powder which must have belonged in the jug; and Willett almost reeled at the implications that came sweeping over him as he correlated little by little the several elements and antecedents of the scene. The whips and the instruments of torture, the dust or salts from the jug of \"Materia\", the two lekythoi from the \"Custodes\" shelf, the robes, the formulae on the walls, the notes on the pad, the hints from letters and legends, and the thousand glimpses, doubts, and suppositions which had come to torment the friends and parents of Charles Ward - all these engulfed the doctor in a tidal wave of horror as he looked at that dry greenish powder outspread in the pedestalled leaden kylix on the floor.      With an effort, however, Willett pulled himself together and began studying the formulae chiselled on the walls. From the stained and incrusted letters it was obvious that they were carved in Joseph Curwens time, and their text was such as to be vaguely familiar to one who had read much Curwen material or delved extensively into the history of magic. One the doctor clearly recognised as what Mrs. Ward heard her son chanting on that ominous Good Friday a year before, and what an authority had told him was a very terrible invocation addressed to secret gods outside the normal spheres. It was not spelled here exactly as Mrs. Ward had set it down from memory, nor yet as the authority had shewn it to him in the forbidden pages of \"Eliphas Levi\"; but its identity was unmistakable, and such words as Sabaoth, Metraton, Almousin, and Zariatnatmik sent a shudder of fright through the searcher who had seen and felt so much of cosmic abomination just around the corner.      This was on the left-hand wall as one entered the room. The right-hand wall was no less thickly inscribed, and Willett felt a start of recognition as he came upon the pair of formulae so frequently occurring in the recent notes in the library. They were, roughly speaking, the same; with the ancient symbols of \"Dragons Head\" and \"Dragons Tail\" heading them as in Wards scribblings. But the spelling differed quite widely from that of the modern versions, as if old Curwen had had a different way of recording sound, or as if later study had evolved more powerful and perfected variants of the invocations in question. The doctor tried to reconcile the chiselled version with the one which still ran persistently in his head, and found it hard to do. Where the script he had memorised began \"Yai ngngah, Yog-Sothoth\", this epigraph started out as \"Aye, engengah, Yogge-Sothotha\"; which to his mind would seriously interfere with the syllabification of the second word.      Ground as the later text was into his consciousness, the discrepancy disturbed him; and he found himself chanting the first of the formulae aloud in an effort to square the sound he conceived with the letters he found carved. Weird and menacing in that abyss of antique blasphemy rang his voice; its accents keyed to a droning sing-song either through the spell of the past and the unknown, or through the hellish example of that dull, godless wail from the pits whose inhuman cadences rose and fell rhythmically in the distance through the stench and the darkness.\"YAI NGNGAH,YOG-SOTHOTHHEE - LGEBFAI THRODOGUAAAH!\"      But what was this cold wind which had sprung into life at the very outset of the chant? The lamps were sputtering woefully, and the gloom grew so dense that the letters on the wall nearly faded from sight. There was smoke, too, and an acrid odour which quite drowned out the stench from the far-away wells; an odour like that he had smelt before, yet infinitely stronger and more pungent. He turned from the inscriptions to face the room with its bizarre contents, and saw that the kylix on the floor, in which the ominous efflorescent powder had lain, was giving forth a cloud of thick, greenish-black vapour of surprising volume and opacity. That powder - Great God! it had come from the shelf of \"Materia\" - what was it doing now, and what had started it? The formula he had been chanting - the first of the pair - Dragons Head, ascending node - Blessed Saviour, could it be. . . .      The doctor reeled, and through his head raced wildly disjointed scraps from all he had seen, heard, and read of the frightful case of Joseph Curwen and Charles Dexter Ward. \"I say to you againe, doe not call up Any that you can not put downe. . . . Have ye Wordes for laying at all times readie, and stopp not to be sure when there is any Doubte of Whom you have. . . . Three Talkes with What was therein inhumd. . . .\" Mercy of Heaven, what is that shape behind the parting smoke?5.      Marinus Bicknell Willett has no hope that any part of his tale will be believed except by certain sympathetic friends, hence he has made no attempt to tell it beyond his most intimate circle. Only a few outsiders have ever heard it repeated, and of these the majority laugh and remark that the doctor surely is getting old. He has been advised to take a long vacation and to shun future cases dealing with mental disturbance. But Mr. Ward knows that the veteran physician speaks only a horrible truth. Did not he himself see the noisome aperture in the bungalow cellar? Did not Willett send him home overcome and ill at eleven oclock that portentous morning? Did he not telephone the doctor in vain that evening, and again the next day, and had he not driven to the bungalow itself on that following noon, finding his friend unconscious but unharmed on one of the beds upstairs? Willett had been breathing stertorously, and opened his eyes slowly when Mr. Ward gave him some brandy fetched from the car. Then he shuddered and screamed, crying out, \"That beard . . . those eyes. . . . God, who are you?\" A very strange thing to say to a trim, blue-eyed, clean-shaven gentleman whom he had known from the latters boyhood.      In the bright noon sunlight the bungalow was unchanged since the previous morning. Willetts clothing bore no disarrangement beyond certain smudges and worn places at the knees, and only a faint acrid odour reminded Mr. Ward of what he had smelt on his son that day he was taken to the hospital. The doctors flashlight was missing, but his valise was safely there, as empty as when he had brought it. Before indulging in any explanations, and obviously with great moral effort, Willett staggered dizzily down to the cellar and tried the fateful platform before the tubs. It was unyielding. Crossing to where he had left his yet unused tool satchel the day before, he obtained a chisel and began to pry up the stubborn planks one by one. Underneath the smooth concrete was still visible, but of any opening or perforation there was no longer a trace. Nothing yawned this time to sicken the mystified father who had followed the doctor downstairs; only the smooth concrete underneath the planks - no noisome well, no world of subterrene horrors, no secret library, no Curwen papers, no nightmare pits of stench and howling, no laboratory or shelves or chiselled formulae, no. . . . Dr. Willett turned pale, and clutched at the younger man. \"Yesterday,\" he asked softly, \"did you see it here . . . and smell it?\" And when Mr. Ward, himself transfixed with dread and wonder, found strength to nod an affirmative, the physician gave a sound half a sigh and half a gasp, and nodded in turn. \"Then I will tell you,\" he said.      So for an hour, in the sunniest room they could find upstairs, the physician whispered his frightful tale to the wondering father. There was nothing to relate beyond the looming up of that form when the greenish-black vapour from the kylix parted, and Willett was too tired to ask himself what had really occurred. There were futile, bewildered head-shakings from both men, and once Mr. Ward ventured a hushed suggestion, \"Do you suppose it would be of any use to dig?\" The doctor was silent, for it seemed hardly fitting for any human brain to answer when powers of unknown spheres had so vitally encroached on this side of the Great Abyss. Again Mr. Ward asked, \"But where did it go? It brought you here, you know, and it sealed up the hole somehow.\" And Willett again let silence answer for him.      But after all, this was not the final phase of the matter. Reaching for his handkerchief before rising to leave, Dr. Willetts fingers closed upon a piece of paper in his pocket which had not been there before, and which was companioned by the candles and matches he had seized in the vanished vault. It was a common sheet, torn obviously from the cheap pad in that fabulous room of horror somewhere underground, and the writing upon it was that of an ordinary lead pencil - doubtless the one which had lain beside the pad. It was folded very carelessly, and beyond the faint acrid scent of the cryptic chamber bore no print or mark of any world but this. But in the text itself it did indeed reek with wonder; for here was no script of any wholesome age, but the laboured strokes of mediaeval darkness, scarcely legible to the laymen who now strained over it, yet having combinations of symbols which seemed vaguely familiar. The briefly scrawled message was this, and its mystery lent purpose to the shaken pair, who forthwith walked steadily out to the Ward car and gave orders to be driven first to a quiet dining place and then to the John Hay Library on the hill.      At the library it was easy to find good manuals of palaeography, and over these the two men puzzled till the lights of evening shone out from the great chandelier. In the end they found what was needed. The letters were indeed no fantastic invention, but the normal script of a very dark period. They were the pointed Saxon minuscules of the eighth or ninth century A.D., and brought with them memories of an uncouth time when under a fresh Christian veneer ancient faiths and ancient rites stirred stealthily, and the pale moon of Britain looked sometimes on strange deeds in the Roman ruins of Caerleon and Hexham, and by the towers along Hadrians crumbling wall. The words were in such Latin as a barbarous age might remember - \"Corvinus necandus est. Cadaver aq(ua) forti dissolvendum, nec aliq(ui)d retinendum. Tace ut potes.\" - which may roughly be translated, \"Curwen must be killed. The body must be dissolved in aqua fortis, nor must anything be retained. Keep silence as best you are able.\"      Willett and Mr. Ward were mute and baffled. They had met the unknown, and found that they lacked emotions to respond to it as they vaguely believed they ought. With Willett, especially, the capacity for receiving fresh impressions of awe was well-nigh exhausted; and both men sat still and helpless till the closing of the library forced them to leave. Then they drove listlessly to the Ward mansion in Prospect Street, and talked to no purpose into the night. The doctor rested toward morning, but did not go home. And he was still there Sunday noon when a telephone message came from the detectives who had been assigned to look up Dr. Allen.      Mr. Ward, who was pacing nervously about in a dressing-gown, answered the call in person; and told the men to come up early the next day when he heard their report was almost ready. Both Willett and he were glad that this phase of the matter was taking form, for whatever the origin of the strange minuscule message, it seemed certain that the \"Curwen\" who must be destroyed could be no other than the bearded and spectacled stranger. Charles had feared this man, and had said in the frantic note that he must be killed and dissolved in acid. Allen, moreover, had been receiving letters from the strange wizards in Europe under the name of Curwen, and palpably regarded himself as an avatar of the bygone necromancer. And now from a fresh and unknown source had come a message saying that \"Curwen\" must be killed and dissolved in acid. The linkage was too unmistakable to be factitious; and besides, was not Allen planning to murder young Ward upon the advice of the creature called Hutchinson? Of course, the letter they had seen had never reached the bearded stranger; but from its text they could see that Allen had already formed plans for dealing with the youth if he grew too squeamish. Without doubt, Allen must be apprehended; and even if the most drastic directions were not carried out, he must be placed where he could inflict no harm upon Charles Ward.      That afternoon, hoping against hope to extract some gleam of information anent the inmost mysteries from the only available one capable of giving it, the father and the doctor went down the bay and called on young Charles at the hospital. Simply and gravely Willett told him all he had found, and noticed how pale he turned as each description made certain the truth of the discovery. The physician employed as much dramatic effect as he could, and watched for a wincing on Charless part when he approached the matter of the covered pits and the nameless hybrids within. But Ward did not wince. Willett paused, and his voice grew indignant as he spoke of how the things were starving. He taxed the youth with shocking inhumanity, and shivered when only a sardonic laugh came in reply. For Charles, having dropped as useless his pretence that the crypt did not exist, seemed to see some ghastly jest in this affair; and chuckled hoarsely at something which amused him. Then he whispered, in accents doubly terrible because of the cracked voice he used, \"Damn em, they do eat, but they dont need to! Thats the rare part! A month, you say, without food? Lud, Sir, you be modest! Dye know, that was the joke on poor old Whipple with his virtuous bluster! Kill everything off, would he? Why, damme, he was half-deaf with the noise from Outside and never saw or heard aught from the wells! He never dreamed they were there at all! Devil take ye, those cursed things have been howling down there ever since Curwen was done for a hundred and fifty-seven years gone!\"      But no more than this could Willett get from the youth. Horrified, yet almost convinced against his will, he went on with his tale in the hope that some incident might startle his auditor out of the mad composure he maintained. Looking at the youths face, the doctor could not but feel a kind of terror at the changes which recent months had wrought. Truly, the boy had drawn down nameless horrors from the skies. When the room with the formulae and the greenish dust was mentioned, Charles shewed his first sign of animation. A quizzical look overspread his face as he heard what Willett had read on the pad, and he ventured the mild statement that those notes were old ones, of no possible significance to anyone not deeply initiated in the history of magic. \"But,\" he added, \"had you but known the words to bring up that which I had out in the cup, you had not been here to tell me this. Twas Number 118, and I conceive you would have shook had you looked it up in my list in tother room. Twas never raised by me, but I meant to have it up that day you came to invite me hither.\"      Then Willett told of the formula he had spoken and of the greenish-black smoke which had arisen; and as he did so he saw true fear dawn for the first time on Charles Wards face. \"It came, and you be here alive?\" As Ward croaked the words his voice seemed almost to burst free of its trammels and sink to cavernous abysses of uncanny resonance. Willett, gifted with a flash of inspiration, believed he saw the situation, and wove into his reply a caution from a letter he remembered. \"No. 118, you say? But dont forget that stones are all changed now in nine grounds out of ten. You are never sure till you question!\" And then, without warning, he drew forth the minuscule message and flashed it before the patients eyes. He could have wished no stronger result, for Charles Ward fainted forthwith.      All this conversation, of course, had been conducted with the greatest secrecy lest the resident alienists accuse the father and the physician of encouraging a madman in his delusions. Unaided, too, Dr. Willett and Mr. Ward picked up the stricken youth and placed him on the couch. In reviving, the patient mumbled many times of some word which he must get to Orne and Hutchinson at once; so when his consciousness seemed fully back the doctor told him that of those strange creatures at least one was his bitter enemy, and had given Dr. Allen advice for his assassination. This revelation produced no visible effect, and before it was made the visitors could see that their host had already the look of a hunted man. After that he would converse no more, so Willett and the father departed presently; leaving behind a caution against the bearded Allen, to which the youth only replied that this individual was very safely taken care of, and could do no one any harm even if he wished. This was said with an almost evil chuckle very painful to hear. They did not worry about any communications Charles might indite to that monstrous pair in Europe, since they knew that the hospital authorities seized all outgoing mail for censorship and would pass no wild or outr-looking missive.      There is, however, a curious sequel to the matter of Orne and Hutchinson, if such indeed the exiled wizards were. Moved by some vague presentiment amidst the horrors of that period, Willett arranged with an international press-cutting bureau for accounts of notable current crimes and accidents in Prague and in eastern Transylvania; and after six months believed that he had found two very significant things amongst the multifarious items he received and had translated. One was the total wrecking of a house by night in the oldest quarter of Prague, and the disappearance of the evil old man called Josef Nadek, who had dwelt in it alone ever since anyone could remember. The other was a titan explosion in the Transylvanian mountains east of Rakus, and the utter extirpation with all its inmates of the ill-regarded Castle Ferenczy, whose master was so badly spoken of by peasants and soldiery alike that he would shortly have been summoned to Bucharest for serious questioning had not this incident cut off a career already so long as to antedate all common memory. Willett maintains that the hand which wrote those minuscules was able to wield stronger weapons as well; and that while Curwen was left to him to dispose of, the writer felt able to find and deal with Orne and Hutchinson itself. Of what their fate may have been the doctor strives sedulously not to think.6.      The following morning Dr. Willett hastened to the Ward home to be present when the detectives arrived. Allens destruction or imprisonment - or Curwens, if one might regard the tacit claim to reincarnation as valid - he felt must be accomplished at any cost, and he communicated this conviction to Mr. Ward as they sat waiting for the men to come. They were downstairs this time, for the upper parts of the house were beginning to be shunned because of a peculiar nauseousness which hung indefinitely about; a nauseousness which the older servants connected with some curse left by the vanished Curwen portrait.      At nine oclock the three detectives presented themselves and immediately delivered all that they had to say. They had not, regrettably enough, located the Brava Tony Gomes as they had wished, nor had they found the least trace of Dr. Allens source or present whereabouts; but they had managed to unearth a considerable number of local impressions and facts concerning the reticent stranger. Allen had struck Pawtuxet people as a vaguely unnatural being, and there was an universal belief that his thick sandy beard was either dyed or false - a belief conclusively upheld by the finding of such a false beard, together with a pair of dark glasses, in his room at the fateful bungalow. His voice, Mr. Ward could well testify from his one telephone conversation, had a depth and hollowness that could not be forgotten; and his glance seemed malign even through his smoked and horn-rimmed glasses. One shopkeeper, in the course of negotiations, had seen a specimen of his handwriting and declared it was very queer and crabbed; this being confirmed by pencilled notes of no clear meaning found in his room and identified by the merchant. In connexion with the vampirism rumours of the preceding summer, a majority of the gossips believed that Allen rather than Ward was the actual vampire. Statements were also obtained from the officials who had visited the bungalow after the unpleasant incident of the motor truck robbery. They had felt less of the sinister in Dr. Allen, but had recognised him as the dominant figure in the queer shadowy cottage. The place had been too dark for them to observe him clearly, but they would know him again if they saw him. His beard had looked odd, and they thought he had some slight scar above his dark spectacled right eye. As for the detectives search of Allens room, it yielded nothing definite save the beard and glasses, and several pencilled notes in a crabbed writing which Willett at once saw was identical with that shared by the old Curwen manuscripts and by the voluminous recent notes of young Ward found in the vanished catacombs of horror.      Dr. Willett and Mr. Ward caught something of a profound, subtle, and insidious cosmic fear from this data as it was gradually unfolded, and almost trembled in following up the vague, mad thought which had simultaneously reached their minds. The false beard and glasses - the crabbed Curwen penmanship - the old portrait and its tiny scar - and the altered youth in the hospital with such a scar - that deep, hollow voice on the telephone - was it not of this that Mr. Ward was reminded when his son barked forth those pitiable tones to which he now claimed to be reduced? Who had ever seen Charles and Allen together? Yes, the officials had once, but who later on? Was it not when Allen left that Charles suddenly lost his growing fright and began to live wholly at the bungalow? Curwen - Allen - Ward - in what blasphemous and abominable fusion had two ages and two persons become involved? That damnable resemblance of the picture to Charles - had it not used to stare and stare, and follow the boy around the room with its eyes? Why, too, did both Allen and Charles copy Joseph Curwens handwriting, even when alone and off guard? And then the frightful work of those people - the lost crypt of horrors that had aged the doctor overnight; the starved monsters in the noisome pits; the awful formula which had yielded such nameless results; the message in minuscules found in Willetts pocket; the papers and the letters and all the talk of graves and \"salts\" and discoveries - whither did everything lead? In the end Mr. Ward did the most sensible thing. Steeling himself against any realisation of why he did it, he gave the detectives an article to be shewn to such Pawtuxet shopkeepers as had seen the portentous Dr. Allen. That article was a photograph of his luckless son, on which he now carefully drew in ink the pair of heavy glasses and the black pointed beard which the men had brought from Allens room.      For two hours he waited with the doctor in the oppressive house where fear and miasma were slowly gathering as the empty panel in the upstairs library leered and leered and leered. Then the men returned. Yes. The altered photograph was a very passable likeness of Dr. Allen. Mr. Ward turned pale, and Willett wiped a suddenly dampened brow with his handkerchief. Allen - Ward - Curwen - it was becoming too hideous for coherent thought. What had the boy called out of the void, and what had it done to him? What, really, had happened from first to last? Who was this Allen who sought to kill Charles as too squeamish, and why had his destined victim said in the postscript to that frantic letter that he must be so completely obliterated in acid? Why, too, had the minuscule message, of whose origin no one dared think, said that \"Curwen\" must be likewise obliterated? What was the change, and when had the final stage occurred? That day when his frantic note was received - he had been nervous all the morning, then there was an alteration. He had slipped out unseen and swaggered boldly in past the men hired to guard him. That was the time, when he was out. But no - had he not cried out in terror as he entered his study - this very room? What had he found there? Or wait - what had found him? That simulacrum which brushed boldly in without having been seen to go - was that an alien shadow and a horror forcing itself upon a trembling figure which had never gone out at all? Had not the butler spoken of queer noises?      Willett rang for the man and asked him some low-toned questions. It had, surely enough, been a bad business. There had been noises - a cry, a gasp, a choking, and a sort of clattering or creaking or thumping, or all of these. And Mr. Charles was not the same when he stalked out without a word. The butler shivered as he spoke, and sniffed at the heavy air that blew down from some open window upstairs. Terror had settled definitely upon the house, and only the business-like detectives failed to imbibe a full measure of it. Even they were restless, for this case had held vague elements in the background which pleased them not at all. Dr. Willett was thinking deeply and rapidly, and his thoughts were terrible ones. Now and then he would almost break into muttering as he ran over in his head a new, appalling, and increasingly conclusive chain of nightmare happenings.      Then Mr. Ward made a sign that the conference was over, and everyone save him and the doctor left the room. It was noon now, but shadows as of coming night seemed to engulf the phantom-haunted mansion. Willett began talking very seriously to his host, and urged that he leave a great deal of the future investigation to him. There would be, he predicted, certain obnoxious elements which a friend could bear better than a relative. As family physician he must have a free hand, and the first thing he required was a period alone and undisturbed in the abandoned library upstairs, where the ancient overmantel had gathered about itself an aura of noisome horror more intense than when Joseph Curwens features themselves glanced slyly down from the painted panel.      Mr. Ward, dazed by the flood of grotesque morbidities and unthinkably maddening suggestions that poured in upon him from every side, could only acquiesce; and half an hour later the doctor was locked in the shunned room with the panelling from Olney Court. The father, listening outside, heard fumbling sounds of moving and rummaging as the moments passed; and finally a wrench and a creak, as if a tight cupboard door were being opened. Then there was a muffled cry, a kind of snorting choke, and a hasty slamming of whatever had been opened. Almost at once the key rattled and Willett appeared in the hall, haggard and ghastly, and demanding wood for the real fireplace on the south wall of the room. The furnace was not enough, he said; and the electric log had little practical use. Longing yet not daring to ask questions, Mr. Ward gave the requisite orders and a man brought some stout pine logs, shuddering as he entered the tainted air of the library to place them in the grate. Willett meanwhile had gone up to the dismantled laboratory and brought down a few odds and ends not included in the moving of the July before. They were in a covered basket, and Mr. Ward never saw what they were.      Then the doctor locked himself in the library once more, and by the clouds of smoke which rolled down past the windows from the chimney it was known that he had lighted the fire. Later, after a great rustling of newspapers, that odd wrench and creaking were heard again; followed by a thumping which none of the eavesdroppers liked. Thereafter two suppressed cries of Willetts were heard, and hard upon these came a swishing rustle of indefinable hatefulness. Finally the smoke that the wind beat down from the chimney grew very dark and acrid, and everyone wished that the weather had spared them this choking and venomous inundation of peculiar fumes. Mr. Wards head reeled, and the servants all clustered together in a knot to watch the horrible black smoke swoop down. After an age of waiting the vapours seemed to lighten, and half-formless sounds of scraping, sweeping, and other minor operations were heard behind the bolted door. And at last, after the slamming of some cupboard within, Willett made his appearance - sad, pale, and haggard, and bearing the cloth-draped basket he had taken from the upstairs laboratory. He had left the window open, and into that once accursed room was pouring a wealth of pure, wholesome air to mix with a queer new smell of disinfectants. The ancient overmantel still lingered; but it seemed robbed of malignity now, and rose as calm and stately in its white panelling as if it had never borne the picture of Joseph Curwen. Night was coming on, yet this time its shadows held no latent fright, but only a gentle melancholy. Of what he had done the doctor would never speak. To Mr. Ward he said, \"I can answer no questions, but I will say that there are different kinds of magic. I have made a great purgation, and those in this house will sleep the better for it.\"7.      That Dr. Willetts \"purgation\" had been an ordeal almost as nerve-racking in its way as his hideous wandering in the vanished crypt is shewn by the fact that the elderly physician gave out completely as soon as he reached home that evening. For three days he rested constantly in his room, though servants later muttered something about having heard him after midnight on Wednesday, when the outer door softly opened and closed with phenomenal softness. Servants imaginations, fortunately, are limited, else comment might have been excited by an item in Thursdays Evening Bulletin which ran as follows:North End GhoulsActive AgainAfter a lull of ten months since the dastardly vandalism in the Weeden lot at the North Burial Ground, a nocturnal prowler was glimpsed early this morning in the same cemetery by Robert Hart, the night watchman. Happening to glance for a moment from his shelter at about 2 a.m., Hart observed the glow of a lantern or pocket torch not far to the northwest, and upon opening the door detected the figure of a man with a trowel very plainly silhouetted against a nearby electric light. At once starting in pursuit, he saw the figure dart hurriedly toward the main entrance, gaining the street and losing himself among the shadows before approach or capture was possible.      Like the first of the ghouls active during the past year, this intruder had done no real damage before detection. A vacant part of the Ward lot shewed signs of a little superficial digging, but nothing even nearly the size of a grave had been attempted, and no previous grave had been disturbed.      Hart, who cannot describe the prowler except as a small man probably having a full beard, inclines to the view that all three of the digging incidents have a common source; but police from the Second Station think otherwise on account of the savage nature of the second incident, where an ancient coffin was removed and its headstone violently shattered.      The first of the incidents, in which it is thought an attempt to bury something was frustrated, occurred a year ago last March, and has been attributed to bootleggers seeking a cache. It is possible, says Sergt. Riley, that this third affair is of similar nature. Officers at the Second Station are taking especial pains to capture the gang of miscreants responsible for these repeated outrages.      All day Thursday Dr. Willett rested as if recuperating from something past or nerving himself for something to come. In the evening he wrote a note to Mr. Ward, which was delivered the next morning and which caused the half-dazed parent to ponder long and deeply. Mr. Ward had not been able to go down to business since the shock of Monday with its baffling reports and its sinister \"purgation\", but he found something calming about the doctors letter in spite of the despair it seemed to promise and the fresh mysteries it seemed to evoke.\"10 Barnes St.,            Providence, R.I.,      April 12, 1928.\"Dear Theodore: - I feel that I must say a word to you before doing what I am going to do tomorrow. It will conclude the terrible business we have been going through (for I feel that no spade is ever likely to reach that monstrous place we know of), but Im afraid it wont set your mind at rest unless I expressly assure you how very conclusive it is.      \"You have known me ever since you were a small boy, so I think you will not distrust me when I hint that some matters are best left undecided and unexplored. It is better that you attempt no further speculation as to Charless case, and almost imperative that you tell his mother nothing more than she already suspects. When I call on you tomorrow Charles will have escaped. That is all which need remain in anyones mind. He was mad, and he escaped. You can tell his mother gently and gradually about the mad part when you stop sending the typed notes in his name. Id advise you to join her in Atlantic City and take a rest yourself. God knows you need one after this shock, as I do myself. I am going South for a while to calm down and brace up.      \"So dont ask me any questions when I call. It may be that something will go wrong, but Ill tell you if it does. I dont think it will. There will be nothing more to worry about, for Charles will be very, very safe. He is now - safer than you dream. You need hold no fears about Allen, and who or what he is. He forms as much a part of the past as Joseph Curwens picture, and when I ring your doorbell you may feel certain that there is no such person. And what wrote that minuscule message will never trouble you or yours.      \"But you must steel yourself to melancholy, and prepare your wife to do the same. I must tell you frankly that Charless escape will not mean his restoration to you. He has been afflicted with a peculiar disease, as you must realise from the subtle physical as well as mental changes in him, and you must not hope to see him again. Have only this consolation - that he was never a fiend or even truly a madman, but only an eager, studious, and curious boy whose love of mystery and of the past was his undoing. He stumbled on things no mortal ought ever to know, and reached back through the years as no one ever should reach; and something came out of those years to engulf him.      \"And now comes the matter in which I must ask you to trust me most of all. For there will be, indeed, no uncertainty about Charless fate. In about a year, say, you can if you wish devise a suitable account of the end; for the boy will be no more. You can put up a stone in your lot at the North Burial Ground exactly ten feet west of your fathers and facing the same way, and that will mark the true resting-place of your son. Nor need you fear that it will mark any abnormality or changeling. The ashes in that grave will be those of your own unaltered bone and sinew - of the real Charles Dexter Ward whose mind you watched from infancy - the real Charles with the olive-mark on his hip and without the black witch-mark on his chest or the pit on his forehead. The Charles who never did actual evil, and who will have paid with his life for his squeamishness.      \"That is all. Charles will have escaped, and a year from now you can put up his stone. Do not question me tomorrow. And believe that the honour of your ancient family remains untainted now, as it has been at all times in the past.      \"With profoundest sympathy, and exhortations to fortitude, calmness, and resignation, I am everSincerely your friend,      Marinus B. Willett\"      So on the morning of Friday, April 13, 1928, Marinus Bicknell Willett visited the room of Charles Dexter Ward at Dr. Waites private hospital on Conanicut Island. The youth, though making no attempt to evade his caller, was in a sullen mood; and seemed disinclined to open the conversation which Willett obviously desired. The doctors discovery of the crypt and his monstrous experience therein had of course created a new source of embarrassment, so that both hesitated perceptibly after the interchange of a few strained formalities. Then a new element of constraint crept in, as Ward seemed to read behind the doctors mask-like face a terrible purpose which had never been there before. The patient quailed, conscious that since the last visit there had been a change whereby the solicitous family physician had given place to the ruthless and implacable avenger.      Ward actually turned pale, and the doctor was the first to speak. \"More,\" he said, \"has been found out, and I must warn you fairly that a reckoning is due.\"      \"Digging again, and coming upon more poor starving pets?\" was the ironic reply. It was evident that the youth meant to shew bravado to the last.      \"No,\" Willett slowly rejoined, \"this time I did not have to dig. We have had men looking up Dr. Allen, and they found the false beard and spectacles in the bungalow.\"      \"Excellent,\" commented the disquieted host in an effort to be wittily insulting, \"and I trust they proved more becoming than the beard and glasses you now have on!\"      \"They would become you very well,\" came the even and studied response, \"as indeed they seem to have done.\"      As Willett said this, it almost seemed as though a cloud passed over the sun; though there was no change in the shadows on the floor. Then Ward ventured:      \"And is this what asks so hotly for a reckoning? Suppose a man does find it now and then useful to be twofold?\"      \"No,\" said Willett gravely, \"again you are wrong. It is no business of mine if any man seeks duality; provided he has any right to exist at all, and provided he does not destroy what called him out of space.\"      Ward now started violently. \"Well, Sir, what have ye found, and what dye want with me?\"      The doctor let a little time elapse before replying, as if choosing his words for an effective answer.      \"I have found,\" he finally intoned, \"something in a cupboard behind an ancient overmantel where a picture once was, and I have burned it and buried the ashes where the grave of Charles Dexter Ward ought to be.\"      The madman choked and sprang from the chair in which he had been sitting:      \"Damn ye, who did ye tell - and wholl believe it was he after these full two months, with me alive? What dye mean to do?\"      Willett, though a small man, actually took on a kind of judicial majesty as he calmed the patient with a gesture.      \"I have told no one. This is no common case - it is a madness out of time and a horror from beyond the spheres which no police or lawyers or courts or alienists could ever fathom or grapple with. Thank God some chance has left inside me the spark of imagination, that I might not go astray in thinking out this thing. You cannot deceive me, Joseph Curwen, for I know that your accursed magic is true!      \"I know how you wove the spell that brooded outside the years and fastened on your double and descendant; I know how you drew him into the past and got him to raise you up from your detestable grave; I know how he kept you hidden in his laboratory while you studied modern things and roved abroad as a vampire by night, and how you later shewed yourself in beard and glasses that no one might wonder at your godless likeness to him; I know what you resolved to do when he balked at your monstrous rifling of the worlds tombs, and at what you planned afterward, and I know how you did it.      \"You left off your beard and glasses and fooled the guards around the house. They thought it was he who went in, and they thought it was he who came out when you had strangled and hidden him. But you hadnt reckoned on the different contents of two minds. You were a fool, Curwen, to fancy that a mere visual identity would be enough. Why didnt you think of the speech and the voice and the handwriting? It hasnt worked, you see, after all. You know better than I who or what wrote that message in minuscules, but I will warn you it was not written in vain. There are abominations and blasphemies which must be stamped out, and I believe that the writer of those words will attend to Orne and Hutchinson. One of those creatures wrote you once, do not call up any that you can not put down. You were undone once before, perhaps in that very way, and it may be that your own evil magic will undo you all again. Curwen, a man cant tamper with Nature beyond certain limits, and every horror you have woven will rise up to wipe you out.\"      But here the doctor was cut short by a convulsive cry from the creature before him. Hopelessly at bay, weaponless, and knowing that any show of physical violence would bring a score of attendants to the doctors rescue, Joseph Curwen had recourse to his one ancient ally, and began a series of cabbalistic motions with his forefingers as his deep, hollow voice, now unconcealed by feigned hoarseness, bellowed out the opening words of a terrible formula.      \"PER ADONAI ELOIM, ADONAI JEHOVA, ADONAI SABAOTH, METRATON. . . .\"      But Willett was too quick for him. Even as the dogs in the yard outside began to howl, and even as a chill wind sprang suddenly up from the bay, the doctor commenced the solemn and measured intonation of that which he had meant all along to recite. An eye for an eye - magic for magic - let the outcome shew how well the lesson of the abyss had been learned! So in a clear voice Marinus Bicknell Willett began the second of that pair of formulae whose first had raised the writer of those minuscules - the cryptic invocation whose heading was the Dragons Tail, sign of the descending node - \"OGTHROD AIFGEBL - EEHYOG-SOTHOTHNGAHNG AIYZHRO!\"      At the very first word from Willetts mouth the previously commenced formula of the patient stopped short. Unable to speak, the monster made wild motions with his arms until they too were arrested. When the awful name of Yog-Sothoth was uttered, the hideous change began. It was not merely a dissolution, but rather a transformation or recapitulation; and Willett shut his eyes lest he faint before the rest of the incantation could be pronounced.      But he did not faint, and that man of unholy centuries and forbidden secrets never troubled the world again. The madness out of time had subsided, and the case of Charles Dexter Ward was closed. Opening his eyes before staggering out of that room of horror, Dr. Willett saw that what he had kept in memory had not been kept amiss. There had, as he had predicted, been no need for acids. For like his accursed picture a year before, Joseph Curwen now lay scattered on the floor as a thin coating of fine bluish-grey dust.", "IX.Friday morning Armitage, Rice, and Morgan set out by motor for Dunwich, arriving at the village about one in the afternoon. The day was pleasant, but even in the brightest sunlight a kind of quiet dread and portent seemed to hover about the strangely domed hills and the deep, shadowy ravines of the stricken region. Now and then on some mountain-top a gaunt circle of stones could be glimpsed against the sky. From the air of hushed fright at Osborn’s store they knew something hideous had happened, and soon learned of the annihilation of the Elmer Frye house and family. Throughout that afternoon they rode around Dunwich; questioning the natives concerning all that had occurred, and seeing for themselves with rising pangs of horror the drear Frye ruins with their lingering traces of the tarry stickiness, the blasphemous tracks in the Frye yard, the wounded Seth Bishop cattle, and the enormous swaths of disturbed vegetation in various places. The trail up and down Sentinel Hill seemed to Armitage of almost cataclysmic significance, and he looked long at the sinister altar-like stone on the summit.      At length the visitors, apprised of a party of State Police which had come from Aylesbury that morning in response to the first telephone reports of the Frye tragedy, decided to seek out the officers and compare notes as far as practicable. This, however, they found more easily planned than performed; since no sign of the party could be found in any direction. There had been five of them in a car, but now the car stood empty near the ruins in the Frye yard. The natives, all of whom had talked with the policemen, seemed at first as perplexed as Armitage and his companions. Then old Sam Hutchins thought of something and turned pale, nudging Fred Farr and pointing to the dank, deep hollow that yawned close by.      “Gawd,” he gasped, “I telled ’em not ter go daown into the glen, an’ I never thought nobody’d dew it with them tracks an’ that smell an’ the whippoorwills a-screechin’ daown thar in the dark o’ noonday. . . .”      A cold shudder ran through natives and visitors alike, and every ear seemed strained in a kind of instinctive, unconscious listening. Armitage, now that he had actually come upon the horror and its monstrous work, trembled with the responsibility he felt to be his. Night would soon fall, and it was then that the mountainous blasphemy lumbered upon its eldritch course. Negotium perambulans in tenebris. . . . The old librarian rehearsed the formulae he had memorised, and clutched the paper containing the alternative one he had not memorised. He saw that his electric flashlight was in working order. Rice, beside him, took from a valise a metal sprayer of the sort used in combating insects; whilst Morgan uncased the big-game rifle on which he relied despite his colleague’s warnings that no material weapon would be of help.      Armitage, having read the hideous diary, knew painfully well what kind of a manifestation to expect; but he did not add to the fright of the Dunwich people by giving any hints or clues. He hoped that it might be conquered without any revelation to the world of the monstrous thing it had escaped. As the shadows gathered, the natives commenced to disperse homeward, anxious to bar themselves indoors despite the present evidence that all human locks and bolts were useless before a force that could bend trees and crush houses when it chose. They shook their heads at the visitors’ plan to stand guard at the Frye ruins near the glen; and as they left, had little expectancy of ever seeing the watchers again.      There were rumblings under the hills that night, and the whippoorwills piped threateningly. Once in a while a wind, sweeping up out of Cold Spring Glen, would bring a touch of ineffable foetor to the heavy night air; such a foetor as all three of the watchers had smelled once before, when they stood above a dying thing that had passed for fifteen years and a half as a human being. But the looked-for terror did not appear. Whatever was down there in the glen was biding its time, and Armitage told his colleagues it would be suicidal to try to attack it in the dark.      Morning came wanly, and the night-sounds ceased. It was a grey, bleak day, with now and then a drizzle of rain; and heavier and heavier clouds seemed to be piling themselves up beyond the hills to the northwest. The men from Arkham were undecided what to do. Seeking shelter from the increasing rainfall beneath one of the few undestroyed Frye outbuildings, they debated the wisdom of waiting, or of taking the aggressive and going down into the glen in quest of their nameless, monstrous quarry. The downpour waxed in heaviness, and distant peals of thunder sounded from far horizons. Sheet lightning shimmered, and then a forky bolt flashed near at hand, as if descending into the accursed glen itself. The sky grew very dark, and the watchers hoped that the storm would prove a short, sharp one followed by clear weather.      It was still gruesomely dark when, not much over an hour later, a confused babel of voices sounded down the road. Another moment brought to view a frightened group of more than a dozen men, running, shouting, and even whimpering hysterically. Someone in the lead began sobbing out words, and the Arkham men started violently when those words developed a coherent form.      “Oh, my Gawd, my Gawd,” the voice choked out. “It’s a-goin’ agin, an’ this time by day! It’s aout—it’s aout an’ a-movin’ this very minute, an’ only the Lord knows when it’ll be on us all!”      The speaker panted into silence, but another took up his message.      “Nigh on a haour ago Zeb Whateley here heerd the ’phone a-ringin’, an’ it was Mis’ Corey, George’s wife, that lives daown by the junction. She says the hired boy Luther was aout drivin’ in the caows from the storm arter the big bolt, when he see all the trees a-bendin’ at the maouth o’ the glen—opposite side ter this—an’ smelt the same awful smell like he smelt when he faound the big tracks las’ Monday mornin’. An’ she says he says they was a swishin’, lappin’ saound, more nor what the bendin’ trees an’ bushes could make, an’ all on a suddent the trees along the rud begun ter git pushed one side, an’ they was a awful stompin’ an’ splashin’ in the mud. But mind ye, Luther he didn’t see nothin’ at all, only just the bendin’ trees an’ underbrush.      “Then fur ahead where Bishop’s Brook goes under the rud he heerd a awful creakin’ an’ strainin’ on the bridge, an’ says he could tell the saound o’ wood a-startin’ to crack an’ split. An’ all the whiles he never see a thing, only them trees an’ bushes a-bendin’. An’ when the swishin’ saound got very fur off—on the rud towards Wizard Whateley’s an’ Sentinel Hill—Luther he had the guts ter step up whar he’d heerd it furst an’ look at the graound. It was all mud an’ water, an’ the sky was dark, an’ the rain was wipin’ aout all tracks abaout as fast as could be; but beginnin’ at the glen maouth, whar the trees had moved, they was still some o’ them awful prints big as bar’ls like he seen Monday.”      At this point the first excited speaker interrupted.      “But that ain’t the trouble naow—that was only the start. Zeb here was callin’ folks up an’ everybody was a-listenin’ in when a call from Seth Bishop’s cut in. His haousekeeper Sally was carryin’ on fit ter kill—she’d jest seed the trees a-bendin’ beside the rud, an’ says they was a kind o’ mushy saound, like a elephant puffin’ an’ treadin’, a-headin’ fer the haouse. Then she up an’ spoke suddent of a fearful smell, an’ says her boy Cha’ncey was a-screamin’ as haow it was jest like what he smelt up to the Whateley rewins Monday mornin’. An’ the dogs was all barkin’ an’ whinin’ awful.      “An’ then she let aout a turrible yell, an’ says the shed daown the rud had jest caved in like the storm hed blowed it over, only the wind wa’n’t strong enough to dew that. Everybody was a-listenin’, an’ we could hear lots o’ folks on the wire a-gaspin’. All to onct Sally she yelled agin, an’ says the front yard picket fence hed just crumbled up, though they wa’n’t no sign o’ what done it. Then everybody on the line could hear Cha’ncey an’ ol’ Seth Bishop a-yellin’ tew, an’ Sally was shriekin’ aout that suthin’ heavy hed struck the haouse—not lightnin’ nor nothin’, but suthin’ heavy agin the front, that kep’ a-launchin’ itself agin an’ agin, though ye couldn’t see nothin’ aout the front winders. An’ then . . . an’ then . . .”      Lines of fright deepened on every face; and Armitage, shaken as he was, had barely poise enough to prompt the speaker.      “An’ then . . . Sally she yelled aout, ’O help, the haouse is a-cavin’ in’ . . . an’ on the wire we could hear a turrible crashin’, an’ a hull flock o’ screamin’ . . . jest like when Elmer Frye’s place was took, only wuss. . . .”      The man paused, and another of the crowd spoke.      “That’s all—not a saound nor squeak over the ’phone arter that. Jest still-like. We that heerd it got aout Fords an’ wagons an’ raounded up as many able-bodied menfolks as we could git, at Corey’s place, an’ come up here ter see what yew thought best ter dew. Not but what I think it’s the Lord’s jedgment fer our iniquities, that no mortal kin ever set aside.”      Armitage saw that the time for positive action had come, and spoke decisively to the faltering group of frightened rustics.      “We must follow it, boys.” He made his voice as reassuring as possible. “I believe there’s a chance of putting it out of business. You men know that those Whateleys were wizards—well, this thing is a thing of wizardry, and must be put down by the same means. I’ve seen Wilbur Whateley’s diary and read some of the strange old books he used to read; and I think I know the right kind of spell to recite to make the thing fade away. Of course, one can’t be sure, but we can always take a chance. It’s invisible—I knew it would be—but there’s a powder in this long-distance sprayer that might make it shew up for a second. Later on we’ll try it. It’s a frightful thing to have alive, but it isn’t as bad as what Wilbur would have let in if he’d lived longer. You’ll never know what the world has escaped. Now we’ve only this one thing to fight, and it can’t multiply. It can, though, do a lot of harm; so we mustn’t hesitate to rid the community of it.      “We must follow it—and the way to begin is to go to the place that has just been wrecked. Let somebody lead the way—I don’t know your roads very well, but I’ve an idea there might be a shorter cut across lots. How about it?”      The men shuffled about a moment, and then Earl Sawyer spoke softly, pointing with a grimy finger through the steadily lessening rain.      “I guess ye kin git to Seth Bishop’s quickest by cuttin’ acrost the lower medder here, wadin’ the brook at the low place, an’ climbin’ through Carrier’s mowin’ and the timber-lot beyont. That comes aout on the upper rud mighty nigh Seth’s—a leetle t’other side.”      Armitage, with Rice and Morgan, started to walk in the direction indicated; and most of the natives followed slowly. The sky was growing lighter, and there were signs that the storm had worn itself away. When Armitage inadvertently took a wrong direction, Joe Osborn warned him and walked ahead to shew the right one. Courage and confidence were mounting; though the twilight of the almost perpendicular wooded hill which lay toward the end of their short cut, and among whose fantastic ancient trees they had to scramble as if up a ladder, put these qualities to a severe test.      At length they emerged on a muddy road to find the sun coming out. They were a little beyond the Seth Bishop place, but bent trees and hideously unmistakable tracks shewed what had passed by. Only a few moments were consumed in surveying the ruins just around the bend. It was the Frye incident all over again, and nothing dead or living was found in either of the collapsed shells which had been the Bishop house and barn. No one cared to remain there amidst the stench and tarry stickiness, but all turned instinctively to the line of horrible prints leading on toward the wrecked Whateley farmhouse and the altar-crowned slopes of Sentinel Hill.      As the men passed the site of Wilbur Whateley’s abode they shuddered visibly, and seemed again to mix hesitancy with their zeal. It was no joke tracking down something as big as a house that one could not see, but that had all the vicious malevolence of a daemon. Opposite the base of Sentinel Hill the tracks left the road, and there was a fresh bending and matting visible along the broad swath marking the monster’s former route to and from the summit.      Armitage produced a pocket telescope of considerable power and scanned the steep green side of the hill. Then he handed the instrument to Morgan, whose sight was keener. After a moment of gazing Morgan cried out sharply, passing the glass to Earl Sawyer and indicating a certain spot on the slope with his finger. Sawyer, as clumsy as most non-users of optical devices are, fumbled a while; but eventually focussed the lenses with Armitage’s aid. When he did so his cry was less restrained than Morgan’s had been.      “Gawd almighty, the grass an’ bushes is a-movin’! It’s a-goin’ up—slow-like—creepin’ up ter the top this minute, heaven only knows what fur!”      Then the germ of panic seemed to spread among the seekers. It was one thing to chase the nameless entity, but quite another to find it. Spells might be all right—but suppose they weren’t? Voices began questioning Armitage about what he knew of the thing, and no reply seemed quite to satisfy. Everyone seemed to feel himself in close proximity to phases of Nature and of being utterly forbidden, and wholly outside the sane experience of mankind."]}
{"id": "EN007", "pair": ["Hanoi, Socialist Republic of VietnamJune 24, 2011.\"Hey, were here. Get up if you dont want to wake up in Hue!\"Joseph Clayton was shaken awake by the hand of one of his classmates on his shoulder. He was sitting in the back of a taxi van... the only one left sitting, actually, as the others had already disembarked to enter the government office they were parked in front of.Which probably meant that he was left to pay the fare.After he payed (as seemed to be his lot on this trip), he followed his classmates and his professor into the government office where they hoped to finally receive their travel permits. He hadnt gotten much of sleep on the plane; a mixture of excitement in the face of overseas travel and sheer jet-lag had conspired to leave him weary and light headed until he got a few hours sleep, which the taxi ride had partially afforded him.And in that sleep...The dream had come as a stark, clear memory. When Marie had said that she wasnt going to join him at the Miskatonic campus in Arkham for what would be their first year of university, he had been devastated. His first questions, rushed and frantic, had been about the cause of such a change. She certainly had the SAT score to qualify and student debt could be handled with relative ease. Had she decided to forgo post-secondary to concentrate on her stake in the restaurant? Had financial problems struck and prevented admissions from being paid?Was it something about him?Her answers, far more controlled than his frenzied speculation, had all been in the negative. Her SAT scores were good, student loans were still open and she still intended to go for a degree in Biology at Miskatonic. It was just... after shed gotten that phonograph from her parents home village, the repayment had been a promise to come and spend a year back in the \"Old Country\" as soon as she could. It would only be for a year and then she would return, ready for university and all accompaniments.That had been very nearly one year before. She had promised him that she would be coming back in the summer of 2011... but after she had arrived in Vietnam, all contact had stopped cold. Her parents, when asked about her condition, always responded with affirmations that she would return and that she was fine... but as winter wore onto spring, subtle hints of doubt and worry had crept into their voices. Had they even been receiving any news from their daughter and if not, then why not? Had something gone terribly wrong?As it happened, more baffling events awaited inside.\"What do you mean, restricted?\" Joseph asked the Communist Party bureaucrat sitting across the desk from him. Of course, due to the facts that first, said bureaucrat was a government employee and second, they were not alone in the room, Joseph had been careful not to sound too brunt in his tone. A trung sior Sergeant, wearing the forest green uniform of the Vietnam Border Defence Force (VPA), stood by the door of the office, both watching and guarding.Relieved at being able to shed his stilted English after Joseph exhibited a decent grasp of the Vietnamese language, the bureaucrat put forth what he knew of the situation. \"Civilian access is almost completely denied inside the area you requested. To be honest, that section of the border has been troublesome ever since the war. We get reports of smugglers, poachers, bandits, Hmong insurgents... every type of violent counter-revolutionary you can think of, this region seems to have it. The local Bru farmers arent much help, but they generally dont bother others and seem to accept the military presence we keep there.\" The bureaucrat shifted his gaze from Joseph to Professor Neville Andover, the leader of this particular expedition. \"Im sorry, but theres nothing that can be done without high level authorization.\"As a response to this, Neville Andover did not get upset. He did not resign himself to failure. He did not even try to ask if there was any other avenue of entry or way to access the information he needed. He just donned an odd, amused smile, the corners of his eyes crinkling behind his wire rim glasses. \"I assume that General Vo is still the Secretary for the Border Forces?\" He asked, almost distractedly. When the official answered yes, Professor Andover reached into the inside of his light cotton jacket and pulled out a small, metal case. From this case, he removed a single paper card of purest black, embossed with an emerald green \"Delta\" symbol and a capital \"Y\" of gold in the center of that hollow triangle. \"I have been in contact with Comrade Vo for the last six months, planning this expedition as an act of cooperation between our two governments and as a boon for my University. He knows that card; show it or describe it to him... you maywant to run it by General Tran as well. Either way, they will give you the answer you need.\"As the bureaucrat took the card and then as the Border Defense sergeant took it from him and headed out of the room, Joesph wondered about his professor and the oddities that surrounded him. The first time he had ever seen the Professor, it had been in his High School Auditorium as Marie had performed the Stork Dance... and Joseph had noticed strange things. In their senior year of High School, both he and Marie had received reference letters to Miskatonic University in Arkham, a town in Essex county. When he had arrived at Miskatonic (without Marie), he had been shocked that the professor for his Cultural Anthropology class was not only the one who had given him his reference but was also the man who had he had seen three years before.And then there were his classmates, three of whom had also come on this expedition. Many of them had received similar letters from Prof. Andover and most of those, though not relaying specifics, had said that they had found the circumstances equally strange. Two who had gotten references were on this very trip with them. The first was Tracy Williams from the farm country of Northwest Virginia, a girl with blond hair quite a few shades lighter than Josephs own brassy brown and the class Nippon-Nut, being both obsessed with Anime and Manga as well as being Japanese-proficient. The second was Albert Noyes, a young man who has part white, part black and a little Algonquin-Indian from a small hamlet in southern Vermont. His specialties were technology, math and Mandarin Chinese. The third member of retinue was a young man named Malone who... frankly, was a mystery to the entire class. However, he had volunteered for this trip and his grades had been excellent so his place on the roster had been assured.But there was still a nagging question at the back of his mind: why? Why had they received offers to go to an obscure if admittedly exceptional regional university when the big names had all passed them over? Why had they been gathered from all across the United States by a single professor? And why, it seemed, did it feel like there was such a big connection between the missing member of Dr. Andovers \"collection\" and the reason behind this expedition?Why did it feel as if Marie was somehow connected to this?Eventually, the sergeant came back and informed the bureaucrat of General Vos express permission for the Professor and his students to enter the exclusion zone as well as General Trans confirmation, before handing the card back to Neville Andover. Joseph knew that academics could sometimes have friends in high and unusual places, but counting on ... no, expecting the approval of not just one, but two ranking Generals in a non-allied nation? This seemed crazy, certifiably insane even.But then, so did spectral storks and spoonbills.Northernmost Quang Binh Province, Socialist Republic of VietnamJune 29, 2011Despite the calm look on the professors face, something about the current situation made Joseph Clayton distinctly ill at ease.They had spent the last two days trudging up into the Annamite mountains after leaving the fertile coastal plain. At the last village with road access, they had ditched their vehicles and backpacked up the ridges and trails, counting on a guide from the local Bru people to lead them to... whatever Prof. Andover was looking for. The fact that the guide was now legging it quite quickly back down the misty path told Joseph that something had either gone incredibly wrong or incredibly right.Now, Neville Andover was chanting, seemingly trying to communicate with something deep in the thick underbrush on either side of the worn, overgrown gully that had been called a trail. The language was almost intellig ible to Joseph, being a form of Mon-Khmer linked to the classical Vietnamese he had studied, perhaps with a few hints of Muong intermixed. However, the syntax and grammer were archaic to say the least. From some of the words used it even seemed to be achingly familiar, almost as if...With a sudden realization of shock and the smell of grilled pork and Bac Bon Dzhow a memory in his nostrils, Joseph realized where he had encountered this form of Vietic before.But the shocks were not over.Spun around by Albert Noyes to see something, Joseph gazed upward to see a human figure standing upon the high bank, glancing down at them with hard, measuring eyes. Undoubtedly masculine, the figure was of a man of slightly darker skin than the farmers of the coast (though the features were similar) and of greater height than either them or the native Bru. Clothed only in a white cotton kilt with geometric designs in black and a leather girdle, this man carried a white flatbow decorated with bands of green, blue and red while a bronze dagger rested at his hip. His head was shaved of all hair, and black designs were tattooed from the crown of the scalp to the jawline, with more tattoos covering his arms, chest and lower legs.The fact that an arrow was nocked in the string of his bow put the four young people on edge, with Malone and Joesph himself tightening the grips on the hilts of their machetes in anticipation of a hopeless fight. More men in similar dress and tattoos, some with bronze slashing swords, some with bronze-headed spears and others with flatbows, appeared out of the forest on either side of them. Now that Joseph could get a better look at them in the dim light filtering down through the forest canopy and the mist, their arm tattoos began looking very similar to those borne by Maries parents while those on their faces, while different in design, were still similar in form.All the while, Prof. Andover kept up the low chanting, of which Joseph could pick out individual words: \"friend\", \"gods\", \"village\", \"priest\", \"comrade\" and at least one invocation of Ho Chi Minh among them. To this, these strange men seemed to confer with each other though glances and nods before took one took a short, bamboo tube from his girdle, put one end to his mouth, took a deep breath and blew.As the silvery-blue powder erupted from the tube, settled on the heads of the trekking academics and they each lost consciousness in turn, Joseph wondered if this could get any worse.Meanwhile, Spoonbill VillageTsan Pho Dao had been the Chief Priest of this village for many years, ever since the death of his father in the closing days of the American War. In that span of years, he had seen many futures and advised his people based on those futures. He had called down both ruin and plenty by invoking the power of the gods of his people. He alone, in a feat outside even the power of the hereditary village chiefs, had communicated with the Instrument of their gods, a being possessed of both boundless knowledge and an absolutely rotten temper. He also, most importantly, had an absolutely perfect memory of his entire life... and that of his father, and his father before him.To be perfectly honest, he held a tremendous amount of power within this village. The ancestor shrines belonged to families while the hunters had their own little shrines up the mountain where midnight rituals were performed to gather poison for the tips of arrows and darts. But those rituals needed to be performed by the minor priests under his command. This temple was the spiritual center of his people for most of the year and the temple with its darkened wood walls lit only by feeble braziers whose light was twisted by the smoke of rare and powerful incenses, with its figurines of gods and demons carved from nephrite and jadeite brought from deep below the earth... was his domain. His and no one else. He divined the future when possible, he performed the rites and as a result, it was he who had taken countless lives in sacrifice over the course of his adulthood: chickens, pigs, goats, buffalo... people.As he sat at a low table in his private sanctuary, trying to divine some course for a question that had faced him for most of a year, he noticed something. One of the golden discs he used for divination, a coin looted from a Chinese caravan many centuries ago, stood up on its rim and began to roll. Following the curve of failing momentum, the coin finally came to rest at a specific point on the table, a place that held indication of the future.Visitors... and not the \"ketchup\" kind of visitors.Several Hours Later, Close to the Laos BorderThe answer to Joseph Claytons earlier question was a definite yes. When he had awoken, he had found his wrists and ankles bound, the bindings looped over a pole carried by two men with him and the other students suspended like deer carcasses. The Professor, on the other hand, had not been bound, but had found transport by sitting in a large basket suspended from one of the poles by a cord, carried by a pair of men. They had been going downhill from the crest of a ridge and were now leaving the forest, coming onto a road. First, they passed under a wooden gate where roosting spoonbills had been carved into the posts and a sun flanked by two dragons had been carved into the beams above the road.Then Joseph saw where they were headed. A village of perhaps thirty houses was visible in the valley bottom while narrow terraces had been cut into the hills above, green with growing rice. The view quickly vanished as the men began heading into the village itself but sight was soon replaced with sound. The quiet of the forest was supplanted by the cacophony of a hundred sounds: chickens and pigs grunted and clucked as the animals rooted below the houses and around the garbage heaps while odd-looking reddish dogs, lazing in the sun on the porches of the outermost houses, whined in surprise at the new arrivals. The sounds of tools and primitive machinery clunked melodiously. The sounds of people also were audible: talking, laughing, shouting and even a few low notes of womens work songs were possible for Joseph to pick out of the general buzz... a buzz which also included Albert trying to reason with their captors and Tracy displaying an unusually foul mouth toward same.Soon, people began to notice the men bringing in captives and a few even began to gather along the path as they entered the village, joining their dogs (or Dholes, as they were now identifiable as) who had come to sniff. It was mostly men, older boys and children who came out to watch while the women and the elderly usually went no further than windows and the porches of the stilt-houses that lined the road. Here, even hanging upside down, Joseph could notice a few things about the dress and appearance of the peopleFrankly... it was a bit odd.From what he knew, the Vietnamese national costume (in its modern form) placed a heavy emphasis on trousers, an item of clothing that he noticed was rather conspicuously absent here. Everyone here seemed to be wearing variations on one basic outfit in either brown or black: knee-length cotton kilts, short-sleeved cotton jackets (mostly with their front fastenings closed) and either rough-woven conical hats or simple cloths tied over their heads. The mens hair appeared to be cut short to the point where one could vaguely make out the tattoos on their scalp while children varied between the same shortness for boys and a single, long braid for the girls.Eventually they arrived in a great or square before what appeared to be the temple: a ponderous structure of wood and brick perched upon massive stone foundations, its sloping roofs flaring outward as if to shroud the surrounding houses from the scrutiny of the heavens. Around them, a crowd had gathered on all sides, an air of excitement buzzing in the air. Men exited the house across the square from the temple entrance and despite the calm demeanour of Professor Andover, words began filtering through to Joseph that began sounding more and more disturbing; words like \"kill\", \"sacrifice\" and \"ritual\". But another word came, one that sent darker imaginings and images rambling through his sensation-saturated mind.The word \"eat\".\"WAIT! STOP!\"Joseph knew those words as well... as well as that voice!Out of the crowd rushed a figure dressed much like the others: brown kilt and jacket, the latter partially open to reveal a yem undergarment and with a straw hat on her head. As Joseph finally began taking in other details, he noticed the tattooed lines and whimsical designs on her lower legs and arms and on her face, lines and vaguely triangular patterns that almost resembled the features of an orangutan.Her face... behind all the tattooing, the face of this woman was still as unmistakable to Joseph as the first day they had met in Kindergarten. To this sudden recognition, the young man could only exclaim his surprise as a soothingly familiar name.\"Marie?\"", "The Judas Mark\"Cthulhu ftaghn,\" He said with a laugh, swaying his tilted head to the right in a drunken manner. \"Cthulhu ftaghn.\"He broke out into a laughing fit. Then as quickly as it started it stopped; like the lightning bolt outside his window. Arkham was his place of work. And as a patient, his work was hard to complete. Not like he wanted to do it, either.The rain stopped.\"I hear youuuuuuu.\" He chuckled. \"I hear you flapping those blasted wings outside my windah.\" He giggled, then sobered up. \"Damn Migo. YA CANT HAVE MY BRAIN!\"There came a drum of plastic on metal as his attention was drawn to the orderly with a plastic flashlight. Aforementioned light shining into his padded room.\"Keep it down in there!\" The orderly snapped before leaving him alone once again.\"Power outage, eh?\" He chuckled. \"Wonder whyyyy.\"He rolled his head back to his right; towards his window. His eyes registered the sound of unearthly wings twitching like insects contemplating flight. Oh how he hated those damn things. Far worse than those Shoggoths he faced a while back. At least the Shoggoths ate you; thus ending your torment. But a Migo…He shuttered. He did not want to think about it.\"Nyarlahotep…You son of a bitch.\" He said, looking grumpy, then broke out in hysterics, then going back as if it never happened. \"If it werent for you…Id be…Id be…\"Where would he be? In his mind, he saw himself in Miami, laying on the beach with Lucinda, their two kids playing in the sand as the waves crashed soothingly onto the shore. But then his logic would kick that to the curb. Lucinda was showing signs…She would have dumped him if it werent for that Deep One, that is, dragging her-kicking and screaming-to the bottom of the sea.He would be away from his insane parents. That insane town of Dunwich. Even if Lucinda did not accompany him, he would, at least, be free from here. But then he met him.\"Jesus…\"\"Yes?\" Came a sweet, velvety voice. A voice one would hear from royalty.\"Not you.\" He snapped.\"But I am him.\" A hand placed itself on his shoulder as the entire figure appeared, sitting beside him like they were best friends.\"No...Youre the fucking antichrist.\"\"Is there really a difference in that either?\" Jesus asked, a smirk gracing his regal, black lips. \"Both promise paradise. From there, its on a persons opinion on what that is.\" He chuckled. \"And do not tell me that you forgot your title, Ivan…Or should I say Judas?\"\"THEN WHY PLACE ME HERE?\" Ivan shouted.\"Hey!\" The orderly shouted, banging his flashlight on the bars again. \"What did I just say?\"The orderlys face began to bubble. His flesh boiled, broken screams erupted from his face. He collapsed and scratched at his face, letting more and more blood poor onto the floor.\"I hate interruptions.\" Jesus said. \"And as for your answer…Because. If Jesus was as all powerful as he claimed, why did he allow Judas to stay in the fold? Why did he allow the lowly wretches hope? Why did I command Tython to drag Lucinda down to the depths to suffer being rendered by hungry maws before she could drown?\"He smirked evilly as he described Lucindas gruesome demise. Ivan panted heavily, his rage rising faster than Rlyeh ever would to the surface. Ivan struck thin air as his body moved too slow for the deity; whom was already standing, laughing at the mortal.\"Because theres more to it, Judas.\" Jesus said. \"Judas of old was an important player in the world. The wretches were a growing populace, if they loved him, they would worship him.\"\"Bullshit!\" He spat.\"Is it?\"\"We want you to betray us, Judas.\" Jesus said after his question was ignored.\"Why?\"\"Sorry, but us Christs keep some secrets from their disciples.\"\"What makes you Jesus?\"\"Our roles.\" He stated simply. \"You see…He was supposed to preach about us. But, sadly, his mind couldnt take it. So Cthulhu became a god. Not like it matters, religion changes all the time.\"He smirked, all knowing. \"And no, he wasnt the son of Cthulhu. That was my little trick.\"\"Pray Judas,\" He said from behind Ivan-not allowing him to speak-his black, decaying lips mere inches from his ear. \"He likes that. It makes him feel powerful.\"\"No,\" Ivan said. \"I shall not ya damned bastard! And I wont bring about their reawakening! These crazies will remain sedated!\"Jesus laughed.\"Thats my cue.\"Jesus grabbed Ivan by the neck and slammed his body against the wall. Buzzing from outside the window grew from a silent drone into a frenzy. Jesus smirked evilly, drawing his face closer to his Judas.\"In blood the mark is drawn.\"Nyarlahotep drew the blade he was hiding and slashed Ivans wrist, splattering drops of blood on the wall. He watched in delight as the drops spread, several linking up and continuing their intricate design.It consisted of a crude circle with intertwining tentacles and a pair of piercing eyes.\"There,\" He said. \"Done.\"He tossed Ivan. He landed next to the window and as he peered out of it he clearly saw the glowing heads and beating wings of the Migo, their forms slightly covered by the rain that began to fall again.\"Enjoy your trip, Judas.\" Nyarlahotep said. \"For though I am done with you, you still serve a purpose.\"The Migo swarmed, the window shattering like paper. Ivan barely had time to scream as they worked on his skull, amputating his brain and placing it inside their jar.\"Cthulhu ftagn, indeed.\""]}
{"id": "EN012", "pair": ["Spoonbill Village, Northernmost Quang Binh Province, SRV.June 30, 2011.Considering their first encounter, this meeting was going rather well.\"No, no, I assure you that I have had quite enough… well, if you insist…\" In the course of explaining his task to the household he would be staying in, Joseph Clayton had been offered tea at the behest of the mistress of the household and all three times, he had acquiesced. She was attending her husband in fine cotton clothes of white and black, the cut more resembling something out of Javanese dancing than anything worn in Indochina during the past thousand years. Their son, called from his lessons for the presentation, was sitting at the far end of the room, listening to what was going on. While he had repeated much the same spiel that Professor Andover to the houses three inhabitants, he had sipped at his bowl almost automatically as one would with water, clear onto what was now his fourth helping. Although not unpleasant, the drink had considerably more kick to it than even the strong brews typical of Vietnamese green tea.What perplexed Joseph was that he couldnt identify the extra ingredient. It wasnt peppers, having no discernible remains or even the raw chemical heat of capsaicin. It could be ginger, but the heat was of an utterly different kind than any ginger he had ever experienced.Then again, the additive could just as well be Tarantula venom given the figure he was giving his introduction to.His name, as he had given it, was Noc. He was the most experience hunter, archer and scout of the village, was of an incredibly ancient lineage and, incidentally, was the first person of this strange, isolated village that he had seen. His tattoos all featured arachnid themes of legs, webbing and fangs and his eyes…Marie had mentioned that some of the warriors practiced sorcery with mutative effects. If that was what caused Nocs eyes to become all black, seemingly all pupils and tempting Joseph to mentally refer to the man as \"Spider Eye\", then maybe those three weirdoes they caught in the biology labs back in February were onto something after all.Sitting in the main reception area of the home, replete with decorations of strange latticed designs and black lacquer, Joseph watched carefully as Noc finished examining one of his bowstrings before his eyes darted around the room. On the wall, several bows hung in their unstrung state: the white and banded flatbow he had first witnessed, several simple bows of light colored cane and even one recurve bow made of dark red hardwood.\"So that is your request: to hear the stories of our history, to observe the operation of a household of status and to… take part in our activities?\" Throughout the introduction of this man and the repetition he had given of the Professors offer, Noc had examined all aspects of him closely… and had not been impressed. He had some muscle tone, but everything else about him absolutely screamed that he was some sort of priest or urban scribe in training. Besides, the combination of the girls cues toward him and his reaction to his tea made it clear: if the boy had been a virgin, steam would have been pouring out of his ears. That made things difficult (and potentially dangerous) for everyone.Besides, very few people in this village held any affection at all for someone with Josephs skin tone.After receiving affirmation of Josephs duties, Noc laid out the rules. \"Know this: you will record the histories when they are told to you. You shall ask questions when you are allowed and you shall observe what you shall participate in what you are allowed to participate in. No pestering me with questions, no sneaking around trying to observe the women and children and no and I mean no trying to wheedle out information through trickery. We had quite enough trouble with that sort of thing the last time around.\"Joseph was immediately insulted, even though he did not how it as he automatically agreed. Still, two things bothered him. First, underneath the gold and bronze bangles that decorated the forearms and ankles of Nocs wife, Joseph had noticed strange scars, akin in shape to the marks that sperm whales bore from their battles with giant squid.Second… what did Noc mean by the last time around?That Night…As he lay awake, Joseph realized how exhausting the day had been. As it turned out, he was probably doing to spend most of his time in this house as a sort of a servant: documenting and participating in cooking and chores, handling domestic duties and picking little things up only as Nocs wife deemed appropriate. No real questions answered, no interesting discoveries or scandals or surprises… just ordinary ethnographic work.It wasnt made any better that his libido was getting annoyed at the busy signals it kept receiving. However, there had been no real opportunity to talk with Marie after last night, with all the revelations of cannibalism and sorcery and other things that probably should have made his stomach turn./Maybe it would be better if they had made your stomach turn./ Came a wheedling little multi-voiced dialogue from inside his head… from inside his head, but not originating from him.Oh no. Joseph thought with a mental groan. Not you idiots again! I thought you gave it up after the last time./The last time? You mean when you were in the thrall of carnal lusts, disgracing your heritage?/ The dominant voice changed from one of the old WASP lords to that of an aristocratic dowager that had been ancient even when Granny Clara had been a girl. /Maybe now that you know what her kind get up to, you will listen to reason and find a girl more suitable to a young man of your station./Her parents are just as middle class as mine are, thank you all very much. Joseph snarked back mentally, fully knowing how these… wraiths felt about his relationship with Marie and savoring the thought of causing them anguish./You know full well what is meant. What is not understood is why the other girl did not so arouse your… passions./Oh please, her family is just as drenched in sorcery as these guys, its just that theyre more polite about who they slice open. Besides, I dont really think youd have acted any differently if it had been Tracy Id been with that night instead of Marie, inbred and rural as she apparently is. He remembered clearly that night: how these voices (who he was fairly sure were not the products of schizophrenia despite superficially similar symptomatology), had come to him in the midst of what should have been unimaginable passion and communion with his girlfriend (though with was much more awkward, rushed and possibly painful than desired). Even as the passion mounted, their insults became worse: the taunts, the archaic, hateful rhetoric, the most vicious slurs directed against Marie and him. And yet he had forged on, continuing despite the rising chorus of insane voices inside his head… or even because of them, for as they blasphemed against all that Marie was, all the little things that made Joseph love her all the more, he could tell that his defiance was causing them actual pain and torment… and even through the pleasures of the flesh, he took small, sadistic delights in causing pain and anguish to these assholes who claimed authority as his forbearers.Now Joseph was getting annoyed… and cranky. Look, I dont have to listen to you idiots, even if you do claim to be my ancestors. You came from a completely different world whose rules do not apply to me. Also, the instruments of your authority are gone: no money, no status, no companies or contacts or friends in high places. All thats left are a bunch of ugly little voices in the wind. Why dont you all just blow away? He was tired of his, of having to listen to these inane snobs that he had learned to loath in the abstract and now hated in the concrete. He hated their hate-filled dismissals of all other peoples and cultures, their smug superiority and the generalized arrogance that seemed to drip from the voices.When they didnt respond, Joseph took it as a sign. \"Good.\" He said aloud, as softly as his sense of satisfaction allowed.", "May 19th, 1929,Miskatonic University, Arkham, Mass.In all honesty, the manner which Robert Olmstead exited the Chancellors office was not the most graceful to be seen in the history of Miskatonic University. However, perhaps \"exited\" is too neutral a term for a man being forcibly escorted out the double doors by two University proctors with a firm grasp on his forearms. \"Ejected\" is probably a good description though \"assaulted\" would have a good chance of being upheld by a court. As Mr. Olmstead was finally shoved out into the hall, he finally lost his balance and fell to his knees, the voluminous robes which he had worn since his arrival seeming to weigh him down.As Hiriam Willows and Brian Fife rushed out of the office and hastened to Roberts side, the man himself seemed... tired, drained of energy and showing signs of a fatigue that had been present since the meeting had began. Still, Mr. Olmstead managed to raise his head to address Chancellor Douglas Gooding, who was still in his office. \"I take it... negotiations have ended.\" Robert said this in as controlled a way as possible, trying to ignore the irritation at the back of his throat and the sides of his neck.\"Negotiations, as you call them, never began.\" Chancellor Gooding, a patrician of a man at the age of 57, had risen from behind his desk and was now walking toward the spot where Mr. Olmstead has stood and presented his case. \"This College has been handed a chance to claim credit for discovering the root devices behind most, if not all, of vertebrate biology and promises to make careers for many of our staff and students. Unless the Navy, who has graciously allowed access to its prisoners for this purpose, decides to either withdraw that access or, as you suggest, release them back into the general population, I see no reason why they should not remain under our supervision in their current quarters.\" Gooding eyes fell upon the floor where Robert had stood... and the staff that now lay on the floor. It was a strange thing: the matter itself almost resembled gray, petrified wood but in places its form showed characteristics of crustacean carapace or of the strange shapes present in fishbone or shark-jaw and, when the light hit it just so, the surface displayed a luster more akin to Nautilus shell or Mother of Pearl than any of those things.Gooding, in a sudden fit of antiquarian fascination, began kneeling down to take the strange rod. \"However, if you could tell us about this staff...\" Just as his the tips of his fingers brushed against the smooth surface the staff, seemingly under its own power, jerked butt-first towards the door, skidding over the floors polished hardwood planks. When it reached Robert. who was now being helped to his feet by Professor Fife, the staff actually began tipping up on its butt, the shaft guiding itself into Roberts limp, open hand.Grasping the staff to regain his posture, Robert glanced once more at Gooding. \"The staff is a secret that keeps itself. As to my plea... if that is your decision, I pray that you do not live to reap the whirlwind.\"\"Is that a threat?\" Chancellor Gooding was losing patience rapidly after this manifestation of the strange had made an intrusion into his office and annoyance was threatening to turn to anger.\"Merely a warning, good Chancellor.\" These were the last words that Robert Olmstead spoke to Gooding as Fife, carrying the papers that Olmstead had presented, helped him as he unsteadily walked down the hallway, supported by his implement.Just as Hiriam Willows was about to follow the pair, Gooding called to him. \"Hiriam! Get back in this office!\" Willows, his eyes continuing to follow his two companions down the hall for a moment, turned and walked back into the Chancellors office with a tightening of the lips and the speed of a slow stroll, more amenable to his aging legs than the fast walk he had so recently exerted himself with. \"Im surprised, Douglas.\"\"Surprised that I called you back in here?\" Asked Gooding as he sat back down behind his desk.\"That we are apparently operating on a first name basis now. As I recall, that has not been our habit since nineteen hundred and... seven, was it?\" It may have been facetious (to say the least) in bringing this up but after today, last winter and, to be honest, most days since Gooding had restricted Willows to a single morning class per week, he and the Chancellor has not quite been on the best of terms.\"Ah yes, the Cuba business. However... actually, that ispart of why I called you in here.\" Gooding pointed an almost accusatory finger at the older man. \"As I recall, youwere the one to countermand my decision to use force against those two Voodoo cults in Las Tunas.\"\"First of all, they were Santeria practitioners. Second, I was able to forge an armistice between the two warring factions and convince them to give up their murderous ways...\"\"In favor of continued use of animal sacrifice, I remember, I remember.\" Gooding put that accusatory finger to his temple as if to calm a throbbing. Then that finger returned to the standing faculty member. \"But whether youre French or Spanish does not mean much of anything when youre trying to rip open a portal to the tenth dimension, summoning dangerous ichors and vapors from beyond and, may I remind you, trying to violently murderas many people as needed for their insane goals. Hiriam... I know that youre a Quaker, I knowthat negotiating between groups of violent, degenerate heathens has always been your strong point, but this is something radicallydifferent.\"The Chancellor noticed Willows disbelieving roll of the eyes but continued. \"These... things have been present in and off the coast of Essex Country for the better part of a century. Theyve killed people, they subverted local government, through their negligence the port of Innsmouth nearly crumbled due to neglect... not to mention that theyve potentially forced themselves on local residents due to the existence of apparently hybrid individuals!\" He motioned out the door and pointed in the direction that Olmstead and Fife had exited. \"Did you happen to take a good look at the person who was just ejected from this office? My God Hiriam, the man was practically turning into a herring before our very eyes!\" Gooding seemed to calm down a bit. \"I know you were always one to try to see both sides of the argument, to resolve conflicts through calm deliberation... but this wasntnegotiation. This was a demand backed by veiled threats. I remember you being much sterner in the face of demands than this.\" There was a thoughtful pause. \"What happened in Virginia, Hiriam? Ever since you got back, youve been at your usual quest for cooperation between man and eldritch forces except... moreso.\"A hundred images flashed in Willows mind of that December in the Luray Valley. The little clusters of field-stone houses and barns around the southern tip of Mt. Ida; the lean-faced Quaker farm-folk; the walk through the community cemetery and the graves of his mothers family, the Caulfields. The children, so desperate to experience a properly Victorian Christmas in pageantry unknown by the community, inviting him to a snowball fight and following his lead in decorating and games (which he had found invigorating at the time). The experience of being around others of his faith for the first time in decades.But there was also the first time he had ever been forced to kill, as a .45 caliber ACP round hit dead center on his war-painted assailant in the mountain forests. The moment when he had discovered the small shrine beneath the Longhouse Meeting Hall with its black deer hides, Eastern Elk antlers and strange mix of artifacts. The sight of his hosts sacrificing pigs, wailing and dancing in the manner of the Seneca Iroquois at an isolated stone circle south along the mountains from the Armys battle with their foes, mourning for all the dead who would be brought out. And two of the bodies brought back, an apparent pair of adult twin sisters in matching warpaint who had charged the federal troops with knives before being mowed down: their hands had been intertwined even as fire from Thompson submachineguns had demolished their ribcages, the agony of their situation apparent from their found journals... the swelling around their eyes under the paint indicative of weeping.Hiriam shrugged as if he experienced nothing. \"Just a bit of reconnection with my mothers side of the family. Now, if you will excuse me?\" Before Gooding could even respond, Hiriam Willows walked out of the office and closed the doors behind him, exhaling in relief before he continued on to Professor Fifes office.Shortly, Professor Fifes OfficeBrian Fife sighed in frustration and concern as he dabbed the side of Robert Olmsteads neck with a handkerchief soaked in ice water. \"When was the last time you bothered to moisten the reservoir layers in this cloak? Any longer without adequate water around the gills and you would have been coughing up blood.\"Robert, sitting in a chair across from Fife, was now much less weary now that relief was being applied. \" There was no time. I had to act quickly to try to get them released and the last two days have been a flurry.\"\"Well, its just as well that I keep ice and water in my study or you would have...\" Fife was interrupted by Hiriam Willows entry into the office who, upon entering, simply asked himself how a militant like Douglas Gooding had become chancellor. Fifes answer to this question was concise. \"Well, Masterson died of Diphtheria while in Shanghai, Harvey has his Cocaine habit, Peaslee isnt totally trusted after that Yith business and yourefused to take any oath of office acceptable to the Congregationalist clergy. Gooding was the only member of the senior faculty with the necessary respectability left.\" \"Thank you very much. Now, what do we do next?\" Hiriam sat down in another chair, forming a semicircular huddle as he addressed Olmstead. \"Gooding isnt going to budge an inch without a proper prodding, the Arkham Police are beginning to take note of your lodgings at the Miskatonic Hotel and your current appearance which, may I remark, is becoming more piscine by the day, will not inspire confidence in the other involved parties.\"\"Then we have to properly prod. I have to prod. I owe that much at least.\" Robert, now that his neck and gills were properly wetted (and the kelp layers under his robe properly inundated with cold water), became quiet, both hands still across his lap, grasping the staff he had carried since he had arrived.Fife knew what he was thinking, for it was also close to his heart. \"Robert, you dont have to do this. The Priests of Yha-Nthlei wont judge you harshly if you dont bring home any more of our people than your cousin; I know its tragic, but its happened before that people have been lost to the surface world.\"Robert suddenly got a hard look in his eyes and stared directly at the other man. \"Do you know what it feels like to lose your parents, your child, your neighbors or friends? To not know where they were taken? To fear for their lives while they might be undergoing hideous, nefarious tortures? And then, one day, you are suddenly confronted with the grinning idiot who, in his disgust and primordial fear, ensured your loved ones capture and now, while you are forced to hide like a crab in the sand, are expected to welcome this fool into your ranks?\"He groaned at the memory... or even more than the memory. \"The punishment for my loutish treachery was harsh, but even a flayed back will not absolve all I have done, all I have seen. My flogging will not return parents to children or husbands to wives. My pain will not sooth the fear of mothers for their sons. And the welts upon my back will not make me forget the accusation, the pain... the sorrowin their eyes. I am doing this as much for myself as for them; doing it so that I wont have to live with my failures for an eternity.\" Willows and Fife were quiet until Fife quietly asked \"So, what now?\"\"If I cant do anything, the warriors will be swimming upstream in less than a week. When they get here... I cant promise that anyone will be safe.\" Robert looked pensive, a calculating look on his face. \"We... Iwill have to make an impression in front of Gooding. Somewhere public, somewhere will it will make an impression that cant be dismissed or ignored. Anything come to mind?\"It was then that it struck Hiriam. \"Of course, the regatta tomorrow! Gooding will be attendance, he hasto be in attendance according to College statutes. But what are you going to do?\"Having been asked, Robert began to think. \"I assume itll be on the Miskatonic?\"\"Where else? Hangmans Brook has never been deep enough for rowing and the University never affluent enough to construct a canal.\" Fife explained.\"Will there be many other people there?\" Robert asked again, something beginning to form in his already-changed brain.\"Everyone who can: students, alumni, dock workers, beggars... why do you ask?\" Hiriam was now curious as to this whole thing.Robert looked down at the staff in his hands, feeling the smooth surface but also feeling the power coursing through the object. The Staff of Dagon... said to have been wielded by their king and blessed by the mighty Priest to whom Dagon and Hydra had sworn loyalty. Once, it had been said to have performed wonders.Once... and perhaps again."]}
{"id": "EN075", "pair": ["Day 1-I never would imagine such thing would happen, in this diary I will document my strange and disturbing events. Once I was a normal respected teacher at Miskatonic, and then a member of this \"great race\" appears and teleports me to this place…its just too surreal, this place is a gigantic library, whit knowledge of humanity and more…this large creature its just disgusting, I just never saw something like this, its just bizarre. The flowers are just biologically impossible, but they are there. I am a prisoner? This place is huge, the race its big! Like a small building, I just imagine how impossibly big an entire city would be…I am like a mouse in a skyscraper. I try my best to sleep…god have mercy upon me. I have difficulty knowing what is day and what is night…because there are not windows, I have a theory that this place is underground. A few minutes after wandering around, my captor opens the massive door, ah I have forgotten, this room is almost alone without objects of my size, the only thing here is a giant sized TV with a typewriter on it. What kind of technology these creatures possess? I see that the giant clicks these claws constantly…why? Its some sort of communication? Suddenly he throws to me a metal box with a button on top of it, \"what sort of thing is this, creature?\" I ask. The giant just clicks this right claw. Without any other option I push the small cylinder, and nothing noticeable happens. But then it makes a long series of clicks again and the box suddenly begins to…talk: \"hello Wilhelm. I am a Yithnian, and I want your help. I have seen with horror that a god will crash-land on earth in two weeks! He is trapped in a suit that will retrain this great and immeasurable power. I will travel in time to bring him to you so we can begin our project\" suddenly he disappeared in an after-image. The thing he said…it was unbelievable a god exists, and he wants my help.Day…2 (i suppose) I been alone in this blank room for 4 hours…and when I was taken it was 1:30. Ok that is not the point. In this room there some sort of big book shells that dwarf by a few inches the aliens. I have opened the door to reveal that I was right, if this would be a city of gigantic size I would be like a mouse. Thousands of skyscrapers roam the underground dome that sustains the cave. This is just massive. One of the tallest buildings on earth will be like an electric floor fan compared to these hulks. Its just frightening to try to hide from these monsters. I still dont get why my captor doesnt appear yet. The buildings are made from a metal that is am mesh of golden with gray, and almost every one of them is rectangular. Three minutes remain of this wait and I see that the yith creature has returned, with a strange being in this arm. Also a book of my size; the creature started to click and the machine started to speak: \"I ask forgiveness Wilhelm, the time machine broke and I needed to fix it. Here it is…the great lord of the Outer gods, the blind idiot entity that everyone fears: Azathoth! My luck, our luck could not be greater my friend! He was trapped in the technology of my people and Mi-Gos we can make him anything we want!\" after handing me the book I have a better look at the \"God\" before me. He had a suit with long limbs; this head was highly (and horrifyingly) similar to the shape of the tall Flatiron Building in New York, in this top there were two small triangles that made the illusion of horns or wolf like ears. Little red lines in both sides of the face, (I suppose eyes) the helmet also it was colored silver. I also notice that this body has a light brown straightjacket like appearance. This right and left hands have black gloves (I suppose) with slightly long conical golden claws half of the fingers. These feet and legs are even more bizarre: black to the knees with silver to the lateral malleolus. The feet are the most structurally insane: it looks like a golden flat spike. It appears that this creature is unconscious. The book has revealed me some clues: Azathoth he is the most powerful entity in our universe, also the creator of a creator of other gods! The yiths are the race of my captor. They want to use the knowledge of my race to their disposal, what one? I dare not to put it in this diary…it would make anyone insane. The creature \"spoken\" to my again about why I am here; \"I want to give to the Outer God a new chance, one to redeem him/itself to use it as a tool for good. I will train you in a place that I made where time is infinite, where you dont need to eat, you will not exhaust, where you will not age. There I will make you a super intelligent being, due to the fact that there is technology of my race you will need to learn it. And you will make Azathoth something more than human.\" After that a door on a wall suddenly appeared, the place inside of it was blank grey. I am surprised of what I will do…I will create something to fight the unknown evil of this world! We will make this monster my monster! The yith told me that the place where we will go is applied named: Infinitely Timed Room.Day 3- the I.T.R. was excellent as a place for learning. I reckon I was there for 200 months. But I am fine to say the least. I finally learned how to manipulate the suit. It was revealed to me that there is a cube that reduces size inside of the helmet. There is a computer inside of that cube that can be modified. If I do that I can change Azathoth into a thinking creature. Also I will make him learn how to change the suit into anything he wants. I get a closer look at the monster and I can assume that he is still unconscious, or he doesnt know how to move. Thanks to a machine I built inside the I.T.R. a metal glob that can change into any human or eldritch tool I call it the anytool. I can mentally command it and only me, I change it into a buzz saw that cuts the center of the helmet. I see with awe that there are two metal cubes inside it. The one on the right has a circular window I see with my own mortal eyes what is in there: the thumb–sized daemon sultan himself. He was shaped like a tridimensional ellipse, in this surface it was covered with something similar to eggs of a fish or an amphibian, they divided the creature into two tones: in the right there where white \"eggs\" and only 3 black ones, there were 4 spiked eggs and white five tubes that have mouths. In the left there are only black eggs and 3 spiked white ones, 2 big human like jaws were located in the far left. Behind it there where mangled tentacles and claws. I see all this thanks to the anytool that I shaped into a microscope.The boxes where lead colored and they were 7cm tall and 7cm breadth. The one that is located upside is the one that constrains him and these powers, there is a mirror in the floor of the cube, the downer cube creates an incredibly thin ray that points into the mirror of the upper cube (they are epilated into a vertical position) that ray is the one that maintains this concurrent size. I cut the cube where the visor is and I slowly modify it.Day 4-I finally finalized the modification, and I closed the helmet. I created a level system: Level 1 makes him use a small bit of this power, with strength capable of lifting 50 tons. Level 2 makes him capable of creating creatures of this own, and this strength are enough powerful to level 10 buildings, Level 3…this one makes him use a quarter of this real power, he is capable of destroying a world with energy based blasts. And this physical strength is unmeasurable. Also I programed the cube (that works like a brain for Azathoth) to only to obey me, but to follow orders of any successor or member of my family.After a few hours the former god awakens and these first words are understandable: \"where…I am, what I am?\" this voice is deep and stern. I shudder what this reaction will be when I tell him the truth. Thankfully I made the upper cube make the thump sized monster a fast learner. \"My name is Wilhelm Smift, your master. Your name is Azathoth.\" The knight like creature stares at me; \"yes…Thou art. But please answer me who am i?\" \"You were a powerful creature, a god. But technological creatures transferred you into a body that constrains your power. Thankfully I have modified it to have a mind that thinks, that talks, without me you would be a blind idiot, all powerful Imbecile! You were a leader of other gods but you never made to them any commands, you where mindless. Now in turn serve me Azathoth, I will make you a tool for justice!\" the creature bows before me, but then to my fear I hear a chilling laugh, \"Why are you laughing daemon sultan?\" he talks to me slowly \"I will become a tool for extermination, isnt it master? I will become a machine only made for killing…ISNT IT MASTER?!\" he suddenly approaches me, whit these arms wide open. \"YOU MADE ME SOMETHING BETTER THAN A MINDLESS FOOL!\" he screams to the ceiling. Then he lungs at me, I expected an attack but the demon instead…hugs me. \"I cant be more grateful\" I dont know what to say, my wishes were answered, but I dread to know why such creature is happy to comply with requests for killing.", "IV.For a decade the annals of the Whateleys sink indistinguishably into the general life of a morbid community used to their queer ways and hardened to their May-Eve and All-Hallows orgies. Twice a year they would light fires on the top of Sentinel Hill, at which times the mountain rumblings would recur with greater and greater violence; while at all seasons there were strange and portentous doings at the lonely farmhouse. In the course of time callers professed to hear sounds in the sealed upper story even when all the family were downstairs, and they wondered how swiftly or how lingeringly a cow or bullock was usually sacrificed. There was talk of a complaint to the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals; but nothing ever came of it, since Dunwich folk are never anxious to call the outside world’s attention to themselves.      About 1923, when Wilbur was a boy of ten whose mind, voice, stature, and bearded face gave all the impressions of maturity, a second great siege of carpentry went on at the old house. It was all inside the sealed upper part, and from bits of discarded lumber people concluded that the youth and his grandfather had knocked out all the partitions and even removed the attic floor, leaving only one vast open void between the ground story and the peaked roof. They had torn down the great central chimney, too, and fitted the rusty range with a flimsy outside tin stovepipe.      In the spring after this event Old Whateley noticed the growing number of whippoorwills that would come out of Cold Spring Glen to chirp under his window at night. He seemed to regard the circumstance as one of great significance, and told the loungers at Osborn’s that he thought his time had almost come.      “They whistle jest in tune with my breathin’ naow,” he said, “an’ I guess they’re gittin’ ready to ketch my soul. They know it’s a-goin’ aout, an’ dun’t calc’late to miss it. Yew’ll know, boys, arter I’m gone, whether they git me er not. Ef they dew, they’ll keep up a-singin’ an’ laffin’ till break o’ day. Ef they dun’t they’ll kinder quiet daown like. I expeck them an’ the souls they hunts fer hev some pretty tough tussles sometimes.”      On Lammas Night, 1924, Dr. Houghton of Aylesbury was hastily summoned by Wilbur Whateley, who had lashed his one remaining horse through the darkness and telephoned from Osborn’s in the village. He found Old Whateley in a very grave state, with a cardiac action and stertorous breathing that told of an end not far off. The shapeless albino daughter and oddly bearded grandson stood by the bedside, whilst from the vacant abyss overhead there came a disquieting suggestion of rhythmical surging or lapping, as of the waves on some level beach. The doctor, though, was chiefly disturbed by the chattering night birds outside; a seemingly limitless legion of whippoorwills that cried their endless message in repetitions timed diabolically to the wheezing gasps of the dying man. It was uncanny and unnatural—too much, thought Dr. Houghton, like the whole of the region he had entered so reluctantly in response to the urgent call.      Toward one o’clock Old Whateley gained consciousness, and interrupted his wheezing to choke out a few words to his grandson.      “More space, Willy, more space soon. Yew grows—an’ that grows faster. It’ll be ready to sarve ye soon, boy. Open up the gates to Yog-Sothoth with the long chant that ye’ll find on page 751 of the complete edition, an’ then put a match to the prison. Fire from airth can’t burn it nohaow.”      He was obviously quite mad. After a pause, during which the flock of whippoorwills outside adjusted their cries to the altered tempo while some indications of the strange hill noises came from afar off, he added another sentence or two.      “Feed it reg’lar, Willy, an’ mind the quantity; but dun’t let it grow too fast fer the place, fer ef it busts quarters or gits aout afore ye opens to Yog-Sothoth, it’s all over an’ no use. Only them from beyont kin make it multiply an’ work. . . . Only them, the old uns as wants to come back. . . .”      But speech gave place to gasps again, and Lavinia screamed at the way the whippoorwills followed the change. It was the same for more than an hour, when the final throaty rattle came. Dr. Houghton drew shrunken lids over the glazing grey eyes as the tumult of birds faded imperceptibly to silence. Lavinia sobbed, but Wilbur only chuckled whilst the hill noises rumbled faintly.      “They didn’t git him,” he muttered in his heavy bass voice.      Wilbur was by this time a scholar of really tremendous erudition in his one-sided way, and was quietly known by correspondence to many librarians in distant places where rare and forbidden books of old days are kept. He was more and more hated and dreaded around Dunwich because of certain youthful disappearances which suspicion laid vaguely at his door; but was always able to silence inquiry through fear or through use of that fund of old-time gold which still, as in his grandfather’s time, went forth regularly and increasingly for cattle-buying. He was now tremendously mature of aspect, and his height, having reached the normal adult limit, seemed inclined to wax beyond that figure. In 1925, when a scholarly correspondent from Miskatonic University called upon him one day and departed pale and puzzled, he was fully six and three-quarters feet tall.      Through all the years Wilbur had treated his half-deformed albino mother with a growing contempt, finally forbidding her to go to the hills with him on May-Eve and Hallowmass; and in 1926 the poor creature complained to Mamie Bishop of being afraid of him.      “They’s more abaout him as I knows than I kin tell ye, Mamie,” she said, “an’ naowadays they’s more nor what I know myself. I vaow afur Gawd, I dun’t know what he wants nor what he’s a-tryin’ to dew.”      That Hallowe’en the hill noises sounded louder than ever, and fire burned on Sentinel Hill as usual; but people paid more attention to the rhythmical screaming of vast flocks of unnaturally belated whippoorwills which seemed to be assembled near the unlighted Whateley farmhouse. After midnight their shrill notes burst into a kind of pandaemoniac cachinnation which filled all the countryside, and not until dawn did they finally quiet down. Then they vanished, hurrying southward where they were fully a month overdue. What this meant, no one could quite be certain till later. None of the country folk seemed to have died—but poor Lavinia Whateley, the twisted albino, was never seen again.      In the summer of 1927 Wilbur repaired two sheds in the farmyard and began moving his books and effects out to them. Soon afterward Earl Sawyer told the loungers at Osborn’s that more carpentry was going on in the Whateley farmhouse. Wilbur was closing all the doors and windows on the ground floor, and seemed to be taking out partitions as he and his grandfather had done upstairs four years before. He was living in one of the sheds, and Sawyer thought he seemed unusually worried and tremulous. People generally suspected him of knowing something about his mother’s disappearance, and very few ever approached his neighbourhood now. His height had increased to more than seven feet, and shewed no signs of ceasing its development."]}
{"id": "EN045", "pair": ["That is the end of the story, dear readers. Believe me or not, I dont care. I ran far away from the university that evening and, to this day, I have never returned. I had to have my arm amputated after that and my burned and mangled body remains as testament to the evil I have encountered. I told the authorities it was a college fire. What else could I say?I cannot sleep well anymore. Every night I lie awake, shaking in fear in the knowledge of what exists beyond the limited scope of what we call \"reality\". What is reality? I dont know. All I do know is that this world contains more evil than can ever be imagined.The evil of the Cult of Cthulhu is still out there and I know that my days are numbered. I have seen too much. One day they will come for me and, when they do, I will let them take me. I have tried to end my life a number of times and now reside in an asylum as a result. Death will come as a relief for me.It has taken me a great deal of effort to write this, since every fibre of my being has tried to block out the memories of what happened at that university. But I need you to know. I need you to be prepared. The Cult of Cthulhu is alive and well and, one day, Cthulhu will rise and destroy this planet. It is only a matter of time.Darkness.I didnt know who I was or where I was. All I could tell was that I was falling lower and lower into a deep oblivion of blackness.Though I was unafraid.Was I dead?It didnt matter.In that place, nothing mattered.I was at peace.And then I was jerked roughly back into reality, though reality had become so distorted in my mind that I could scarcely tell the difference between what was real and what was fantasy. The first thing that I became aware of was a searing pain across my abdomen. I tried to scream, but my throat was sore as though I had been screaming for hours already. I attempted to move my arms but they were locked in place and I realised to my horror that the pain was from ropes that had been tied around me so tightly that they were literally cutting into my flesh. I spluttered for a moment as the sights and sounds of the world started to come back to me. I was tied upside down to the obelisk in the centre of the ritual space I had seen the previous night and my worst fears were realised.I was covered in blood, though whether it was my own or that of another unfortunate victim I couldnt tell. A fire surrounded me and on the other side of the flames, people in black robes were dancing wildly making noises that sounded neither human nor beastly. I began to wonder why I was still alive and why I had not been dismembered like Jonathan.Then one of the participants stepped through the flames, emerging unharmed beside me. He brandished a long silver knife and screamed \"Cthulhu Fhtagn!\" at the heavens. The figure turned down to look at me. It was Jacob, though it wasnt Jacobs eyes that looked at me, rather an empty, soulless shell of a human being. He raised the knife and I began to pray silently, expecting the end. Though it wasnt me he plunged the knife into, it was himself. He rammed the blade up to the hilt into his stomach and violently jerked it upwards, sending gory sprays of arterial blood all over my face and into my mouth and nose. Jacob then reached into his chest and began to pull out his internal organs, laughing maniacally as he did so. It was then that I found my voice and screamed louder than I had ever done, though my cries were drowned out by the diabolical beat of the drums and the bestial chants of the other cultists.Jacob did not fall to the ground as anyone else would have done. Instead, he cracked open his ribcage, revealing his empty chest cavity. An unseen force then ripped his head back, nearly severing it, his spine bent backwards and cracked and then his limbs began bending into odd angles as well. All the while, he continued in his demonic laughter, the chants of the cultists and the beat of the drums growing and growing. He contorted spasmodically, and shadowy tendrils sprung out of his body, twisting as they reached up to the sky. Suddenly, Jacobs body exploded in a shower of blood and offal although his ghoulish laugh seemed to continue somehow, and out of nowhere appeared many small winged creatures. They were less than three feet in height and completely black. No detail of their bodies was visible save for a pair of glowing green eyes. They swooped around the obelisk to which I was tied, uttering a shrieking sound unlike anything I had ever heard. As they shrieked, the dancing, chanting and beating of the drums got louder and wilder until, at its climax, the ground itself started rumbling. Cracks started to appear in the ground and water started gushing out causing the obelisk to crumble, but the fire burned ever brighter.Due to the destruction of the obelisk, the bonds that were around my middle loosened slightly. But as I tried to rise, I was violently pushed down into the water by one of the cultists who cried,\"Mighty Cthulhu! Accept our sacrifice of blood and rise again!\" With that he drew a knife of his own, but before he was able to end my existence, one of the shadowy winged creatures flew into his chest, disappearing in an instant. Suddenly, the cultists eyes literally burst into flames and he began reciting the chant I had heard so many times: \"Cthulhu Fhtagn! Cthulhu Fhtagn!\" His mouth then opened wide and I could hear his jaw bone break. Long teeth extended from the gums and before I could react, he lurched forward sinking them into my forearm.This new pain was just what I needed. I screamed in agony and ripped free. Quickly loosening the bonds around me, I leapt through the fire. Its searing heat scorched me and I felt as though a thousand knives were simultaneously being plunged into my skin. I looked desperately around for an opening to escape and noticed that all the cultists now had flaming eyes and were running at me screaming even as their heads burned in the flames from their eyes. I turned and fled, not caring about the pain in my arm or the fire that was rapidly consuming me. Not caring about the thorns and branches that eviscerated me as I ran past them. I knew I just needed to get as far away as possible.Although the screams of the ritual participants had begun to fade, I did not slow down. I just kept going and did not look back.", "I didnt stop running until I had burst into my room, locked the door behind me and placed a chair under the handle. Then I immediately vomited into the bin before collapsing onto my bed in floods of tears. I couldnt quite believe what I had seen that evening; it was too terrible to comprehend. But worse was to come.Although I so desperately wanted to sleep, I forced myself not to. Instead I sat shivering with fear in the corner of the room, expecting Jacob and Annie to attempt to enter the room any second. I had to get out of here, I had to go to the police, I had to do something. And I had to stay awake. I had to...And then I was no longer in my room. In contrast, I was standing amidst vast structures of black stone. On each stone was etched hieroglyphics of the kind I had never before seen and they were all covered in a sticky green goo. These stones seemed to go on for miles, their geometry extremely strange and disturbing. I must be dreaming, I told myself, this cant be real. Yet even in this knowledge, the sheer terror of the place engulfed me. I began to walk slowly around the structures, being careful not to touch the slime on their surface and desperately trying to wake up. And then I saw it, the monster of the notebook and the diabolical ritual. But this time, it wasnt a picture or statue but an enormous living monstrosity. I was rooted to the ground in fear as I stared at its huge form that seemed to tower for miles above me, its green, scaly skin, its thick leathery wings and its octopus-like tentacles, and from out of the air I heard the disembodied chant, \"Cthulhu Fhtagn! Cthulhu Fhtagn!\" I was still unable to run and the tentacles of the monster began to rap themselves around me, all the while that demonic chant getting louder and louder until it felt like my head was being crushed. I was raised off the ground and brought up to the monsters head. It looked at me with one of its evil red eyes the fear became too much. I began to scream hysterically, writhing around in the grip of the beast. And then I awoke, breathing heavily and sweating profusely. I was lying on the floor and just remained there for a while, staring into the darkness and reminiscing on the terrors of the dream and the ritual I had seen, and remembering that chant: \"Cthulhu Fhtagn!\" What did it all mean?The following day, I did not attend lectures and only left the room once to grab some food. As fate would have it, during this brief moment out of solitude, I met the person I didnt want to see ever again, Jacob. I avoided his gaze as he looked at me enquiringly.\"We missed you in lectures today,\" he said curiously. I didnt answer. I was sure he had seen me last night. \"Where were you?\" Jacob asked. Again, I was silent. He laid a hand on my shoulder. \"Is something wrong, James?\" It was then that I looked into his eyes but instead of the evil I had expected to see, all I could make out was concern.\"No,\" I muttered in reply.\"Something is wrong,\" Jacob disagreed. \"Whats up?\" Either hes a very good actor, or hes entirely genuine, I thought to myself. And if was being genuine, that must mean that either he didnt remember the ritual I had seen him participating in or that I had only been dreaming. I prayed it was the latter.\"Im ok,\" I said, giving him the benefit of the doubt. \"Im just feeling a little unwell, thats all.\"\"Well look after yourself,\" he replied without a trace of ingenuity. I quickly made myself a ham sandwich and once again locked myself into my room. The thoughts that raced around inside my head were endless as I casually bit into the sandwich. Almost immediately, I spat the contents out of my mouth, screamed and vomited onto the floor. What was inside the sandwich was not the ham I had put in but a vile mixture of the green goo I had seen in my \"dream\" and human blood. The room started spinning around me, turning into a dark green, and images of the tentacled creature I had seen so much of lately started appearing in every corner. I covered my ears and screamed uncontrollably.And then Jacob and Annie were in front of me. I had no idea where they had come from for I had locked the door. But I was anywhere but the comfort of my room. Instead, I was in some sort of other realm, my room rapidly beginning to fade.\"You shouldnt have got involved in this,\" Jacob whispered menacingly.\"Now you must pay.\" Annie cooed.\"In his house at Rlyeh, dead Cthulhu waits dreaming.\" they said in unison. And then I saw no more."]}
{"id": "EN073", "pair": ["In 2050 an ill-conceived invasion of earth was launched by the Kalkars, a human-like, if excessively tall, race from a world called Va-Nah. They were led by a petty dictator called Orthis. It was spectacularly unspectacular, just another failed attempt to subjugate pre-cataclysmic humanity. However, it is notable for the reason that they had brought with them one thousand Va-gas, a lavender-hued slave race of quadrupeds with human-like faces and front limbs that doubled as arms. Not particularly intelligent at this stage of their development, the Va-gas were violent and cannibalistic, (Due in part to a lack of available food on Va-Nah) even preferring Va-gas flesh over that of other races. Fierce fighters with great strength, they also bred rapidly, making them very useful to their masters, since, as well as serving as soldiers, they also served as food for their brutal masters. The Kalkars, though arguably more intelligent than the Va-gas, were even worse. They (The Kalkars) grew fat, lazy and complacent, still, for over 200 years they managed to rule earth, mainly through dumb luck and petty cruelty. Unlike H.G. Wells luckless Martian invaders in War of the Worlds, the Kalkars could survive (And breed) quite well in earths atmosphere.Torren-Wraeth played no part in the earth-Va-Nah war, Goro had died in 2042 and the youth was lost in his own private agonies and recriminations. The Great Old Ones and Outer Gods mostly stood by on the sidelines, it did not concern them whether earth was ruled by humans or Kalkars, in the end, earth belonged to them. They felt the Va-gas had potential as servants, but the Kalkars were fairly useless to them. So the war was fought, mortal against mortal, bloody and cruel as all wars are. Orthis died early in the war, but it was a costly victory, for the human leader had perished with him. For every human victory, there was a terrible loss, Mankind was thrust into loose fifedoms and petty kingdoms in what the scholars call, The Second Dark Age, and the Kalkars Empire reigned supreme. But, as with all empires, they faltered... The conquerers degenerated, forgetting the technology of their ancestors. Eventually humanity rose up and all but wiped them out with little more than swords and knives. Inter-species breeding and The Great Arising had, apparently, finished the job.The Va-gas, being even less human-like and therefore more easily despised, were nearly wiped out as well, but they had won the favor of various powerful entities who rescued and found uses for them, particularly Shub-Niggurath. Torren-Wraeth had protected a small tribe of Va-gas as well, leaving them to protect his personal sanctuary, an abandoned shrine to Tsathoggua in Canada. It was here that he kept his most valued possessions and important artifacts. Many of Goros belongings were housed within the temple, as were priceless treasures rescued from oblivion during the Great Arising. Paintings, statues, books... The history of humanity protected by descendants of alien invaders within a temple to an alien god. The Toad God himself allowed the use of his sanctuary for this purpose, as he was both Torren-Wraeths great-uncle and too lazy and indifferent to truly care.The Va-gas had become more intelligent over the centuries, and those associated with Torren-Wraeth were far less vicious than their ancestors. They even lived in a sort of uneasy peace with the nearby human tribes, by human terms, they had been civilized. Once again, Torren-Wraeth wondered if it was right to impose human standards on non-human beings: Werent they better off, not killing and eating each other? Werent the local humans safer now? Hadnt he helped them? Isnt that what the colonialists he so hated always said? It was too late to wonder about that now...Torren-Wraeth had visited Va-Nah once, and only once, it was worse than RLyeh, worse than Tond, even. Even in its current state, earth was a far better place to live than that wretched hell-hole.Torren-Wraeth glided over the burgeoning town of New Yokohama, set up by Japanese refugees hed managed to ferry safely to Canada. It was named after Goros hometown, though few knew of Torren-Wraeths prior dealings with Japan, the Emperor and Shoguns had hushed everything up. Great Cthulhu, through Torren-Wraeth, had offered to make the Japanese Empire the greatest in the world, but they had refused. They could not accept one of the terms of the agreement, they could never bear the dishonor of mixing their blood with Gyo-Jin. They had no idea that some of their people were already involved with the Gyo-Jin, as were people in coastal areas all over the world...and Torren-Wraeth had not enlightened them. People looked up and waved, Torren-Wraeth was well-liked in New Yokohama, as he had saved the original founders from certain death.The Va-gas settlement, Black-Stone-Place, was primitive, huts of wood and stone arraigned in a semi-circle around the black stone temple. Va-gas usually dwelled in Tepee-like structures, but these were settled, as guardians of the temple, they naturally remained in its vicinity. They even had a rude form of agriculture, though this was mainly for animal feed, as Va-gas vastly preferred meat over vegetables. They raised some pigs and horses for convenient food, but they were mainly hunters, deer, wild hogs, wild horses, and moose were abundant. They, like most Va-gas on earth, worshiped The Black Goat of The Woods With A Thousand Young, and a shrine of antlers and bone lay at the apex of the crescent shaped village. It was here that the Goats Dark Young came to collect their sacrifices and accept their worship, for the Dark Young were Shub-Nigguraths proxies, as Torren-Wraeth was Cthulhus.The Va-gas chieftain, Walks-With-The-Wind, met Torren-Wraeth as he landed. He stood upright on his hind limbs, and extended a three-digited paw in greeting. \"Welcome back. May The Mother of All bless you.\" His black hair was beginning to gray, but his grip was strong. \"And may she bless you, my friend.\" Torren-Wraeth replied, \"Hows hunting?\" A small crowd of Va-gas of various sizes and ages gathered around the Half-Spawn, \"The Mother has granted us abundance.\" \"Im glad to hear it. Any problems with the humans?\" Walks-With-The-Wind paused thoughtfully, \"No, humans rarely come, and none enter the temple.\" \"The guardian must be lonely.\" Of course, the guardian was never lonely, even if it did not have twelve heads to keep itself company, it lacked such mortal attributes as loneliness and boredom, but it possessed the key that made it an invaluable guardian, loyalty. At the mention of the guardian, the Va-gas drew back as one, they feared it, that terrible spirit with twelve heads on long, scraggly necks and twenty legs on its globular body. It had not been his intention to frighten the superstitious Va-gas, but he had. \"Im going to visit the temple. Thank you for guarding it so well.\" Torren-Wraeth smiled, and made his way through the parting creatures. They wouldnt set foot in the temple, they believed it to be filled with captive human souls from the Great Arising, despite Torren-Wraeths assertions to the contrary.The temple was of black stone, squat and rectangular, with massive stone doors.Torren-Wraeth entered the temple.", "The ShoggothI had met Professor Kindle during my explorations in my youth in Berlin at a convention. His theories in such subjects as physics and anatomy were peculiar to me-and to his chagrin-his colleges as well.\"Well, my boy,\" He said upon my asking why everyone seemed to mock him. \"These fools do not wish to see whats so plain that if it were a snake, it would most assuredly bite them.\"Upon that introduction, he had began to tell me how certain miniscule particles held the universe together. What he said went beyond dark matter and such unexplained universal secrets that it was almost hard to believe. But I can tell you, he was convincing. A fact that will later cause me to rethink my pursuits.\"You see, my boy, Yog-Sothoth particles and Azathoth particles exist in sub matter, in a way that can go undetected even more so than the elusive dark matter for it obviously does not refract or twist light in any such matter like anything else in space.\"\"Then how does one know of their existence?\" I asked, and for the fourth time: \"And why those names?\"It was odd to me to think that such a thing would exist that does not interact upon its surroundings. And what was queer was that the names did not follow the standard scientific tradition of Latin roots; instead appearing to be from some alien language.He smiled. \"Come, my boy, I shall show you.\" He draped an arm over my shoulders. \"And as for the names; they are from the Necromicon. A book I doubt you have read, but the names fit, believe me. For you see, Azathoth represents chaos, and Yog-Sothoth order; its like the Chinese philosophy of Yin and Yang, a philosophy I find as very true.\"Kindle took me to his hotel room where he produced from a brown briefcase, a telescope. It looked like any telescope that one could easily obtain from any store for cheap. Yet, something was off. A minor defect, yet hardly noticeable except in the right light. There was an angle of odd proportions etched out of glass and sealed within between the two lenses.\"Look, look.\" He said excitedly.I did look. And what I saw amazed me more than frightened me; as many introductory things do. What appeared to be bubbles and globular orbs of wiggling ganglia-like tentacles were stuck together. I took my eye away.\"And how do you know it keeps the universe together?\"\"It goes in a straight line across the sky.\" He said. \"Granted, its mere speculation, but I believe it to be correct, for, how many things are a perfect line in a vacuum?\"I was unable to disagree.After that, our interactions consisted of an odd letter or two. I became a physician and he became a recluse due to his latest published work that was about his Azathoth and Yog-Sothoth particles. He would only ever briefly say what he was working on. I guess he thought me a fellow conspirator, a rebel to the newly founded scientific idea; anything out of the norm is false, to the point he sent me a battered copy of the Necromicon.I read the book, horrified at what I was reading, that I am still surprised that I did not throw it to the floor and burn it. But the next letter just asked a question:Did you read it?I replied in the positive and the next response was an invitation to his little house in the sparsely populated hills of New England. I will not tell of my travels to his one story house that surprised me that such a man would live there.It was a dilapidated house that looked like time and hillbilly inhabitants before him had a wild party, trashing it beyond any sense of repairing it. When I knocked on the door and my friend opened it, I was greeted with the sight of the inside, which appeared only slightly better than the outside. The wallpaper was peeling, everything was dusty, and the lights were working, yet did not seem to help alleviate the gloom that seemed to settle upon the house in a death grip.\"Ah, its so good to see you, my boy.\" He greeted me, allowing me into the house. \"Come, please sit. I have some tea prepared for your arrival.\"I take the offered liquid and he sits on the armchair across from me. He takes a sip of his tea before setting it down upon the arm of his chair, his finger never leaving the handle.\"I invited you here to see my newest discovery.\" He said, an intense look aimed at me. Like an excited madman holding a gun.\"What is it?\"\"Shoggoths,\"He said that one word, never explaining anything, letting the dreadful word sink into my mind.\"Granted,\" He took another sip. \"I didnt discover them. But there was something that eluded me. A phrase; anyone could over look it, but I didnt. Tekeli-li.\" He almost mimicked a robot.My face turned pale at that word. Instinctual fear ingrown and nearly forgotten, left burrowed into a level of subconscious was unearthed and made me want to run faster than I have ever ran in my entire life. I knew I should have listened to it, but curiosity had gotten the better of me.\"The purpose behind it,\" Kindle continued as if there were no tension in the air. \"Eluded me. Until I started thinking in terms of wolves. Theyre very much alike, you know. Sleek killing machines with a high intelligence(though to-say-Cthulhu or Azathoth, they are stupid).\"With an interesting way to communicate.\" He smirked. \"I was proven correct by mere chance. I spied a shoggoth all alone. It cried out Tekeli-li! Tekeli-li! Another cried out in response, but this one angrier. The first spoke out and went about doing chores.\"\"Thats interesting, Kindle.\" I said. \"But how does this have to do with wolves? They howl to alert members of their pack of their location.\"\"Yes,\" Kindle said matter-of-factly. \"But wolves also have growls and other vocal ways of communicating. Shoggoths only have the one word. And to prove it, I took two Shoggoths and placed them in something similar to a rat maze.\"\"But how did you catch them?\"\"Doesnt matter.\" He snapped. \"Now let me finish, my friend.\"\"One called out and the other started to move and call out as well. This continued until they found each other. It wasnt until I caught more that I made the most startling information about them.\"My body trembles. I can only imagine what else he could have discovered about those loathsome creatures.\"I had caught six or seven of them. I crammed them into this one room below this house. It was getting cramped in there for them, so these two decided to fuse together. And it hit me! Theyre fragments! Their hive mind-like behavior, their similarities. Everything!\"\"Come, Ill show you.\"\"No,\" I snap, standing. \"Id rather not.\"Kindle becomes angered by my outburst. He grabs my arm tightly and tries to drag me towards the cellar, but I resist.\"Come, come, there is nothing to be afraid of.\"\"There is.\" I said. \"Shoggoths…\"I was cut off by a loud thunder from under our feet. Kindle pales as it happens again. He breaks from my arm and tries to run into the kitchen but he never makes it. A long, large, slimy black tentacle rises from the hole it made in the floor. I notice in sick fascination that a black, tar-like substance drips off of it. It darts towards the sound of Kindles running feet and wraps around his leg, forcing him to land, face first, onto the floor.I watch, dumb, as it drags my friend towards the hole. Kindle screams and begs me to help him, but I dont move. Fear plagues me, cementing my feet to the wood floor. It is not until his struggling form sinks into the hole that my feet can work again and I dart out of the house.Tekeli-li!(1)AAAhhhhhhhh!(1)1) These were larger(font 22), but the site messes with me!Mantineus-The ending is ambiguous by default. You see, our hero makes it out. What you see is The Shuggoth and Kindles dying scream."]}
{"id": "EN017", "pair": ["Dry hacking. The sound assaults my ears, and makes my heart begin to flutter. Its unlike any paroxysm Ive ever heard, even when Theodora contracted pneumonia two years ago. Whats far worse is I know, instinctively, that it is not she whose body is wracked with illness. Its Lemuel Dawson, on his deathbed.\"Hold on!\" My voice is lighter, younger, not yet burdened with the weight of sorrow after his passing. Like any good nurse, I rush to his side and wipe the bloody spittle from his lips with a handkerchief. This is no mere dream; its a recollection, and thats exactly what I did back then. \"Im here as always, Father.\" \"Millie,\" he says weakly, and smiles through the pain of nearly-constant coughing. \"Come closer.\" I do, and wince at his fevered breath. \"Theres something that I must tell you, at long last.\" Every word of his is belabored. His voice reminds me of a desert wind, scorched with sand. Even his sickroom has that acrid air, as if we were in the middle of the Sahara instead of Massachusetts. I myself am hot, and know Father must be. However, I dare not leave his chamber to fetch a wet cloth for fear of missing his last words.\"They have come for me, and…you must know all that I do before they come for you. Find the keys,\" he says before being consumed with another coughing fit, \"in the bottom drawer of my desk. Bring them here.\" Again I follow his directions, yet hesitantly. Throughout his life, Father had been very particular about who was allowed to touch his personal possessions, and rummage through his desks and cabinets. Even our taciturn Theodora, whod never reveal any of his secrets even under duress, was forbidden from doing so. Father gave explicit instructions on which rooms were to be cleaned (kitchen, parlor, and so on), and which were not (his spartan bedroom after Mother died, and private study). Thats why it puzzles me, in this nighttime vision as well as in life, to hear him make such a request. Nevertheless, I hurry to obey it.It takes several tugs of the aforementioned bottom drawer, sticky with disuse, to get it to yield. When it does, I cough at the dust within and pull out a small iron ring with five keys. Each one of them is different, as keys naturally are, yet these five have been bent into the most curious shapes and configurations. Im tempted to stand beside the desk and stare at them to my hearts content, fingering their bizarre metal shafts, but Fathers waiting. Not knowing what hell tell me, or what he wants me to do with the keys, I take them over to his bedside. Greedily, he grasps them in his long fingers and takes my right hand in his.\"First,\" he announces, slipping one of the unique keys into my palm. \"Second,\" he then says, doing the same with another. \"Third. Closet. Church.\" With sudden horror, I realize what they open: the three locks to the door of his forbidden study, the closet within it, and the only church to which hes ever belonged. \"The one on Gallows Hill,\" he clarifies. I wonder why hes called it that instead of Cemetery Hill. Perhaps, now that hes facing his own hangman in the form of an illness that not even Leights doctor can diagnose, images of the Purge are haunting him. \"Read and learn all you can, when youre prepared. Take care.\" I couldnt stop myself: \"Why take care? Is something wrong? Who are they, Father? Please explain!\" \"It would take…too long.\" He slowly smiles, exposing all of his teeth in the white rictus of a deaths-head. Pressing the keys so firmly into my palm that they leave mild scrapes and indentations afterward, Father coughs once more. \"Believe.\" With that, his withered hand releases mine and falls to his side limply. He is no longer alive, and our conversation has drained me so much that I can do nothing but sob in fright.I wake up to find my pillow damp, and my eyes glistening. There is no one around save for me, and the all-encompassing darkness to hide my tears. Its been seventeen years, almost to the day, since Lemuel Dawson departed this mortal world. I feel ashamed of myself, because after nearly two decades, I should not be so stricken with grief. Father, at this point in time, should be a distant memory, a framed portrait on the wall of my house and mind. However, he is not. He has evidently remained with me, in a locked compartment of my mental faculties that only dreams can reopen. Why now? Why here, in this very Inn? If the keys that he gave me so long ago - and which Ive reconfined to the drawer from which I took them - are back in his old house, then why didnt I dream about them back there? This is too strange, and scary.When youre prepared, Father had told me, read and learn all you can. Prepared for what, I wonder?", "Ordinarily, one wouldnt think of the Dreamers Inn as a mausoleum any more than one would think of the Golden Goose restaurant as a crypt. Journeymen who are just passing through Leight, and rooming at the Inn as a matter of convenience, will see nothing amiss. There are a few splintering floorboards here, and a couple of sagging roof beams there, but these things are only natural for a lodging house thats stood for more than two centuries. I, however, with my wary eyes and cautious steps, notice more ominous flaws: the dry rot in the walls, for instance, and the stairs that are almost murderously steep. How on Earth does Monsieur Thènard keep the Inn open despite its decay and stale air? Perhaps he himself has had a part in spreading rumors about it, challenging brave visitors to spend the entire night in a haunted hotel.Then again, maybe it all boils down to the Inn being the most immediate place for a nights slumber. When one is tired and hungry, weary from sitting in a carriage or on horseback, then why not stay here?\"Good evening, Mademoiselle Dawson,\" announces an oily voice. \"Welcome to the Dreamers Inn.\"My spine stiffens. If this place is a tomb, then Monsieur Thènard is the shifty undertaker whod give you your six feet of earth once you had passed, then dig you up if your relatives couldnt pay the maintenance fees. His smile resembles a scythes blade: the one that Death wields, and with which he harvests you.\"Good evening to you too, Monsieur Thènard,\" I tell him as civilly as I can. \"Id like to rent a room, please.\"\"Certainly.\" He pauses. \"I am surprised to see you here. Can you not stay at your fathers house for free?\"\"Of course, but I have my reasons. If you must know, Im on an errand to quell all the rumors about this hotel. You and I could both stand to have more revenue coming from it, after all. What better way to do that than to put vicious village talk to rest? You know what the people say: its haunted, and not by your ordinary ghosts. They also claim that certain people, once they lie down to sleep here, never awaken. Pah! If someone wakes up dead, pardon the silly expression, then their heart failed during the night, or they perished from some other natural cause. No devilry is here, and Im out to prove it once and for all.\"\"Mais oui,\" he says, grinning. \"We two know that, but how are you going to convince the rest of Leight?\"\"I intend to spend three consecutive nights here, not just one, and come out none the worse for wear. I know that the people here typically dont listen to a godless spinster. However, if I tell them that theres nothing to fear at the Dreamers Inn - save a few usual nightmares from sleeping in a strange place - perhaps they will take heed, and tell their traveling friends and relatives to pay this establishment a visit.\"\"A splendid plan,\" Thènard replies. \"I hope it works, and here is the cost of three nights lodging.\" When he reveals it, I wince. Its not exorbitant, meaning that I can still afford it, but barely. With Theodora receiving her months wages yesterday, plus my paying an ample bill of goods from the grocer, Ill be spent out by the end of my stay. Im glad that its almost the end of October: Halloween will arrive in exactly three days. Once its November, my monthly pension allowance will be full again, and I can start all over.Still, I feel like a fool. Truly, is there any starting over when one keeps going round in the same circle?\"Mademoiselle?\" Startled out of my reverie, I pay him. \"Agathe is still serving food in the kitchen,\" Thènard tells me, referring to his wizened maid-of-all-work. \"There arent enough guests for her to have served dinner in the dining room, so Im glad youve come.\" All of a sudden, he leans forward and winks at me. \"Should you require company upstairs…\"\"Give me my key, and Ill be off.\"He opens a drawer behind his porters desk and hands it over, smirking. \"Room two, second floor.\""]}
