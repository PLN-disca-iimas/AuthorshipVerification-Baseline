We wish we were little again.\n\nI tried to ride my little horsie and I bweaked him\nall to pieces.\n\nAnd I can't get enough to eat.

We dig out just the kind we want. We have caramel\nmines, and vanilla mines and mines full of chocolate almonds, and\nrivers of fig paste and strawberry ice cream soda. They flow right\nthrough the picture-book garden.\n\nOh, it must be the most wonderful place in the whole world.\n\nAnd I help take care of it. I have fourteen little\nbrothers, and we're all twins.\n\nAnd have you a mother, too? Has Santa Claus a nice-a, fine-a\nwife?\n\nOf course he's got a wife. Haven't you ever\nheard of my mother. Her name is Mary.\n\nMary? Mary what?\n\nWhy, Merry Mary Christmas, of course. I thought everyone\nknew that.\n\n And does she go round the world with Santa Claus on the night\nbefore Christmas?\n\nOh, no, she's too busy for that. She stays at home and\ntakes care of the gardens.\n\n But what are you doing here on the ship? I should think you'd\nbe with your father.\n\nAh, that is a secret.
