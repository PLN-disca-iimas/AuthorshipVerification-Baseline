You stick to me, Brocky, and I'll pull you through.

Monsieur Fleury.

The chef.

Very charmed to see you,
Monsieur Fleury.

Thank you very much.

Agatha--recitation!

Mr. Rolleston.

How do you do, Rolleston?

Mr. Tompsett.

Miss Fisher.

This is a pleasure, Miss Fisher.

If I might venture, Miss Fisher

Miss Simmons.

You are always welcome, Miss Simmons.

At last we meet.
Won't you sit down?

Mademoiselle Jeanne.

Charmed to see you, Mademoiselle Jeanne.

Mr. Treherne, this is Fisher, my maid.

Your what, Mary?

My friend.
Thomas.

How do you do, Thomas?

John.

How do you do, John?

Brocklehurst, this is John. I think you have
already met on the door-step.

Jane.

Give me your hand, Jane.

Gladys.

How do you do, Gladys. You know my uncle?

Your hand, Gladys.

Tweeny.

So happy to see you.

John, I saw you talking to Lord Brocklehurst just now; introduce
me.

That's an uncommon
pretty girl; if I must feed one of them, Ernest, that's the one.

No you don't, it won't do, Brocky. You are too
pretty, my dear. Mother wouldn't like it. Here's
something safer. Charming girl, Brocky, dying to know you; let me
introduce you. Tweeny, Lord Brocklehurst--Lord Brocklehurst, Tweeny.

They are not all here, Crichton.

Odds and ends.
Which is to recite?

And how are
all at home?

Fairish, my lord, if 'tis the horses you are inquiring for?

No, no, the family. How's the baby?

Blooming, your lordship.

A very fine boy. I remember saying so when I saw him; nice
little fellow.

Beg pardon, my
lord, it's a girl.

A girl? Aha! ha! ha! exactly what I said. I distinctly
remember saying, If it's spared it will be a girl.

Very delighted to see you, Crichton.

Mary, you know Mr. Crichton?

Milk and sugar, Crichton?

I'm ashamed to be seen talking to you, my lady.

To such a perfect servant as you all this must be most
distasteful. Oh, please do
speak, or I shall have to recite. You do hate it, don't you?

It pains me, your ladyship. It disturbs the etiquette of the
servants' hall. After last month's meeting the pageboy, in a burst of
equality, called me Crichton. He was dismissed.

I wonder--I really do--how you can remain with us.

I should have felt compelled to give notice, my lady, if the
master had not had a seat in the Upper House. I cling to that.

Do go on speaking. Tell me, what did Mr. Ernest mean by
saying he was not young enough to know everything?

I have no idea, my lady.

But you laughed.

My lady, he is the second son of a peer.

Very proper sentiments. You are a good soul, Crichton.
