I did not then. I just riz the loy and let fall the edge of
it on the ridge of his skull, and he went down at my feet like an empty
sack, and never let a grunt or groan from him at all.

And what way weren't you hanged, mister? Did you bury him then?

Aye. I buried him then. Wasn't I digging spuds in the field?

And the peelers never followed after you the eleven days that you're out?

Never a one of them, and I walking forward facing hog, dog, or divil on the highway of the road.

It's only with a common week-day kind of a murderer them lads would be trusting their carcase, and that man should be a great terror when his temper's roused.

He should then. And where was it, mister honey, that you did the deed?

Oh, a distant place, master of the house, a windy corner of high, distant hills.

He's a close man, and he's right, surely.

That'd be a lad with the sense of Solomon to have for a pot-boy,
Michael James, if it's the truth you're seeking one at all.

The peelers is fearing him, and if you'd that lad in the house
there isn't one of them would come smelling around if the dogs itself
were lapping poteen from the dungpit of the yard.

Bravery's a treasure in a lonesome place, and a lad would kill
his father, I'm thinking, would face a foxy divil with a pitchpike on
the flags of hell.

It's the truth they're saying, and if I'd that lad in the house,
I wouldn't be fearing the loosed kharki cut-throats, or the walking
dead.

Well, glory be to
God!

Would you think well to stop here and be
pot-boy, mister honey, if we gave you good wages, and didn't destroy you
with the weight of work?

That'd be a queer kind to bring into a decent quiet household with the like of Pegeen Mike.

Will you whisht? Who's speaking to you?
