'I wonder where I put my glasses?'

'I'll look for them.'

'No, I remember now. They are upstairs in such a funny
place that I must go myself. Do you remember, Rogie, that I hoped they
would reject you on account of your eyes?'

'I suppose you couldn't help it.'

'Did you believe I really meant it, John?'

'Did _you_, Roger?'

'Of course. Didn't you, father?'

'No! I knew the old lady better.'

'I shouldn't have liked it, Rogie dear. I'll
tell you something. You know your brother Harry died when he was seven.
To you, I suppose, it is as if he had never been. You were barely five.

'I don't remember him, mater.'

'No--no. But I do, Rogie. He would be twenty-one now; but
though you and Emma grew up I have always gone on seeing him as just
seven. Always till the war broke out. And now I see him a man of
twenty-one, dressed in khaki, fighting for his country, same as you.
I wouldn't have had one of you stay at home, though I had had a dozen.
That is, if it is the noble war they all say it is. I'm not clever,
Rogie, I have to take it on trust. Surely they wouldn't deceive mothers.
I'll get my glasses.'

'Like to change your mother, Roger?'

'What do you think?'

'Not going, Roger?'

'Yes, I thought--'

'Won't you--sit down and--have a chat?'

'A what? You and me!'

'Why not?'

'Oh--oh, all right,' sitting uncomfortably.

'I suppose you catch an early train to-morrow?'

'The 5.20. I have flag-signalling at half-past six.'

'Phew! Hours before I shall be up.'

'I suppose so.'

'Well, you needn't dwell on it, Roger.'

'I didn't. Good-night, father.'

'Good-night. Damn. Come back. My fault. Didn't I say I wanted to have
a chat with you?'

'I thought we had had it.'

'No such luck.'

'I like your uniform, Roger,'

'Haven't you made fun of me enough?'

'I'm not making fun of you. Don't you see I'm trying to tell
you that I'm proud of you?'

'Good lord, father, you are not going to begin now.'

'Do you remember, Roger, my saying that I didn't want you to smoke till
you were twenty?'

'Oh, it's that, is it?' Shutting his mouth tight, 'I never promised.'

'It's not that. Have a cigar, my boy?'

'Me?'

'Have you ever wondered, Roger, what sort of a fellow I am?'

'Often.'

'I have often wondered what sort of fellow you are, Roger. We have both
been at it on the sly. I suppose that is what makes a father and son so
uncomfortable in each other's presence.''Do you feel the creeps when you are left alone with me?'

'Mortally, Roger. My first instinct is to slip away.'

'So is mine,'

'You don't say so! I always seem to know what you are
thinking, Roger.'

'Do you? Same here.'

'As a consequence it is better, it is right, it is only decent that you
and I should be very chary of confidences with each other.'

'I'm dashed glad you see it in that way.'

'Oh, quite. And yet, Roger, if you had to answer this question on oath,
"Whom do you think you are most like in this world?" I don't mean
superficially, but deep down in your vitals, what would you say? Your
mother, your uncle, one of your friends on the golf links?'

'No.'

'Who?'

'You.'

'Just how I feel.'

'It's pretty ghastly, father.'

'It is. I don't know which it is worse for.'

'You are a bit of a wag at times, Roger.'

'You soon shut me up.'

'I have heard that you sparkle more freely in my absence.'

'They say the same about you.'

'And now that you mention it, I believe it is true; and yet, isn't it
a bigger satisfaction to you to catch me relishing your jokes than any
other person?'

'How did you know that?'

'Because I am so bucked if I see you relishing mine.'

'Are you?'
