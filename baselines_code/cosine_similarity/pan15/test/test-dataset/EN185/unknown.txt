Humph! He's original in that opinion.

 I know it's hard your being the only one up the week since
you've been here, with no one to talk to; but there's another patient
due to-day. Maybe she'll be well enough to be around with you. She can't be coming unless she got
in on the last train.

It's a she, eh?

Yes.

Young?

 Eighteen, I believe. I suppose you'll be asking if she's pretty next! Oh, you men
are all alike, sick or well. Her name is Carmody, that's the only other
thing I know. So there!

 Carmody?

 Oh, you don't know her. She's from another part of the
state from your town.

Miss Howard.

Yes, Miss Gilpin. It's time for those horrid diets.

I'm Miss Carmody. I believe Doctor Gaynor wrote----

 We've been expecting you all day. How do you do? I'm Miss Gilpin. You came on the
last train, didn't you?

 Yes. This is my father, Miss Gilpin--and Mr. Nicholls.

Won't you gentlemen sit down? And now we'll get you settled immediately. Your
room is all ready for you. If you'll follow me---- 

Let me take the suit-case now, Fred.

No, my dear, you mustn't. Put the case right down there, Mr. Nicholls. I'll
have it taken to Miss Carmody's room in a moment. That's the first rule
you'll have to learn. Never exert yourself or tax your strength. It's
very important. You'll find laziness is a virtue instead of a vice with
us.

I--I didn't know----

Of course you didn't. And now if you'll come
with me I'll show you your room. We'll have a little chat there and I
can explain all the other important rules in a second. The gentlemen
can make themselves comfortable in the meantime. We won't be gone more
than a moment.
