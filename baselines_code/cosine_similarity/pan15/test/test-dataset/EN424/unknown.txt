I'm tired, surely, walking wild eleven days, and waking fearful in the night. 

You should have had great people in your family, I'm thinking, with the
little, small feet you have, and you with a kind of a quality name, the
like of what you'd find on the great powers and potentates of France and
Spain.

We were great surely, with wide and windy acres of rich Munster land.

Wasn't I telling you, and you a fine, handsome young fellow with
a noble brow?

Is it me?

Aye. Did you never hear that from the young girls where you come
from in the west or south?

I did not then. Oh, they're bloody liars in the naked parish where I grew a man.

If they are itself, you've heard it these days, I'm thinking,
and you walking the world telling out your story to young girls or old.

I've told my story no place till this night, Pegeen Mike, and
it's foolish I was here, maybe, to be talking free, but you're decent
people, I'm thinking, and yourself a kindly woman, the way I wasn't
fearing you at all.

You've said the like of that, maybe, in every cot and cabin where you've met a young girl on your way.

I've said it nowhere till this night, I'm telling you, for I've seen none the
like of you the eleven long days I am walking the world, looking over a
low ditch or a high ditch on my north or my south, into stony scattered
fields, or scribes of bog, where you'd see young, limber girls, and fine
prancing women making laughter with the men.

If you weren't destroyed travelling, you'd have as much talk
and streeleen, I'm thinking, as Owen Roe O'Sullivan or the poets of the
Dingle Bay, and I've heard all times it's the poets are your like, fine
fiery fellows with great rages when their temper's roused.

You've a power of rings, God bless you, and would there be any offence if I was asking are you
single now?

What would I want wedding so young?

 We're alike, so.
