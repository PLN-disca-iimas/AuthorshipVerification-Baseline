I see the young ladies over there, and each one of them
has a young man. My, my, it does me ould heart good to see the young
folks enjoying themselves. It ain't so many years since me and Pat was
courting each other just like the rest of yeez.

Mrs. O'Toole, do you see that young man sitting there
all by his lonesome? Ain't it a shame? And him such a good looking
young feller, too. I've a good notion to go over there and cheer him
up a bit. Maybe his girl is here with another fellow.

Sure, there's plenty of girls here without any fellows
at all, at all. Why should a young man sit all alone like a bump on a
log, whin there's so many handsome colleens waiting for the chance at
him?

 Whist, Mrs. O'Toole, it's making him embarrassed yeez
are. Will you look at the red color in his face?

If ye ask me my opinion, Mollie Mulligan, sure and I
think he's after waiting fer one of yer own lovely daughters.

 Well, he might go further and fare worse. Nora Eudora's
a fine girl, if I do say it myself.

Whist, here comes Mary Ann out in front of the curtain
to spake her piece.

     LETTER TO SANTA CLAUS.

     Blessed old Santa Claus, king of delights,
     What are you doing these long winter nights?
     Filling your budgets with trinkets and toys,
     Wonderful gifts for the girls and the boys.
     While you are planning for everything nice,
     Pray let me give you a bit of advice.

     Don't take it hard if I say in your ear,
     Santa, I thought you were partial last year;
     Loading the rich folks with everything gay,
     Snubbing the poor ones who came in your way.
     Now of all times of the year I am sure
     This is the time to remember the poor.
