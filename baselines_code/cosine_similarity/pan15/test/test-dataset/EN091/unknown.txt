Who's there?

 Me.

Who's me?

The Widow Quin.

Go on now with your supper, and let on to be sleepy, for if she found you were such
a warrant to talk, she'd be stringing gabble till the dawn of day. 

What ails you, or what is it you're wanting at this hour of the night?

I'm after meeting Shawn Keogh and Father Reilly below, who told me of your
curiosity man, and they fearing by this time he was maybe roaring,
romping on your hands with drink.

Look now is he roaring, and he stretched away drowsy with his supper and his mug of milk. Walk down and tell that to Father Reilly and to Shaneen Keogh.

I'll not see them again, for I've their word to lead that lad forward for to lodge with me.

This night, is it?

This night. "It isn't fitting," says the
priesteen, "to have his likeness lodging with an orphaned girl."

God save you, mister!

God save you kindly.

Well, aren't you a little smiling fellow? It should have been great and bitter
torments did rouse your spirits to a deed of blood.

It should, maybe.

It's more than "maybe" I'm saying, and it'd soften my heart
to see you sitting so simple with your cup and cake, and you fitter to
be saying your catechism than slaying your da.

There's talking when any'd see he's fit to be holding his head high with the wonders of the world.
Walk on from this, for I'll not have him tormented and he destroyed
travelling since Tuesday was a week.

We'll be walking surely when his supper's
done, and you'll find we're great company, young fellow, when it's of
the like of you and me you'd hear the penny poets singing in an August
Fair.

Did you kill your father?

She did not. She hit himself with a worn
pick, and the rusted poison did corrode his blood the way he never
overed it, and died after. That was a sneaky kind of murder did win
small glory with the boys itself.
