Act II


SCENE--Ten days later. The stern of the deeply-laden barge, "SIMEON
WINTHROP," at anchor in the outer harbor of Provincetown, Mass. It is
ten o'clock at night. Dense fog shrouds the barge on all sides, and she
floats motionless on a calm. A lantern set up on an immense coil of
thick hawser sheds a dull, filtering light on objects near it--the
heavy steel bits for making fast the tow lines, etc. In the rear is the
cabin, its misty windows glowing wanly with the light of a lamp inside.
The chimney of the cabin stove rises a few feet above the roof. The
doleful tolling of bells, on Long Point, on ships at anchor, breaks the
silence at regular intervals.

As the curtain rises, ANNA is discovered standing near the coil of rope
on which the lantern is placed. She looks healthy, transformed, the
natural color has come back to her face. She has on a black, oilskin
coat, but wears no hat. She is staring out into the fog astern with an
Anna!  Anna!

Yes, here I am. What d'you want?

Don't you come turn in, Anna?
It's late--after four bells. It ain't good for you stay out here in
fog, Ay tank.

Why not?  I love this fog!
Honest! It's so----Funny and still.
I feel as if I was--out of things altogether.

Fog's vorst one of her dirty tricks, py
yingo!

Beefing about the sea again? I'm getting
so's I love it, the little I've seen.

Dat's foolish talk, Anna. You see her
more, you don't talk dat vay. But Ay'm glad you like it on barge. Ay'm
glad it makes you feel good again. You like
live like dis alone with ole fa'der, eh?

Sure I do. Everything's been so different from anything I ever
come across before. And now--this fog--Gee, I wouldn't have missed it
for nothing. I never thought living on ships was so different from
land. Gee, I'd just love to work on it, honest I would, if I was a man.
I don't wonder you always been a sailor.

Ay ain't sailor, Anna. And dis ain't real sea. You
only see nice part. Vell, fog lift in morning, Ay tank.

I love it! I don't give a
rap if it never lifts! It makes me feel
clean--out here--'s if I'd taken a bath.

You better go in cabin--read book. Dat put you
to sleep.

I don't want to sleep. I want to stay out here--and think about
things.

CHRIS--[Walks away from her toward the cabin--then comes back.] You act
funny to-night, Anna.

Say, what're you trying to do--make
things rotten? You been kind as kind can be to me and I certainly
appreciate it--only don't spoil it all now. Let's talk of
something else. Come. Sit down here.
