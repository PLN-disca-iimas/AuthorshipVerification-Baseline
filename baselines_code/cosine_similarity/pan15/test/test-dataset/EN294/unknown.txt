Plenty of children there are in our city,
     Who have no fathers or mothers to pity;
     Plenty of people whose working and heeding
     Scarcely can keep all their dear ones from needing.
     Now, if I came every year in December,
     These are the ones I would surely remember.

     Once on a beautiful Christmas you know
     Jesus our Saviour was born here below,
     Patiently stooping to hunger and pain,
     So He might save us, His lost ones, from shame;
     Now if we love Him, He bids us to feed
     All His poor brothers and sisters who need.

     Blessed old Nick! I was sure if you knew it,
     You would remember and certainly do it;
     This year, at least, when you empty your pack,
     Pray give a portion to all who may lack.
     Then, if there's anything left and you can
     Bring a small gift to wee Peter Pan.

   

Wasn't that dandy? Sure, little Mary Ann has a wonderful education, so she has!

She takes after her own mother. I was just like her
when I was that age.

And you're just like her still, Mollie Mulligan. Sure
you're the sunshine of Mulligan Alley and the belle of Shantytown.

Whist now! It's covered I am wid blushes. But, hush! I
think the show is about to begin.
 Come and see Jumbo, Samson symbolical!
     Come and see Slivers, Clown really comical!
     Come and see Zip, the foremost of freaks!
     Come and see Palestine's Sinister Sheiks!
     Eager Equestriennes, each unexcelled,
     Most mammoth menagerie ever beheld,
     The Giant, the Fat Girl, the Lion-faced Man,
     Aerial Artists from far-off Japan,
     Audacious Acrobats shot from a gun,
     Don't miss the greatest show under the sun!

Now, if you will kindly lend me your ears for a moment, I will fill
them free of charge with a few words concerning the world's greatest
assortment of marvelous monstrosities. In the first cell we have Senor
Macaroni Spaghetti from the land of the banana. The senor is
thirty-nine inches high, and, strangely enough, thirty-nine years old,
to say nothing of the fact that he weighs thirty-nine pounds. He arrived last week by parcel
post to join our circus. The senor is looking for a wife.
