A bloody-handed murderer the like of...

 Whisht I am saying; we'll take no fooling from your like at all.And
you, young fellow, you'd have a right to stop, I'm thinking, for we'd do
our all and utmost to content your needs.

And I'd be safe in this place from the searching law?

You would, surely. If they're not fearing you, itself, the
peelers in this place is decent droughty poor fellows, wouldn't touch a
cur dog and not give warning in the dead of night.

Let you stop a short while anyhow. Aren't you destroyed walking with your feet in bleeding
blisters, and your whole skin needing washing like a Wicklow sheep.

It's a nice room, and if it's not humbugging me you are, I'm thinking that I'll surely stay.

Now, by the grace of God, herself will be safe
this night, with a man killed his father holding danger from the door,
and let you come on, Michael James, or they'll have the best stuff drunk
at the wake.

And begging your pardon, mister, what name will we call you, for we'd like to know?

Christopher Mahon.

Well, God bless you, Christy, and a good rest till we meet
again when the sun'll be rising to the noon of day.

God bless you all.

 God bless you.

Are you wanting me to stop along with you and keep you from harm?

Didn't you say you were fearing Father Reilly?

There'd be no harm staying now, I'm thinking, and himself in it too.

You wouldn't stay when there was need for you, and let you step
off nimble this time when there's none.

Didn't I say it was Father Reilly...

Go on, then, to Father Reilly, and let him put you in the holy brotherhoods, and leave that lad to me.

If I meet the Widow Quin...

 Go on, I'm saying, and don't be waking this place with your
noise. That lad would wear the spirits from the saints of peace. timidly. Then she comes to him and speaks with bland good-humour.) Let
you stretch out now by the fire, young fellow. You should be destroyed
travelling.
