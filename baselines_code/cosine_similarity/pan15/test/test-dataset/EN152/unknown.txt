'Did you? I should have liked to see that. I have often oiled
their bats for them. Careless lads, they always forget. Was that nice
German boy with him?'

'Mr. Karl? Not far off, sir. He was sitting by the bank of the stream
playing on his flute; and Miss Barbara, she had climbed one of my
apple-trees,--she says they are your trees.'

'They are, you know, Dering,'

'Yes, sir, in a sense, but I
don't like any of you to meddle with them. And there she sat, pelting
the two of them with green apples.'

'How like her! I don't know
how we are to make a demure young lady of her.'

'They say in the village, sir, that Master Will would like to try.'

'Ha! ha! he is just a colt himself. Who
are all here now, Dering; in the house, I mean? I sometimes forget. They
grow old so quickly. They go out at one door in the bloom of youth, and
come back by another, tired and grey. Haven't you noticed it?'

'No, sir. The only visitors staying here are Miss Barbara and Mr. Karl.
There's just them and yourselves, sir, you and the mistress and Master
Will. That's all.'

'Yes, that's all,' his master says, still unconvinced. 'Who is the
soldier, Dering?'

'Soldier, sir? There is no soldier here except yourself.'

'Isn't there? There was a nurse with him. Who is ill?'

'No one, sir. There's no nurse.' Dering backs away from the old man. Would you like me to call the mistress, sir?'

'No, she has gone down to the village. She told me why, but I forget.
Miss Barbara is with her.'

'Miss Barbara is down by the stream, sir.'

'Is she? I think they said they were going to a wedding. Who is being married to-day, Dering?'

'I have heard of no wedding, sir. But here is Miss Barbara.'

'Here's the tomboy!'

'Dering, I believe you are complaining to the Colonel about my watering
the flowers at the wrong time of day.''Aha! Aha!' 

'I did just mention it, miss.'

'You horrid! Dear, don't mind him. And every time he says they are his flowers and
his apples, you tell me, and I shall say to his face that they are yours.'

'The courage of those young things!'

'Let me make you comfy--the way granny does it.'

'That is not quite the way she does it, Do
you call her granny, Barbara?'

'She asked me to--for practice. Don't you remember why?'

'I know! Billy boy.'

'You are quick today. Now, wait till I get your cane.'

'I don't need my cane while I'm sitting.'

'You look so beau'ful, sitting holding your cane. Oh dear! I am a clumsy.'

Not at all, but perhaps if I were to do it for myself. That's better. Thank you, Barbara, very much.'

'I didn't do it. I'm all thumbs. What a ghastly nurse I should make.'

'Nurse? Who is she, Barbara?'

'Who is who, dear?'

'That nurse.'

'There's no nurse here.'

'Isn't there?'

'Where is granny?'

'She has gone down to the village to a wedding.'

'There's no wedding. Who could be being married?'

'I think it's people I know, but I can't remember who they are. I
thought you went too, Barbara.'

'Not I. Catch me missing it if there had been a wedding!'

'You and the nurse.'

'Dear, you have just been imagining things again. Shall I play to you,
or sing? Oh dear, everything catches in me. Would you like me to "Robin Adair," dear?'

'No, thank you, Barbara. Barbara, the
house seems so empty. Where are Billy and Karl?'

'Billy is where Karl is, you may be sure.'

'And where is Karl?'

'He is where Billy boy is, you may be sure.'

'And where are they both?'

'Not far from where Barbara is, you bet. Do you hear Karl's flute? They have been down all the
morning at the pool where the alder is, trying to catch that bull-trout.'

'They didn't get him, I'll swear!'

'You can ask them.'

'I spent a lot of my youth trying to get that bull-trout. I tumbled in
there sixty years ago.'

'I tumbled in sixty minutes ago! It can't be the same trout, dear.'

'Same old rascal!'

'You muddy things!'

'Did you get the bull-trout, Billy boy?'

'He's a brute that.'

'He is, you know.'

BILLY. 'He came up several times and had a look at my fly. Didn't flick
it, or do anything as complimentary as that. Just yawned and went down.'

COLONEL. 'Yawned, did he? Used to wink in my time. Did you and Billy
fish at Heidelberg, Karl?'

KARL. 'We were more worthily employed, sir, but we did unbend at times.
Billy, do you remember--' He begins a gay dance.
