Yes, that's the sort of politician for my money!

Then we'll consider it settled.  Now, as the
  country is in a state of insurrection, it is absolutely necessary
  that you should assume the reins of Government at once; and,
  until it is ascertained which of you is to be king, I have
  arranged that you will reign jointly, so that no question can
  arise hereafter as to the validity of any of your acts.

As one individual?

As one individual.

Like this?

Something like that.

And we may take our friends with us, and give them places about the Court?

Undoubtedly.  That's always done!

I'm convinced!

So am I!

Then the sooner we're off the better.

We'll just run home and pack up a few things (going)--

 Stop, stop--that won't do at all--ladies are not
  admitted.

 What!

 Not admitted.  Not at present.  Afterwards, perhaps.  We'll see.

Why, you don't mean to say you are going to separate
  us from our wives!

This is very awkward! Only for a time--a few months.  Alter all, what is a few months?

 But we've only been married half an hour! 

                          
            Kind sir, you cannot have the heart
                      Our lives to part
                 From those to whom an hour ago
                           We were united!
            Before our flowing hopes you stem,
                      Ah, look at them,
                 And pause before you deal this blow,
                           All uninvited!
            You men can never understand
                      That heart and hand
                 Cannot be separated when
                           We go a-yearning;
            You see, you've only women's eyes
                      To idolize
                 And only women's hearts, poor men,
                           To set you burning!
            Ah me, you men will never understand
            That woman's heart is one with woman's hand!

            Some kind of charm you seem to find
                      In womankind--
                 Some source of unexplained delight
                           (Unless you're jesting),
            But what attracts you, I confess,
                      I cannot guess,
                 To me a woman's face is quite
                           Uninteresting!
            If from my sister I were torn,
                      It could be borne--
                 I should, no doubt, be horrified,
                           But I could bear it;--
            But Marco's quite another thing--
                      He is my King,
                 He has my heart and none beside
                           Shall ever share it!
            Ah me, you men will never understand
            That woman's heart is one with woman's hand!
