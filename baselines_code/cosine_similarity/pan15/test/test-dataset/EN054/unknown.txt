And now tell me, have you
been to the Opera? What sort of weather have you been having in the
kitchen? For Heaven's sake, woman, be articulate.

No, my lady; his lordship may
compel us to be equal upstairs, but there will never be equality in the
servants' hall.

What's that? No equality? Can't you see,
Crichton, that our divisions into classes are artificial, that if we
were to return to nature, which is the aspiration of my life, all would
be equal?

If I may make so bold as to contradict your lordship--

Go on.

The divisions into classes, my lord, are not artificial. They
are the natural outcome of a civilised society. There
must always be a master and servants in all civilised communities, my
lady, for it is natural, and whatever is natural is right.

It is very unnatural for me to stand here and allow
you to talk such nonsense.

Yes, my lord, it is. That is what I have been
striving to point out to your lordship.

What is the matter with Fisher? She is looking
daggers.

The tedious creature; some question of etiquette, I suppose.

How are you, Fisher?

I am nothing, my lady, I am nothing at
all.

Oh dear, who says so?

His lordship has asked that kitchen wench to have a
second cup of tea.

But why not?

If it pleases his lordship to offer it to her before offering it
to me--

So that is it. Do you want another cup of tea, Fisher?

No, my lady--but my position--I should have been asked first.

Oh dear.My friends, I am glad to see you all looking so happy. It
used to be predicted by the scoffer that these meetings would prove
distasteful to you. Are they distasteful? I hear you laughing at the
question.

No harm in saying that among us to-day is one who was formerly hostile
to the movement, but who to-day has been won over. I refer to Lord
Brocklehurst, who, I am sure, will presently say to me that if the
charming lady now by his side has derived as much pleasure from his
company as he has derived from hers, he will be more than satisfied.

For the time being the artificial and unnatural--I say unnatural--barriers of society are swept
away. Would that they could be swept away for ever.

But that is entirely and utterly out of the question. And now for a few
months we are to be separated. As you know, my daughters and Mr. Ernest
and Mr. Treherne are to accompany me on my yacht, on a voyage to distant
parts of the earth. In less than forty-eight hours we shall be under
weigh.

Do not think our life on the yacht is to be one long idle holiday. My
views on the excessive luxury of the day are well known, and what I
preach I am resolved to practise. I have therefore decided that my
daughters, instead of having one maid each as at present, shall on this
voyage have but one maid between them.

My lord!

My mind is made up.

I cordially agree.

And now, my friends, I should like to think that there is
some piece of advice I might give you, some thought, some noble saying
over which you might ponder in my absence. In this connection I remember a proverb, which has had a great effect on my own life. I first heard
it many years ago. I have never forgotten it. It constantly cheers and
guides me. That proverb is--that proverb was--the proverb I speak of--
Oh dear, I believe he has forgotten it.

The proverb--that proverb to which I refer--

I have it now--(not he).

Crichton.

One maid among three grown women!

Mary, I think I had better go. That dreadful
kitchenmaid--

I can't blame you, George.

Your father's views are shocking to me, and I am glad
I am not to be one of the party on the yacht. My respect for myself,
Mary, my natural anxiety as to what mother will say. I shall see you,
darling, before you sail.

Selfish brute, only thinking of himself. What about my speech?

One maid among three of us. What's to be done?

Pooh! You must do for yourselves, that's all.

Do for ourselves. How can we know where our things are kept?

Are you aware that dresses button up the back?

How are we to get into our shoes and be prepared for the
carriage?

Who is to put us to bed, and who is to get us up, and how
shall we ever know it's morning if there is no one to pull up the
blinds?
