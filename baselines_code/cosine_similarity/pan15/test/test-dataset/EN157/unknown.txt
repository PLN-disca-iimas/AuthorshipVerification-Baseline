Oh, ho, ho, ho! That's the funniest
wish I ever heard since I've been in the wishing business. So you want
to be the very biggest children there are anywhere, do you?

Yes, sir; that's just what we want. I want to be a great, big,
tall little girl.

A great, big tall little girl, hey?

And I want to be a great, big, big, big little boy.

Oh, a big, big, BIG little boy, hey?

And so do I.

And so do you, hey?

Yes, sir; that is our wish.

Well, I'll have to see if I can accommodate you. It's a
pretty big job, you know.

You said you could give us anything we wished for.

 But I didn't think you'd wish for anything like that.

 That's the only thing we want, Mr Wishing Man.

 Well, now--let me see. I'm afraid it's too big a job for me. In the first
place I haven't any marble.

Marble?

Yes. In order to make you grow and grow and grow, you'll have to stand on marble.

 We have a marble-top table in the front hall.

Oh, yes. And we can all stand on top of the table.

But I have to stand here by the open window.

Well, we can go in there and leave the door open. You can stay
here and make our wish come true. Come on, Dumpling.

Wait a minute, wait a minute. Are you all of you sure you
want to be made into great big, big little children?

Yes, all of us.

All right. If that's your wish, it's no business of mine.
Go out in the front hall and climb on the marble-top table and I'll
see what I can do for you.
