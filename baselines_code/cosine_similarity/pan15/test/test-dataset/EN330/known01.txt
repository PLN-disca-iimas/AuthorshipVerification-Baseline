Is it dreaming I am?

Drink it and you'll find it ain't no dream.

To hell with the drink--but I'll take it just the same.  Aah! I'm needin' that--and 'tis fine stuff. But 'twasn't the booze I
meant when I said, was I dreaming. I thought you was some mermaid out
of the sea come to torment me. 
Aye, rale flesh and blood, divil a less.

Cut that.

But tell me, isn't this a barge I'm on--or isn't it?

Sure.

And what is a fine handsome woman the like of you doing on this
scow?

Never you mind. 
Say, you're a great one, honest--starting right in kidding after what
you been through.

Ah, it was nothing--aisy for a rale man
with guts to him, the like of me. All in the day's work,
darlin'. But I won't be denying 'twas a damn narrow squeak.
We'd all ought to be with Davy Jones at the bottom of the sea, be
rights. And only for me, I'm telling you, and the great strength and
guts is in me, we'd be being scoffed by the fishes this minute!

Gee, you hate yourself, don't you? Well, you'd better come in and
lie down. You must want to sleep.

Lie down and sleep, is it? Divil a wink I'm
after having for two days and nights and divil a bit I'm needing now.
Let you not be thinking I'm the like of them three weak scuts come in
the boat with me. I could lick the three of them sitting down with one
hand tied behind me. They may be bate out, but I'm not--and I've been
rowing the boat with them lying in the bottom not able to raise a hand
for the last two days we was in it.  And I can lick all hands on this tub, wan
be wan, tired as I am!

Gee, ain't you a hard guy!  But never mind
that fight talk. I'll take your word for all you've said. Go on and sit
down out here, anyway, if I can't get you to come inside. You're all in, you might as well own up to it.

The hell I am!

Well, be stubborn then for all I care. And I must say I
don't care for your language. The men I know don't pull that rough
stuff when ladies are around.

Ladies!Ho-ho! Divil mend you! Let you not be making game of me. What would
ladies be doing on this bloody hulk?  Aisy, now! You're not the old
Square-head's woman, I suppose you'll be telling me next--living in his
cabin with him, no less!  But
I do be thinking, iver since the first look my eyes took at you, that
it's a fool you are to be wasting yourself--a fine, handsome girl--on a
stumpy runt of a man like that old Swede. There's too many strapping
great lads on the sea would give their heart's blood for one kiss of
you!
