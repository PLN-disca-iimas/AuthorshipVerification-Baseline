Then I run, and I run, and I run,
till I was below in Rathvanna. I got drunk that night, I got drunk
in the morning, and drunk the day after,--I was coming from the races
beyond--and the third day they found Darcy.... Then I knew it was
himself I was after hearing, and I wasn't afeard any more.

God spare Darcy, he'ld always
look in here and he passing up or passing down, and it's very lonesome
I was after him a long while and then I got happy again--if it's ever
happy we are, stranger,--for I got used to being lonesome. 

Was there any one on the last bit of the road, stranger, and you
coming from Aughrim?

There was a young man with a drift of mountain ewes, and he
running after them this way and that.

Far down, stranger?

A piece only.

Maybe, if you're not easy afeard, you'ld stay here a short while
alone with himself.

I would surely. A man that's dead can do no hurt.

I'm going a little back to the west, stranger, for himself would go there one night and another
and whistle at that place, and then the young man you're after
seeing--a kind of a farmer has come up from the sea to live in a cottage
beyond--would walk round to see if there was a thing we'ld have to be
done, and I'm wanting him this night, the way he can go down into the
glen when the sun goes up and tell the people that himself is dead.

It's myself will go for him, lady of the house, and let you not be destroying yourself with the great rain
