In the regrettable slang of the servants' hall, my lady, the
master is usually referred to as the Gov.

I see. You--

Yes, I understand that is what they call me.

You didn't even take your meals with
the family?

No, my lady, I dined apart.

You, girl, also? Did you dine with Crichton?

No, your ladyship.

With whom?

I took my bit of supper with--with Daddy and Polly and the rest.

Dear old Daddy--he was our monkey. You
remember our monkey, Agatha?

Rather! What a funny old darling he was.

And don't you think Polly was the sweetest
little parrot, Mary?

Ah! I understand; animals you had domesticated?

Quite so--quite so.

The servants' teas that used to take place here once
a month--

They did not seem natural on the island, my lady, and were
discontinued by the Gov.'s orders.

A clear proof, Loam, that they were a mistake here.

I admit it frankly.
I abandon them. Emily, as the result of our experiences on the island, I
think of going over to the Tories.

I am delighted to hear it.

Thank you, Crichton, thank you; that is all.

One moment. Young people, Crichton, will be young people, even on an island; now,
I suppose there was a certain amount of--shall we say sentimentalising,
going on?
Yes, my lady, there was.

Mother!

Which gentleman? You,
girl, tell me.

If you please, my lady--

The fact is--

It was him--Mr. Ernest, your ladyship.

With which lady?

I have already told you, Lady Brocklehurst, that Ernest and I--

Yes, now; but you were two years on the island. Was it this lady?

No, your ladyship.

Then I don't care which of the others it was. Well, I suppose that will do.

Do! I hope you are ashamed of yourself, mother. You are an excellent fellow, Crichton; and if,
after we are married, you ever wish to change your place, come to us.

Oh no, impossible--

Why impossible?  Do you see why it should be
impossible, my man?

Yes, my lady. I had not told you, my lord, but as soon as
your lordship is suited I wish to leave service.

What will you do, Crichton?

Shall I withdraw, my lord?

Horrid of me, wasn't it? But if one wasn't disagreeable now and again, it would
be horribly tedious to be an old woman. He will soon be yours, Mary, and
then--think of the opportunities you will have of being disagreeable to
me. On that understanding, my dear, don't you think we might--? 

Quite so--quite so. 
To wish you every dear happiness.

The same to you, my lady.

Do you despise me, Crichton? You are the best man among us.

On an island, my lady, perhaps; but in England, no.

Then there's something wrong with England.

My lady, not even from you can I listen to a word against
England.

Tell me one thing: you have not lost your courage?

No, my lady.
