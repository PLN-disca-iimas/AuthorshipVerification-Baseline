You say right tang, Anna, py golly! It ain't nobody's
fault! It's dat ole davil, sea!

Gee, won't you ever can that stuff?
You said a minute ago you'd fixed something up--about me.
What was it?

Ay'm shipping avay on sea again,
Anna.

You're--what?

Ay sign on steamer sail to-morrow. Ay gat my ole yob--bo'sun.
Ay tank dat's best tang for you. Ay only bring you bad luck, Ay
tank. Ay make your mo'der's life sorry. Ay don't vant make yours dat
way, but Ay do yust same. Dat ole davil, sea, she make me Yonah man
ain't no good for nobody. And Ay tank now it ain't no use fight with
sea. No man dat live going to beat her, py yingo!

So that's how you've fixed
me, is it?

Yes, Ay tank if dat ole davil gat me back she leave you alone
den.

But, for Gawd's sake, don't you see, you're doing the
same thing you've always done? Don't you see--? But what's the use of talking. You ain't right, that's
what. I'll never blame you for nothing no more. But how you could
figure out that was fixing me--!

Dat ain't all. Ay gat dem fallars in steam-ship office to pay
you all money coming to me every month vhile Ay'm avay.

Thanks. But I guess I won't be hard up for
no small change.

It ain't much, Ay know, but it's plenty for keep
you so you never gat go.

Shut up, will you? We'll talk about it later, see?

You like Ay go ashore look for
dat Irish fallar, Anna?

Not much! Think I want to drag him back?

Py golly, dat booze don't go
veil. Give me fever, Ay tank, Ay feel hot like hell.

What you got in your pocket, for Pete's sake--a
ton of lead? [She reaches down, takes the coat and pulls out a
revolver--looks from it to him in amazement.] A gun? What were you
doing with this?
