Bless my heart, how unfortunate!  One of you may be
  Baptisto's son, for anything I know to the contrary; but the
  other is no less a personage than the only son of the late King
  of Barataria.

What!

And I trust--I trust it was that one who slapped me
  on the shoulder and called me his man!One of us a king!

Not brothers!

The King of Barataria!  

 Well, who'd have thought it!

But which is it?

What does it matter?  As you are both Republicans,
  and hold kings in detestation, of course you'll abdicate at once.
  Good morning!

 Oh, don't do that!  

 Well, as to that, of course there are kings and kings.
  When I say that I detest kings, I mean I detest bad kings.

 I see.  It's a delicate distinction.

Quite so.  Now I can conceive a kind of king--an ideal
  king--the creature of my fancy, you know--who would be absolutely
  unobjectionable.  A king, for instance, who would abolish taxes
  and make everything cheap, except gondolas--

And give a great many free entertainments to the
  gondoliers--

And let off fireworks on the Grand Canal, and engage
  all the gondolas for the occasion--

And scramble money on the Rialto among the gondoliers.

Such a king would be a blessing to his people, and if
  I were a king, that is the sort of king I would be.

And so would I!

Come, I'm glad to find your objections are not insuperable.

Oh, they're not insuperable.

No, they're not insuperable.

Besides, we are open to conviction.

 Yes; they are open to conviction.

 Oh! they've often been convicted.

 Our views may have been hastily formed on insufficient
  grounds.  They may be crude, ill-digested, erroneous.  I've a
  very poor opinion of the politician who is not open to
  conviction.

Oh, he's a fine fellow!
