  Oh, give me a nice little home,
     And plenty of suds in me tub,
 And I will be happy all day,
     With me rubby-dub, rubby-dub, dub.

     The queen on her golden throne,
     Will envy me here at me tub,
     For no one's as jolly as I,
     With me rubby-dub, rubby-dub, dub.

     Sure, what would I do at a dance?
     Or what would I do at a club?
     But here in me kitchen I'm queen
     With me rubby-dub, rubby-dub, dub.

     Oh, give me a nice little home,
     And plenty of suds in me tub,
     And I will be happy all day,
     With me rubby-dub, rubby-dub, dub!

 Maw, don't you think it's most time fer us to be going?

Time to be going, is it? Well, I should hope not. Sure,
half of the children are not dry yet, and the other half are not
dressed. Bridget Honora, darlin', look in the other room and see how
they're coming on.

I think we ought to be there early, so as we can get a good
seat on the front row. I don't want to miss nothing. 

 True for you, Matsy, and I don't want yeez to be
missing anything either. It ain't like as if yeez go to a fine
Christmas entertainment ivery night of yer lives.

 It's the first one any of us ever went to at all, at all. Do
yeez think they be after having moving pictures?

Of course not. Not in a Sunday School, Matsy. But
belike they'll have a fine, grand Christmas tree with singin' and
spaches and fine costumes and prisints for every one.  Bridget Honora!

 Yes, maw?

Come here.

Melissa and Micky Machree have been scrubbed until they
shine. They're sitting in the window drying in the sun. Mary Ann is
cleaning Peter Pan in the lard bucket, and Patsy is washing Teddy
Magee in the rain-barrel. Nora is curling Clarissa's hair with the
poker, and somebody's untied the goat.

 Untied the goat, is it? Matsy Mulligan, put on yer hat
at once and see what's become of Shamus O'Brien. He's a good goat, is
Shamus, but he's like the late Mr. Mulligan, he has a rovin'
disposition and a tremenjous appetite. Hurry now, Matsy.
