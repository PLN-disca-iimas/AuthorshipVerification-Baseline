'Bout your size.  Oh! Jim, go along!

No fear!  What's a blighter like that to old Fritz's
shells?  We didn't shift when they was comin'.  If you'll go, I'll
go; not else.

 Jim, do you love me true?

I ain't ashamed--I ain't ashamed.  If 'e could see me 'eart.

Daisy!  If I'd known you out there, I never could 'a stuck
it.  They'd 'a got me for a deserter.  That's how I love you!

Jim, don't lift your hand to 'im!  Promise!

That's according.

Promise!

If 'e keeps quiet, I won't.  But I'm not accountable--not
always, I tell you straight--not since I've been through that.

Nor p'raps he isn't.

Like as not.  It takes the lynch pins out, I tell you.

 God 'elp us!

Ah!  We said that a bit too often.  What we want
we take, now; there's no one else to give it us, and there's no
fear'll stop us; we seen the bottom of things.

P'raps he'll say that too.

Then it'll be 'im or me.

I'm frightened:

No, Daisy, no!  The river's handy.  One more or less.  'E shan't 'arm you; nor me neither. 

Oh, no!  Give it to me, Jim!


No fear!  Shan't 'ave no need
for it like as not.  All right, little Daisy; you can't be expected
to see things like what we do.  What's life, anyway?  I've seen a
thousand lives taken in five minutes.  I've seen dead men on the
wires like flies on a flypaper.  I've been as good as dead meself a
hundred times.  I've killed a dozen men.  It's nothin'.  He's safe,
if 'e don't get my blood up.  If he does, nobody's safe; not 'im, nor
anybody else; not even you.  I'm speakin' sober.
