If 'e keeps quiet, I won't.  But I'm not accountable--not
always, I tell you straight--not since I've been through that.

 Nor p'raps he isn't.

Like as not.  It takes the lynch pins out, I tell you.

God 'elp us!

Ah!  We said that a bit too often.  What we want
we take, now; there's no one else to give it us, and there's no
fear'll stop us; we seen the bottom of things.

P'raps he'll say that too.

Then it'll be 'im or me.

 I'm frightened:

No, Daisy, no!  The river's handy.  One more or
less.  'E shan't 'arm you; nor me neither.  [He takes out a knife.]

 Oh, no!  Give it to me, Jim!

No fear! Shan't 'ave no need
for it like as not.  All right, little Daisy; you can't be expected
to see things like what we do.  What's life, anyway?  I've seen a
thousand lives taken in five minutes.  I've seen dead men on the
wires like flies on a flypaper.  I've been as good as dead meself a
hundred times.  I've killed a dozen men.  It's nothin'.  He's safe,
if 'e don't get my blood up.  If he does, nobody's safe; not 'im, nor
anybody else; not even you.  I'm speakin' sober.

Jim, you won't go fightin' in the sun, with the birds all callin'?

That depends on 'im.  I'm not lookin' for it.  Daisy, I
love you.  I love your hair.  I love your eyes.  I love you.

And I love you, Jim.  I don't want nothin' more than you
in all the world.

Amen to that, my dear.  Kiss me close!

   "I'll be right there to-night,
    Where the fields are snowy white;
    Banjos ringing, darkies singing,
    All the world seems bright."

It's him!
