He's fur me. Scwumptious!

Maw, they had a show there at the Sunday School. There was a
wee little man, about so long and he
stood up on a table and sang a song, so he did.

 Humph! I know how they did that. Matsy and me can show it to
you.

And they had the Turnover Topsy Turvies, too.

They stood upside down on their heads.

 My, my--but it must have been a wonderful show.

Just think what we missed, Mollie Mulligan.

 I didn't miss nothin'. I never miss nothin' no time.

We could give just as good a show our own selves.

Let's do it; let's do it. Let's give a show for maw and Mis'
O'Toole.

 Would you like to see it, maw?

If it ain't too late.

 What matters it how late it is? Christmas comes but once
a year----

And when it comes it brings good cheer.

 Then sure we'll have the show. Poor folks can be just
as happy on Christmas Day as rich folks. It's all in the way you feel
about it.

Now, maw, you and Mrs. O'Toole take your seats out there in
front. 

I'll help you carry them out.

 Now, we'll have to draw the curtain to get the stage ready.

And while we're getting ready Mary Ann can say her piece.

 My, my, Kathleen, what a large crowd of
people are here tonight. I'm afraid I'm not dressed up for the
occasion.

 Dressed up, is it? Indade you are. Ye have on short
sleeves and a low-neck dress. What more would ye want? There's the
minister and his wife setting right back there. 
Good avening, Brother ----; sure, it's a fine avening we're having, is
it not?

My, my, is it yourself, Mrs. ----? Sure, I'm glad to see ye out. It's a long time
since I've had the pleasure of seeing you.  And there's ---- and ---- and ----. I'm glad to see all of
yeez. Sure, some day yeez must come over to me house in Mulligan Alley
and I'll let you play with the goat, Shamus O'Brien.
