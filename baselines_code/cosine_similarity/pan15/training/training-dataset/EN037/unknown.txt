 Now, sir, we're all ready for rehearsal of
"Orpheus with his Lute."

"Orphoos with his loot!"  That his
loot, Mr Vane?  Why didn't he pinch something more precious?  Has
this high-brow curtain-raiser of yours got any "pep" in it?

It has charm.

I'd thought of "Pop goes the Weasel" with little Miggs.  We
kind of want a cock-tail before "Louisa loses," Mr Vane.

Well, sir, you'll see.

This your lighting?  It's a bit on the spiritool side.  I've
left my glass.  Guess I'll sit in the front row.  Ha'f a minute.  Who
plays this Orphoos?

George Fleetway.

Has he got punch?

It's a very small part.

Who are the others?

Guy Toone plays the Professor; Vanessa Hellgrove his wife;
Maude Hopkins the faun.

H'm!  Names don't draw.

They're not expensive, any of them.  Miss Hellgrove's a find,
I think.

Pretty?

Quite.

Arty?

No. Look here, Mr FRUST,
it's no use your expecting another "Pop goes the Weasel."

We-ell, if it's got punch and go, that'll be enough for me.
Let's get to it!

Mr Foreson?

Sir?

Beginners.  Take your curtain down.

Some voice!

"Orpheus symbolized the voice of Beauty, the call of life,
luring us mortals with his song back from the graves we dig for
ourselves.  Probably the ancients realized this neither more nor less

"Orpheus symbolized the voice of Beauty, the call of life,
luring us mortals with his song back from the graves we dig for
ourselves.  Probably the ancients realized this neither more nor less than we moderns.  Mankind has not changed.  The civilized being still
hides the faun and the dryad within its broadcloth and its silk.  And
yet"--[He stops, with a dried-up air-rather impatiently]  Go on, my
dear!  It helps the atmosphere.
