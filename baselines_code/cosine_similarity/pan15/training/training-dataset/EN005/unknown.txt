Who'll it be? Ah, it's Fred Nicholls, maybe. Eileen's young
man, Doctor, that she's engaged to marry, as you might say.

 H'mm--yes--she spoke of him.

I had a mind to phone to your house, but I
wasn't wishful to disturb you, knowin' you'd be comin' to call
to-night.

It's nothing serious, I hope.

Ah, who knows? Here's the doctor. You've not
met him?

I haven't had the pleasure. Of course, I've heard----

It's Doctor Gaynor. This is Fred Nicholls, Doctor. Sit down, Fred, that's a
good lad, and be talkin' to the Doctor a moment while I go upstairs and
see how is Eileen. She's all alone up there.

Certainly, Mr. Carmody. Go ahead--and tell her how sorry I am
to learn she's under the weather.

I will so. 

Do you happen to be any relative to the Albert Nicholls who is superintendent
over at the Downs Manufacturing Company?

He's sort of a near relative--my father.

Ah, yes?

I work for the Downs Company
myself--bookkeeper----

 Miss Carmody--the sick girl upstairs--she had a position there
also, didn't she, before her mother died?

Yes. She had a job as stenographer for a time. When she
graduated from the business college course--I was already working at
the Downs--and through my father's influence--you understand. She was getting on finely, too, and liked the work.
It's too bad--her mother's death, I mean--forcing her to give it up and
come home to take care of those kids.

It's a damn shame. That's the main cause of her breakdown.

I've noticed she's been looking badly lately. So
that's the trouble? Well, it's all her father's fault--and her own,
too, because whenever I raised a kick about his making a slave of her,
she always defended him. Between us, Carmody's as selfish as they make 'em,
if you want my opinion.
