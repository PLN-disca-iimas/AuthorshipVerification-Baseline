Dogs take to her.  That's a sure sign.

Little things--one can always tell.

 Something very attractive about her--what!  Fine build
of woman.

I shall get hold of her for parish work.

 Ah!  Excellent--excellent!  Do!

 Wonder if her husband shoots?  She seems
quite-er--quite----

 Quite!  Altogether charming; one of the nicest faces I ever saw.


Oh!  Doctor--have you? is it----?

Right as rain!  She held him like an angel--he just licked her, and never made a sound.

Poor darling!  Can I----

    

Better leave 'em a minute.  She's moppin' 'im off. Wonderful clever hands!

 I say--who is she?

 Who?  Well--there you have me!  All I know is
she's a first-rate nurse--been helpin' me with a case in Ditch Lane.
Nice woman, too--thorough good sort!  Quite an acquisition here.
H'm!  Excuse me hurryin' off--very
late.  Good-bye, Rector.  Good-bye, Lady Ella.  Good-bye!



 H'm!  I suppose we ought to be a bit careful.

 
 Beg pardon, sir.  Is the little dog all right?

Yes.

Seein' you've missed your train, m'm, shall I wait, and take you 'ome again?

 No.

Cert'nly, m'm.  

 Oh, Jarvis--what's the name of the people here?

Challenger's the name I've driven 'em in, my lady.

Challenger?  Sounds like a hound.  What's he like?

  Wears a soft 'at, sir.

 H'm!  Ah!

Very nice gentleman, very nice lady.  'Elped me with my old
mare when she 'ad the 'ighsteria last week--couldn't 'a' been kinder
if they'd 'a' been angels from 'eaven.  Wonderful fond o' dumb
animals, the two of 'em.  I don't pay no attention to gossip, meself.

Gossip?  What gossip?

 Did I make use of the word, m'm?  You'll excuse
me, I'm sure.  There's always talk where there's newcomers.  I takes
people as I finds 'em.
