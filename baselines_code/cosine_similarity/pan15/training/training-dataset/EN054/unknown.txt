Oh, lookee at the tin soldiers. They're awful big. Can I have
one, Mr. Wishing Man?

I don't think they're quite ripe yet.

Me want a twumpet. Want a nice, big twumpet to blow.

There you are, my little man.

I want one, too. A nice loud one.

And there's one for you, Tootsy.

Believe I'll take a drum.

There you are. Right off the tree.

Now we'll have a parade. 

Here, here, wait a minute. You're making enough noise to
wake the dead. Hold on, there. Quiet, quiet!

Oh, dear! Just as we were having such a lovely time.

 Oh, whee! See the funny box. What is in it, Mr. Wishing Man?

You'd better let it alone. That's Ka-zin-ski, and Ka-zin-ski doesn't like babies.

 But I wish to see him.

Is it a wish?

Yes, sir; it's a wish.

Then pull the string.

 Oh, whee! Take him away! I'm fwightened, I am. Vill he come
after me?

No, no. Get up, 'ittie Snookie Ookums, he won't hurt you.

Say, Mr. Wishing Man?

What is it, my little boy?

Can we have anything we wish for here in the Wishing Land?

Of course you can. That's what the Wishing Land is for.

Then I wish I was a little boy again. I'm too big to enjoy myself.

 And I wish I was a little girl again. Everybody laughs at me, 'cause I'm so big.

 And I wish I was a 'ittie, teeny, weeny baby again. Being so
big fwightens me so.

 Oh, ho! So you all want to be little again?

Yes, sir, if you please.

Why, I'm so big that I can't get all of me into bed. I'll have
to let my feet hang outside.
