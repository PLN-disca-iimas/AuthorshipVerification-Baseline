 Tommy, do lend a hand!

All right, Ella; all right!  He doesn't mean what you
mean!

 Hold him, Tommy. He's sure to smell out Hannibal!


Jove!  Clever if he can smell anything but himself.  Phew!  She ought
to have the Victoria Cross for goin' in that pond.

So very sorry--had to have a bath, and change, of course!

We're so awfully grateful to you.  It was splendid.

 Quite.

Heroic!  I was just myself about to----

 Little beast will fight--must apologise--you were too quick for me----

 Poor dears!  They thought they were so safe in that nice pond!

Is he very badly torn?

 Rather nasty.  There ought to be a stitch or two put in his ear.

I thought so.  Tommy, do----

 All right.  Am I to let him go?

No.

 The fly's outside.  Bertie, run and tell Jarvis to drive in for the Vet.

 Run?  Well, Maud--I----

 The doctor would sew it up.  My maid can go round.

   
 Look!  Catch him!  Rector!

 Bertie!  Catch him!

Take this strop--he can't break that.  And would these be any
good to you?


 Splendid, isn't she?  I do admire her.

 She's all there.

Most kind.

    Eh?

 Yes.

 Ah!

 Poor darling!

  Ella, the Rector wants to get up!

 Perhaps--just for a moment----

Oh!  

   
  So she's married!

Why?

 Braces.

Oh!  Yes.  We ought to ask them to dinner, Tommy.

Ah!  Yes.  Wonder who they are?

 Really very good of her to lend her husband's--I was--
er--quite----

That'll do, Bertie.

Caught the doctor just starting, So lucky!

 Oh!  Thank goodness!

 How do, Lady Ella?  How do, Squire?--how do, Rector? How de do?  This the beastie?  I see.  Quite!  Who'll hold him
for me?

 Oh!  I!

 D'you know, I think I'd better.  It's so dreadful when it's
your own, isn't it?  Shall we go in here, doctor?  Come along, pretty
boy!

    

I dreaded it.  She is splendid!
