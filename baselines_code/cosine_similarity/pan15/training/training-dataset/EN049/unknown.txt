                           And say, "How clever!"
                           At whatsoever
                      She condescends to say!

	          Oh, 'tis a glorious thing, I ween,
                 To be a regular Royal Queen!
                 No half-and-half affair, I mean,
                 But a right-down regular Royal Queen!


       Now, pray, what is the cause of this remarkable hilarity?
            This sudden ebullition of unmitigated jollity?
       Has anybody blessed you with a sample of his charity?
            Or have you been adopted by a gentleman of quality?

	  Replying, we sing
                      As one individual,
                 As I find I'm a king,
                      To my kingdom I bid you all.
                 I'm aware you object
                      To pavilions and palaces,
                 But you'll find I respect
                      Your Republican fallacies.

	        As they know we object
                      To pavilions and palaces,
                 How can they respect
                      Our Republican fallacies?

                       

	          For every one who feels inclined,
                 Some post we undertake to find
                 Congenial with his frame of mind--
                      And all shall equal be.

	          The Chancellor in his peruke--
                 The Earl, the Marquis, and the Dook,
                 The Groom, the Butler, and the Cook--
                      They all shall equal be.

	          The Aristocrat who banks with Coutts--
                 The Aristocrat who hunts and shoots--
                 The Aristocrat who cleans our boots--
                      They all shall equal be!

	          The Noble Lord who rules the State--
                 The Noble Lord who cleans the plate--

	           The Noble Lord who scrubs the grate--
                      They all shall equal be!

	          The Lord High Bishop orthodox--
                 The Lord High Coachman on the box--

	          The Lord High Vagabond in the stocks--
                      They all shall equal be!
			For every one, etc.

                           Sing high, sing low,
                           Wherever they go,
                                They all shall equal be!

  CHORUS.                           Wherever they go,
                                They all shall equal be!

                 The Earl, the Marquis, and the Dook,
                 The Groom, the Butler, and the Cook,
                 The Aristocrat who banks with Coutts,
                 The Aristocrat who cleans the boots,
                 The Noble Lord who rules the State,
                 The Noble Lord who scrubs the grate,
                 The Lord High Bishop orthodox,
                 The Lord High Vagabond in the stocks--
