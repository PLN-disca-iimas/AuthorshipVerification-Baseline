I forget nothing, haughty lady. I love you desperately,
  my life is in your hand--I lay it at your feet! Give me hope, and what I
  lack in education and polite accomplishments, that I will endeavour to
  acquire. Drive me to despair, and in death alone I shall look for
  consolation. I am proud and cannot stoop to implore. I have spoken and I wait
  your word.

You shall not wait long. Your proffered love I haughtily reject.
  Go, sir, and learn to cast your eyes on some village maiden in
  your own poor rank--they should be lowered before your captain's daughter.

                        
                 Refrain, audacious tar,
                        Your suit from pressing,
                      Remember what you are,
                        And whom addressing!
              I'd laugh my rank to scorn
                        In union holy,
                      Were he more highly born
                        Or I more lowly!
              Proud lady, have your way,
                        Unfeeling beauty!
                      You speak and I obey,
                        It is my duty!
                      I am the lowliest tar
                        That sails the water,
                      And you, proud maiden, are
                        My captain's daughter!
            My heart with anguish torn
                        Bows down before her,
                      She laughs my love to scorn,
                        Yet I adore her!


			   Can I survive this overbearing
                        Or live a life of mad despairing,
                        My proffered love despised, rejected?
                        No, no, it's not to be expected!
                                (Calling off.)
                       Messmates, ahoy!
                           Come here! Come here!

                
                           Aye, aye, my boy,
                                What cheer, what cheer?
                                  Now tell us, pray,
                                  Without delay,
                                  What does she say--
                                What cheer, what cheer?

		The maiden treats my suit with scorn,
                            Rejects my humble gift, my lady;
			 She says I am ignobly born,
                            And cuts my hopes adrift, my lady.
                           Oh, cruel one.

 	            She spurns your suit? Oho! Oho!
                      I told you so, I told you so.


                      Shall { we } submit? Are { we } but slaves?
                             they               they
                        Love comes alike to high and low--
                      Britannia's sailors rule the waves,
                        And shall they stoop to insult? No!

     	        You must submit, you are but slaves;
                        A lady she! Oho! Oho!
                      You lowly toilers of the waves,
                        She spurns you all--I told you so!

  	           My friends, my leave of life I'm taking,
                      For oh, my heart, my heart is breaking.
                      When I am gone, oh, prithee tell
                      The maid that, as I died, I loved her well!
