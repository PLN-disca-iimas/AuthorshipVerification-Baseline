 Now sit right down there, Clarissa, and don't be moving a hair,
because you're all fixed and ready for the entertainment.

And how do I look, Nora?

Ye look like a Christmas angel, so you do. Your hair curled just
lovely and your striped stockings will be the admiration and envy of
the entire Sunday School.


Oh, Nora Eudora, come on quick. Teddy Magee fell in the
rain-barrel and it's drownded dead he is intirely. 

In the rain-barrel? How did he get in the rain-barrel?

Sure, I was washing him, I was. And he was that slippery with
the soap that he slid through me fingers and down to the bottom of the
barrel.

Oh, the poor little Teddy Magee. 

And how de yeez like me new sash, Peter Pan?

Scwumptious.

It's a tidy cover off'n a bureau, and I don't want to wear
it at all, at all. Folks'll be after thinking I'm a bureau. Don't it
look funny, Peter Pan?

Scwumptious.

I'm not going to wear it, so I'm not.


 Mary Ann Mulligan, and what are yeez trying to do with your
nice new sash?

 I ain't going to wear no tidy cover. Folks'll be after
thinking I'm a bureau.

Sure they'll think worse than that if yeez take it off.
That's what comes of yer growing so fast. Yer skirt is fer six years
old, and yer waist is fer six years old, and so you have to wear the
sash to help out the other two years. Sashes are awful stylish,
anyhow. It's pretty, too, ain't it, Peter Pan?

Scwumptious.

It's lucky for him that there wasn't any more water in
the rain-barrel, or he would have been drownded dead sure. Patsy, yeez
had no business to let him drop. Nora, you go out and finish him.
Where's Clarissa?

 Here I am, maw.

Well, you're all ready.
That's one. Nora and Patsy and Matsy are all ready. That makes four.
Mary Ann, are you all fixed?

 Yes, mum, but I don't like me sash at all, at all. Folks
will all know it's a bureau tidy, it's got fringe and everything.
