                 Skim milk masquerades as cream;
                 Highlows pass as patent leathers;
                 Jackdaws strut in peacock's feathers.

    		 Very true,
                     So they do.
    	         Black sheep dwell in every fold;
                 All that glitters is not gold;
                 Storks turn out to be but logs;
                   Bulls are but inflated frogs.

    		  So they be, Frequentlee.

             Drops the wind and stops the mill;
                 Turbot is ambitious brill;
                 Gild the farthing if you will,
                 Yet it is a farthing still.

   			 Yes, I know.
                     That is so.
                 Though to catch your drift I'm striving,
                   It is shady--it is shady;
                 I don't see at what you're driving,
                   Mystic lady--mystic lady.
    		     Stern conviction's o'er me stealing,
                 That the mystic lady's dealing
                 In oracular revealing.

  	 Stern conviction's o'er him stealing,
                 That the mystic lady's dealing
                 In oracular revealing.
                         Yes, I know--
                         That is so!


   	       Though I'm anything but clever,
                 I could talk like that for ever:
                 Once a cat was killed by care;
                 Only brave deserve the fair.
                         Very true,
                         So they do.

            Wink is often good as nod;
                 Spoils the child who spares the rod;
                 Thirsty lambs run foxy dangers;
                 Dogs are found in many mangers.

    	                Frequentlee,
