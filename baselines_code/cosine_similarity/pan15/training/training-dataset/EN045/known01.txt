Well, God bless
who's here! And how is the world treating you this afternoon,
Anna's father?

Pooty goot--if it ain't for some fallars.

Meaning me, do you? Well, if you
ain't the funny old crank of a man! Where's herself?
Where's Anna, I'm after asking you?

She go down end of dock.

I'll be going down to her, then. But first I'm thinking I'll
take this chance when we're alone to have a word with you. And that
word is soon said. I'm marrying your Anna before this day is out, and
you might as well make up your mind to it whether you like it or no.

Ho-ho! Dat's easy for say!

You mean I won't? Is it the like of yourself will
stop me, are you thinking?

Yes, Ay stop it, if it come to vorst.

God help you!

But ain't no need for me do dat. Anna--

Is it Anna you think will prevent me?

Yes.

And I'm telling you she'll not. She knows I'm loving her, and
she loves me the same, and I know it.

Ho-ho! She only have fun. She make big fool of you, dat's all!

That's a lie in your throat, divil mend
you!

No, it ain't lie. She tal me yust before she go out she never
marry fallar like you.

I'll not believe it. 'Tis a great old liar you are, and a divil
to be making a power of trouble if you had your way. But 'tis not
trouble I'm looking for, and me sitting down here.  Let us
be talking it out now as man to man. You're her father, and wouldn't it
be a shame for us to be at each other's throats like a pair of dogs,
and I married with Anna. So out with the truth, man alive. What is it
you're holding against me at all?
