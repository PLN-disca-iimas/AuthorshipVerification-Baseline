I don't care what he looks like. What kind is he?

Well, yuh can bet your life, kid, he's as good an
old guy as ever walked on two feet. That goes!

I'm glad to hear it. Then you think's he'll stake me
to that rest cure I'm after?

Surest thing you know. But
where'd yuh get the idea he was a janitor?

He wrote me he was himself.

Well, he was lyin'. He ain't. He's captain of a barge--five men
under him.

A barge? What kind of a barge?

Coal, mostly.

A coal barge! If that ain't a swell job to
find your long lost Old Man working at! Gee, I knew something'd be
bound to turn out wrong--always does with me. That puts my idea of his
giving me a rest on the bum.

What d'yuh mean?

I s'pose he lives on the boat, don't he?

Sure. What about it? Can't you live on it, too?

Me? On a dirty coal barge! What d'you think I am?

What d'yuh know about barges, huh? Bet yuh ain't
never seen one. That's what comes of his bringing yuh up inland--away
from the old devil sea--where yuh'd be safe--Gawd! 

His bringing me up! Is that what he tells people! I
like his nerve! He let them cousins of my Old Woman's keep me on their
farm and work me to death like a dog.

Well, he's got queer notions on some things. I've heard him say
a farm was the best place for a kid.

Sure. That's what he'd always answer back--and a lot of crazy
stuff about staying away from the sea--stuff I couldn't make head or
tail to. I thought he must be nutty.

He is on that one point. So yuh didn't fall for
life on the farm, huh?

I should say not! The old man of the family, his wife, and four
sons--I had to slave for all of 'em. I was only a poor relation, and
they treated me worse than they dare treat a hired girl.  It was one of the sons--the
youngest--started me--when I was sixteen. After that, I hated 'em so
I'd killed 'em all if I'd stayed. So I run away--to St. Paul.
