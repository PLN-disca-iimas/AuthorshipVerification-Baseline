                               
                   
                 And O my darling, O my pet,
                 Whatever else you may forget,
                 In yonder isle beyond the sea,
                 Do not forget you've married me!

	       Oh my darling, O my pet, etc.


                 Then away we go to an island fair
                      That lies in a Southern sea:
                 We know not where, and we don't much care,
                      Wherever that isle may be.

			One, two, three,
                                Haul!
                           One, two, three,
                                Haul!
                           One, two, three,
                                Haul!
                           With a will!

	      When the breezes are a-blowing
            The ship will be going,
                 When they don't we shall all stand still!
            Then away we go to an island fair,
            We know not where, and we don't much care,
                 Wherever that isle may be.

            

                      Away we go
                           To a balmy isle,
                      Where the roses blow
                           All the winter while.


                      Then away we go to an island fair
                           That lies in a Southern sea:
                      Then away we go to an island fair,
                           Then away, then away, then away!

            Of happiness the very pith
                           In Barataria you may see:
            A monarchy that's tempered with
                           Republican Equality.
            This form of government we find
            The beau ideal of its kind--
            A despotism strict combined
 		With absolute equality!

Two kings, of undue pride bereft,
                           Who act in perfect unity,
            Whom you can order right and left
                           With absolute impunity.
            Who put their subjects at their ease
            By doing all they can to please!
            And thus, to earn their bread-and-cheese,
                           Seize every opportunity.

Of happiness the very pith, etc.

Gentlemen, we are much obliged to you for your
  expressions of satisfaction and good feeling--I say, we are much
  obliged to you for your expressions of satisfaction and good
  feeling.

  We heard you.

We are delighted, at any time, to fall in with sentiments so charmingly expressed.

That's all right.

At the same time there is just one little grievance that we should like to ventilate.

 What?
