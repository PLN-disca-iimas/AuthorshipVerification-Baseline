Spoonbill Village, Northernmost Quang Binh Province, SRV.
June 30, 2011.
Considering their first encounter, this meeting was going rather well.
"No, no, I assure you that I have had quite enough… well, if you insist…" In the course of explaining his task to the household he would be staying in, Joseph Clayton had been offered tea at the behest of the mistress of the household and all three times, he had acquiesced. She was attending her husband in fine cotton clothes of white and black, the cut more resembling something out of Javanese dancing than anything worn in Indochina during the past thousand years. Their son, called from his lessons for the presentation, was sitting at the far end of the room, listening to what was going on. While he had repeated much the same spiel that Professor Andover to the house's three inhabitants, he had sipped at his bowl almost automatically as one would with water, clear onto what was now his fourth helping. Although not unpleasant, the drink had considerably more kick to it than even the strong brews typical of Vietnamese green tea.
What perplexed Joseph was that he couldn't identify the extra ingredient. It wasn't peppers, having no discernible remains or even the raw chemical heat of capsaicin. It could be ginger, but the heat was of an utterly different kind than any ginger he had ever experienced.
Then again, the additive could just as well be Tarantula venom given the figure he was giving his introduction to.
His name, as he had given it, was Noc. He was the most experience hunter, archer and scout of the village, was of an incredibly ancient lineage and, incidentally, was the first person of this strange, isolated village that he had seen. His tattoos all featured arachnid themes of legs, webbing and fangs and his eyes…
Marie had mentioned that some of the warriors practiced sorcery with mutative effects. If that was what caused Nocs eyes to become all black, seemingly all pupils and tempting Joseph to mentally refer to the man as "Spider Eye", then maybe those three weirdoes they caught in the biology labs back in February were onto something after all.
Sitting in the main reception area of the home, replete with decorations of strange latticed designs and black lacquer, Joseph watched carefully as Noc finished examining one of his bowstrings before his eyes darted around the room. On the wall, several bows hung in their unstrung state: the white and banded flatbow he had first witnessed, several simple bows of light colored cane and even one recurve bow made of dark red hardwood.
"So that is your request: to hear the stories of our history, to observe the operation of a household of status and to… take part in our activities?" Throughout the introduction of this man and the repetition he had given of the Professors offer, Noc had examined all aspects of him closely… and had not been impressed. He had some muscle tone, but everything else about him absolutely screamed that he was some sort of priest or urban scribe in training. Besides, the combination of the girl's cues toward him and his reaction to his tea made it clear: if the boy had been a virgin, steam would have been pouring out of his ears. That made things difficult (and potentially dangerous) for everyone.
Besides, very few people in this village held any affection at all for someone with Joseph's skin tone.
After receiving affirmation of Joseph's duties, Noc laid out the rules. "Know this: you will record the histories when they are told to you. You shall ask questions when you are allowed and you shall observe what you shall participate in what you are allowed to participate in. No pestering me with questions, no sneaking around trying to observe the women and children and no and I mean no trying to wheedle out information through trickery. We had quite enough trouble with that sort of thing the last time around."
Joseph was immediately insulted, even though he did not how it as he automatically agreed. Still, two things bothered him. First, underneath the gold and bronze bangles that decorated the forearms and ankles of Nocs wife, Joseph had noticed strange scars, akin in shape to the marks that sperm whales bore from their battles with giant squid.
Second… what did Noc mean by the last time around?
That Night…
As he lay awake, Joseph realized how exhausting the day had been. As it turned out, he was probably doing to spend most of his time in this house as a sort of a servant: documenting and participating in cooking and chores, handling domestic duties and picking little things up only as Noc's wife deemed appropriate. No real questions answered, no interesting discoveries or scandals or surprises… just ordinary ethnographic work.
It wasn't made any better that his libido was getting annoyed at the 'busy' signals it kept receiving. However, there had been no real opportunity to talk with Marie after last night, with all the revelations of cannibalism and sorcery and other things that probably should have made his stomach turn.
/Maybe it would be better if they had made your stomach turn./ Came a wheedling little multi-voiced dialogue from inside his head… from inside his head, but not originating from him.
Oh no. Joseph thought with a mental groan. Not you idiots again! I thought you gave it up after the last time.
/The last time? You mean when you were in the thrall of carnal lusts, disgracing your heritage?/ The dominant voice changed from one of the old WASP lords to that of an aristocratic dowager that had been ancient even when Granny Clara had been a girl. /Maybe now that you know what her kind get up to, you will listen to reason and find a girl more suitable to a young man of your station./
Her parents are just as middle class as mine are, thank you all very much. Joseph snarked back mentally, fully knowing how these… wraiths felt about his relationship with Marie and savoring the thought of causing them anguish.
/You know full well what is meant. What is not understood is why the other girl did not so arouse your… passions./
Oh please, her family is just as drenched in sorcery as these guys, it's just that they're more polite about who they slice open. Besides, I don't really think you'd have acted any differently if it had been Tracy I'd been with that night instead of Marie, inbred and rural as she apparently is. He remembered clearly that night: how these voices (who he was fairly sure were not the products of schizophrenia despite superficially similar symptomatology), had come to him in the midst of what should have been unimaginable passion and communion with his girlfriend (though with was much more awkward, rushed and possibly painful than desired). Even as the passion mounted, their insults became worse: the taunts, the archaic, hateful rhetoric, the most vicious slurs directed against Marie and him. And yet he had forged on, continuing despite the rising chorus of insane voices inside his head… or even because of them, for as they blasphemed against all that Marie was, all the little things that made Joseph love her all the more, he could tell that his defiance was causing them actual pain and torment… and even through the pleasures of the flesh, he took small, sadistic delights in causing pain and anguish to these assholes who claimed authority as his forbearers.
Now Joseph was getting annoyed… and cranky. Look, I don't have to listen to you idiots, even if you do claim to be my ancestors. You came from a completely different world whose rules do not apply to me. Also, the instruments of your authority are gone: no money, no status, no companies or contacts or friends in high places. All that's left are a bunch of ugly little voices in the wind. Why don't you all just blow away? He was tired of his, of having to listen to these inane snobs that he had learned to loath in the abstract and now hated in the concrete. He hated their hate-filled dismissals of all other peoples and cultures, their smug superiority and the generalized arrogance that seemed to drip from the voices.
When they didn't respond, Joseph took it as a sign. "Good." He said aloud, as softly as his sense of satisfaction allowed.
