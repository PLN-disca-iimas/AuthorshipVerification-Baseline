Phew!  What a gorgon!  I say, Rector, did you really
know a Challenger in the 'nineties?

No.

Ha!  Jolly good!

Well, you see!--it's all right.

Yes, indeed.  A great relief!

I must go in now.

 Hold on!  You goin' to ask 'em to--to--anything?

Yes.

I shouldn't.

 Why not?  We all like the look of her.

 I think we should punish ourselves for entertaining that
uncharitable thought.

Yes.  It's horrible not having the courage to take people
as they are.

As they are?  H'm!  How can you till you know?

Trust our instincts, of course.

And supposing she'd turned out not married--eh!

 She'd still be herself, wouldn't she?

 Ella!

H'm!  Don't know about that.

 Of course she would, Tommy.

 Well!  It's a great weight off my----!

There's the poor darling snuffling.  I must go in.

 Precious!

     

How perfectly sweet of you to make him that!

He's such a dear.  And the other poor dog?

Quite safe, thanks to your strop.

Oh!  There, he's broken it.  Bertie!

Let me!  

We're really most tremendously obliged to you.  Afraid
we've been an awful nuisance.

Not a bit.  I love dogs.

Hope to make the acquaintance of Mr----of your husband.

Gently, darling!  Tommy, take him.

Is he behaving?

    
 Oh!  yes--he's a love.

Bertie, take Hannibal.


 I can't be too grateful for all you've done for my poor darling.  This is where we live.  Do come--
and see----

    
That is--I'm--I----

   
I don't know if your husband shoots, but if------er--he--does--er--er----

Look!

Hannibal! 

Don't squeeze him, Bertie!

That dog'll be
forgettin' himself in a minute.

  You mustn't think, I----You mustn't think, we
----Oh!  I must just see they--don't let Edward get at Hannibal.

What is the matter with them?



You left this, m'm, in the bathroom.

Oh! I hadn't missed it.  Thank you, Martha.

Ah!
