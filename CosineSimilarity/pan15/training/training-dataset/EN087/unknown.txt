God blast it!

No, your kind never realises things till the crash
comes--usually when it's too late. She kept on doing her work, I
suppose--taking care of her brothers and sisters, washing, cooking,
sweeping, looking after your comfort--worn out--when she should have
been in bed--and---- But what's the use of talking? The damage is done. We've got to set to work
to repair it at once. I'll write to-night to Dr. Stanton of the Hill
Farm Sanatorium and find out if he has a vacancy. And if luck is with
us we can send her there at once. The sooner the better.

Is it sendin' Eileen away
to a hospital you'd be? Then you'll not! You'll get that
notion out of your head damn quick. It's all nonsense you're stuffin'
me with, and lies, makin' things out to be the worst in the world. I'll
not believe a word of Eileen having the consumption at all. It's
doctors' notions to be always lookin' for a sickness that'd kill you.
She'll not move a step out of here, and I say so, and I'm her father!

 You refuse to let your daughter go to a sanatorium?

I do.

Then I'll have to report her case to the
Society for the Prevention of Tuberculosis of this county, and tell
them of your refusal to help her.

Report all you like, and be damned to you!

A majority of the
most influential men of this city are behind the Society. Do you know
that? We'll find a way to move you, Carmody, if you try to
be stubborn.

Ara, Doctor,you don't see the way of it at all. If Eileen goes to the hospital,
who's to be takin' care of the others, and mindin' the house when I'm
off to work?

You can easily hire some woman.

Hire? D'you think I'm a millionaire itself?

That's where the shoe pinches, eh? I'm not going to waste any more words on you, Carmody, but I'm
damn well going to see this thing through! You might as well give in
first as last.

But where's the money comin' from?
