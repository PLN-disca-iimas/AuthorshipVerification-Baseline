I'll do my best, Doctor. (_As if he couldn't
yet believe his ears--shuddering!_) Good heavens! She never said a word
about--being so ill. She's had a cold. But, Doctor--do you think this
sanatorium will----?

Most certainly. She has every
chance. The Hill Farm has a really surprising record of arrested
cases--as good as any place in the country. Of course, she'll never be
able to live as carelessly as before, even after the most favourable
results. She'll have to take care of herself. I'm
telling you all this as being the one most intimately concerned. I
don't count Carmody. You are the one who will have to assume
responsibility for her welfare when she returns to everyday life.

Yes--certainly. Where is this sanatorium, Doctor--very far away?

Half an hour by train to the town. The sanatorium is two miles
out on the hills--a nice drive. You'll be able to see her whenever
you've a day off. It's a pleasant trip.

You said--Eileen ought to be sent away--for the sake of those
around her----?

That's obvious. T.B. is extremely contagious, you must know
that. Yet I'll bet she's been fondling and kissing those brothers and
sisters of hers regardless. And look at this house sealed tight against the fresh air! Not a window
open an inch! That's what we're up against in the fight
with T.B.--a total ignorance of the commonest methods of prevention----

Then the kids might have gotten it--by kissing Eileen?

It stands to reason that's a common means of communication.

Yes. I suppose it must be. But that's
terrible, isn't it? I'll promise you, Doctor, I'll tell Carmody straight what's
what. He'll pay attention to me or I'll know the reason why.

Good boy! You've probably saved me a disagreeable squabble. I won't wait for
Carmody. The sight of him makes me lose my temper. Tell him I'll be
back to-morrow with definite information about the sanatorium.

All right, Doctor.
