Oh, ho, me fine young lady. I suppose yeez want a
peek-a-boo dress all trimmed with mayonnaise ruffles down the bias, do
you? It's lucky for you I found that tidy in the wash, so it is. And
don't yeez eat too much or breathe hard or ye'll bust it, and then
where'll you be at?

Maw, Mary Ann's chewing her apron.

Mary Ann Mulligan, take that apron
out'n your mouth. I niver saw such a girl to be always chewing
something. It's first yer dress and then yer apron or your petticoat,
whatever happens to be your topmost garment. Clothes were not made to
chew.


Here they are, maw, all ready for the party.

Are ye sure they're all clean?

I am that. They've been scrubbed until me two arms ache. And
Micky's had a bath in the rain-barrel.

I have that, and I don't want another one, either.

All yeez sit down and let me look ye over.

Have ye finished the washing, maw?

For the prisint, yes. I have more important duties to
perform. Now, first and foremost, don't walk pigeon-toed. Bridget,
have ye got a clane handkerchief?

Yis, mum.

Well, don't forget to use it if the necessity arises,
and you'd better set next to Peter Pan so's he can use it, too. He's
been kinder nosey all day, and I shouldn't wonder if he wasn't coming
down with a cold in his head. How do you feel, Peter Pan?

Scwumptious.

Micky Machree Mulligan, and what are yeez looking
cross-eyed for? Do ye think it improves yer beauty?

I thought there was a speck of dirt on me nose.

Well, there's not, and hold yer head up straight.

Maw, ain't it most time to go?

 It lacks two hours yet of the time, and Matsy ain't
come back with the goat. Whatever's become of Shamus O'Brien I'd like
to know. Which of yeez seen him last?

I saw him this mornin'. He was eatin' a tin tomato can down in
the alley.

The poor thing! Now I suppose I'll have a sick goat on
me hands on top of all me other troubles--and tomorrow's Christmas
Day.
