Gimme a shock. Number Two.

Here's luck! 

Give us another.

Gimme a scoop this time--lager and porter. I'm dry.

Same here. 

Hello, boss.

Hello, Larry. Just on time.

Let's drink up and get back to it.

Addressed care of you, Johnny. Know him?

Christopher Christopherson.

Square-head name.

Old Chris--that's who.

Oh, sure. I was forgetting Chris carried a hell of a name like
that. Letters come here for him sometimes before, I remember now. Long
time ago, though.

It'll get him all right then?

Sure thing. He comes here whenever he's in port.

Sailor, eh?

Captain of a coal barge.

Some job! Well, s'long.

S'long. I'll see he gets it. You got good eyes, Larry. Where's it from?

St. Paul. That'll be in Minnesota, I'm thinkin'. Looks like a woman's writing, too, the old divil!

He's got a daughter somewheres out West, I think he told me
once.  Come to think of it, I
ain't seen old Chris in a dog's age.  Guess I'll be gettin' home. See you
to-morrow.

Good-night to ye, boss. 

Hello, Yohnny! Have drink on me. Come on, Larry. Give us drink.

A sport, Chris is. Well, I'll beat it home. S'long.
