And if I get in my baby buggy, I'll bweak it all down.

And my mamma won't recognize me at all, 'cause I'm grown so
big.

That's all very well, but it will be quite a job to make
you all little again. It will take three magic fern seeds, and I
don't think I have any ripe yet.

 Oh, what is it, Mr. Wishing Man? Is it the fern seed?

 Yes, but it's only one fern seed. Only one of you can be made little again.

Give it to my sister, Tootsy. She's a girl.

No, give it to Dumpling. He's the oldest.

I think I'll give it to 'ittie Snookie Ookums. Here,
Snookums, take that little seed and go down by the pump and get a
drink of water. Put the seed in the water and swallow it and you'll be
the original 'ittie Snookums again.

Oh, goody, goody, goody!

 Here's another fern seed. Ladies first, Dumpling. I'll
give it to Tootsy.

Oh, you dear, good Wishing Man. I'll give you a nice hug and
kiss for that. 
 And here's the third magical fern seed. Here you are,
Master Dumpling. Hurry along and grow little again.

Oh, thank you, sir.

 The dolly plants don't seem
to be doing very well. Here's a ripe one. I'm going
to give that to  for a Christmas
present. And here's another for ----. I wonder how my big French dolls
are doing. They're dreadfully hard to raise. They require so much
attention. I have to keep them under cover to protect them from the
sun. The wax melts so easily and the pretty red cheeks are apt to run
down over their pretty French dresses. How nice
they look. There's Annette, Olivette and Babette. Three as pretty
little French ladies as ever came out of Paris. I think they're just
about ready to pick. They're such pretty dollies that I think I'll
give them to little boys instead of little girls. I'll give Annette to
and I'll give Olivette to ----, and
little Babette I'll give to ----.
