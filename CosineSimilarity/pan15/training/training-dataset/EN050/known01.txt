  Mr Foreson?

Sir?

We'll do that lighting again.

 
Mr Foreson!Mr Foreson.

For goodness sake, stand by!  We'll do that lighting again. Check your floats.

Electrics!

Hallo!

Give it us again.  Check your floats.

Great Scott!  What the blazes!  Mr Foreson!


Mr Foreson!

Sir?

Tell Miller to come down.

Electrics!  Mr Blewitt Vane wants to speak to you.  Come down!

Tell Herbert to sit in that chair.


Mr Foreson!

Sir?

Don't go off the stage. 

Yes, Mr Vane?

Look!

That's what I'd got marked, Mr Vane.

Once for all, what I want is the orchard in full moonlight,
and the room dark except for the reading lamp.  Cut off your front
battens.

Mr Foreson!

Sir?

See this marked right.  Now, come on with it!  I want to get
some beauty into this!

Here you are, then, Mr Vane.  Herbert, sit in that chair.

Now! Great Scott!

Mr Foreson.

Sir?

Look--at--that--shade!

On his face, on his face!

Is that what you want, Mr Vane?

Yes.  Now, mark that!

Electrics!

 Hallo!

Mark that!

My God!

Mr Foreson.

  Sir?

Ask him if he's got that?

Have you got that?

Yes.

Now pass to the change.  Take your floats off altogether.

Floats out.

Cut off that lamp. Put a little amber in
your back batten.  Mark that!  Now pass to the end.  Mr Foreson!

Sir?

Black out

Black out!

Give us your first lighting-lamp on.  And then the two
changes.  Quick as you can.   Put some pep into it.  Mr Foreson!

Sir?

Stand for me where Miss Hellgrove comes in.

Good!  Leave it at that.  We'll begin.  Mr Foreson, send up to Mr
Frust.

  Herb!  Call the boss, and tell beginners to stand by.
Sharp, now!

Mr Foreson.

Sir?

I want "Props."

"Props!"

Is that boulder firm?

If, you don't put too much weight on it, sir.

It won't creak?

Nao.

Make that right.  Let me see that lute.

The Boss, Sir.

That'll do, then.
