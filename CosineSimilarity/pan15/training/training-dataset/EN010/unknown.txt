Oh, come on, quick, Dumpling, before he changes his mind.

It's a very foolish wish, but maybe they'll be satisfied if I make them the biggest children on earth.
I'll see what I can do.

 I'm standing up on the table now.



     Hickety, kickety, setting sun,
       
     Thunder, lightning, flash of a gun!
     Let him grow bigger, it won't be much fun;
     Hickety, kickety, number one!

Now it's my turn. I'm on the table.



     Witchery, twitchery, kangaroo,
     Thunder and lightning, Kalamazoo!
     Lengthen her, strengthen her, rip, bazoo,
     Make her a giantess, number two!

 Now, Mr. Wishing Man, I'm on the table.

That's the Baby Snookums. Very well, little Snookie
Ookums! I'll change you into the biggest baby on earth.

     Rumpety, thumpety, Kankakee,
     Lengthen him out to six foot three!
     The biggest baby we ever did see,
     Rumpety, thumpety, number three!


Goodness, gracious! Is it a tornado or an earthquake?
Oh! And who are you? Murder!
Thieves! Robbers! Where's me children? Where's little Dumpling and
Tootsy and Baby Snookums?

Where are your children?

They join hands and dance around at 

There they are. There are little Dumpling and Tootsy and Baby Snookums.

 Hello, little boys and girls, how do you do this fine
winter night? I know what each of you has been thinking. You've been
wishing that _you_ could meet the Wishing Man and that he would make
your wishes come true. Now, haven't you? Well, I've made that wish
come true. You wished to meet me, and here I am. I've been watching
you all the year in Sunday School. I know how you have worked over
your lessons, how you have helped your teachers and how punctual you
have been. To be sure, I know some of you haven't helped your teachers
as much as you could have done, but I'll forget all that at Christmas
time. Now tell me what you wish for most.
