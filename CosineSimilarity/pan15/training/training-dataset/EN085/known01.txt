What's eating you, anyway? Don't you want no one to be nice to me
except yourself?

Yes, Ay do, Anna--only not
fallar on sea. But Ay like for you marry steady fallar got good yob on
land. You have little home in country all your own--

Oh, cut it out! 
Little home in the country! I wish you could have seen the little home
in the country where you had me in jail till I was sixteen! Some day you're going to get me so mad with that
talk, I'm going to turn loose on you and tell you--a lot of things
that'll open your eyes.

Ay don't vant--

I know you don't; but you keep on talking yust the same.

Ay don't talk no more den, Anna.

Then promise me you'll cut out saying nasty things about Mat
Burke every chance you get.

Vhy? You like dat fallar--very much,
Anna?

Yes, I certainly do! He's a regular man, no matter what faults
he's got. One of his fingers is worth all the hundreds of men I met out
there--inland.

Maybe you tank you love him, den?

What of it if I do?

Maybe--you tank you--marry
him?

No! If I'd met him four
years ago--or even two years ago--I'd have jumped at the chance, I tell
you that straight. And I would now--only he's such a simple guy--a big
kid--and I ain't got the heart to fool him.
But don't never say again he ain't good enough for me. It's me ain't
good enough for him.

Py yiminy, you go crazy, Ay tank!

Well, I been thinking I was myself the
last few days. Guess I'll take a walk down to the
end of the dock for a minute and see what's doing. I love to watch the
ships passing. Mat'll be along before long, I guess. Tell him where I
am, will you?

All right, Ay tal him.
