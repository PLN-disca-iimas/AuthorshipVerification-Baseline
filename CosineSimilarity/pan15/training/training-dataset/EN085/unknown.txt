Aye, it's the punishment o' God on him. Did ye ever hear of
a man who wasn't crazy do the things he does? Who but a man that's mad would take his woman--and as sweet a
woman as ever was--on a rotten whalin' ship to the Arctic seas to be
locked in by the ice for nigh on a year, and maybe lose her senses
forever--for it's sure she'll never be the same again.

She useter be awful nice to me before--she got--like she is.

Aye, she was good to all of us. 'Twould have been hell on
board without her; for he's a hard man--a hard, hard man--a driver if
there ever was one. I hope he's satisfied
now--drivin' her on till she's near lost her mind. And who could blame
her? 'Tis a God's wonder we're not a ship full of crazed people--with
the ice all the time, and the quiet so thick you're afraid to hear your
own voice.

She don't
never speak to me no more--jest looks at me 's if she didn't know me.

She don't know no one--but him. She talks to him--when she
does talk--right enough.

She does nothin' all day long now but sit and sew--and then she
cries to herself without makin' no noise. I've seen her.

Aye, I could hear her through the door a while back.

She's cryin' now.

God send his soul to hell
for the devil he is!

'Twould
be like hitting a worm. It is nigh on two bells, Mr. Steward, and this
truck not cleared yet.

Y-y-yes, sir.
