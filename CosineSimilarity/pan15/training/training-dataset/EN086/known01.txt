We do!

There!

Well, Dick, we wouldn't go for to hurt any fellow creature's
  feelings, but you can't expect a chap with such a name as Dick
  Deadeye to be a popular character--now can you?

No.

It's asking too much, ain't it?

It is. From such a face and form as mine the noblest sentiments
  sound like the black utterances of a depraved imagination It is
  human
  nature--I am resigned.


        But, tell me--who's the youth whose faltering feet
            With difficulty bear him on his course?

That is the smartest lad in all the fleet--Ralph Rackstraw!

Ha! That name! Remorse! remorse!
 				The Nightingale
                        Sighed for the moon's bright ray
                          And told his tale
                        In his own melodious way!
                        He sang "Ah, well-a-day!"

                      He sang "Ah, well-a-day!"
                          The lowly vale
                        For the mountain vainly sighed,
                          To his humble wail
                        The echoing hills replied.
                          They sang "Ah, well-a-day!"

                       They sang "Ah, well-a-day!"

  I know the value of a kindly chorus,
       But choruses yield little consolation
         When we have pain and sorrow too before us!
         I love--and love, alas, above my station!

 He loves--and loves a lass above his station!

Yes, yes, the lass is much above his station!

                                             

                        A maiden fair to see,
                        The pearl of minstrelsy,
                          A bud of blushing beauty;
                        For whom proud nobles sigh,
                        And with each other vie
                          To do her menial's duty.
                      To do her menial's duty.

                        A suitor, lowly born,
                        With hopeless passion torn,
                          And poor beyond denying,
                        Has dared for her to pine
                        At whose exalted shrine
                          A world of wealth is sighing.
                    	 A world of wealth is sighing.

                        Unlearned he in aught
                        Save that which love has taught
                          (For love had been his tutor);
                        Oh, pity, pity me--
                        Our captain's daughter she,
                          And I that lowly suitor!
  	                  And he that lowly suitor!

    Ah, my poor lad, you've climbed too high: our worthy
  captain's child won't have nothin' to say to a poor chap like you. Will
  she, lads?

    No, no.
