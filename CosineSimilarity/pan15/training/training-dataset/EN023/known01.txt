No, no, captains' daughters don't marry foremast hands.

 Shame! shame!

Dick Deadeye, them sentiments o' yourn are a disgrace to our
 common natur'.

But it's a strange anomaly, that the daughter of a man who hails
  from the quarter-deck may not love another who lays out on the
  fore-yard arm. For a man is but a man, whether he hoists his flag at the
  main-truck or his slacks on the main-deck.

Ah, it's a queer world!

Dick Deadeye, I have no desire to press hardly on you, but such
  a revolutionary sentiment is enough to make an honest sailor
  shudder.

My lads, our gallant captain has come on deck; let us
  greet him as so brave an officer and so gallant a seaman deserves.


  	          My gallant crew, good morning.
           Sir, good morning!

            I hope you're all quite well.

        Quite well; and you, sir?

           I am in reasonable health, and happy To meet you all once more.

     You do us proud, sir!

                             

                I am the Captain of the Pinafore;
                  And a right good captain, tool
                             You're very, very good,
                             And be it understood,
                           I command a right good crew,

                	 We're very, very good,
                             And be it understood,
                           He commands a right good crew.

   	                  Though related to a peer,
                           I can hand, reef, and steer,
                             And ship a selvagee;
                           I am never known to quail
                           At the furry of a gale,
                             And I'm never, never sick at sea!

                            What, never?

                             No, never!

                            What, never?

                             Hardly ever!

    	              He's hardly ever sick at seal
                      Then give three cheers, and one cheer more,
                      For the hardy Captain of the Pinafore!

                      I do my best to satisfy you all--

                    And with you we're quite content.

                     You're exceedingly polite,
			And I think it only right
                           To return the compliment.

    	                     We're exceedingly polite,
                             And he thinks it's only right
                           To return the compliment.

    	                    Bad language or abuse,
                             I never, never use,
                           Whatever the emergency;
                             Though "Bother it" I may
                             Occasionally say,
                           I never use a big, big D--

                           What, never?

                               No, never!

                           What, never?

                                Hardly ever!

   	             Hardly ever swears a big, big D--
                      Then give three cheers, and one cheer more,
                      For the well-bred Captain of the Pinafore!
