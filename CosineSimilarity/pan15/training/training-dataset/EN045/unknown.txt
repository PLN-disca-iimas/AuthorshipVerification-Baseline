Sure, he has. Who do you think takes care of the reindeer,
and who waters the doll-tree and picks the dolls?

Picks the dolls? Do the dolls grow on trees?

Yes, indeed, right next door to the taffy cottage, down
Chocolate Lane. I take care of the marble bushes and the popgun trees.
You just ought to see our wonderful gardens.

Oh, I'd love to see them.

We've got a Teddy-bear garden, and a tool garden, and a

furniture garden, and a game garden, and a candy garden, though most
of the candy comes from mines.

The mines?

Sure. We dig out just the kind we want. We have caramel
mines, and vanilla mines and mines full of chocolate almonds, and
rivers of fig paste and strawberry ice cream soda. They flow right
through the picture-book garden.

Oh, it must be the most wonderful place in the whole world.

And I help take care of it. I have fourteen little
brothers, and we're all twins.

And have you a mother, too? Has Santa Claus a nice-a, fine-a
wife?

Of course he's got a wife. Haven't you ever
heard of my mother. Her name is Mary.

Mary? Mary what?

Why, Merry Mary Christmas, of course. I thought everyone
knew that.

 And does she go round the world with Santa Claus on the night
before Christmas?

Oh, no, she's too busy for that. She stays at home and
takes care of the gardens.

 But what are you doing here on the ship? I should think you'd
be with your father.

Ah, that is a secret. You mustn't tell anyone.

How can I tell anyone when I don't know myself.

Well, maybe I'll tell you.
