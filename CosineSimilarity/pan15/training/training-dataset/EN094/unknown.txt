I say; what's the matter?  You were crying when I spoke
to you.

Oh!  nothing.  The beautiful evening-that's all.

Cheer up!

Cheer up!  You are not lonelee, like me.

I say, how did you how did you get into this?  Isn't it an awfully hopeless sort of
life?

Yees, it ees.  You haf been wounded?

Just out of hospital to-day.

The horrible war--all the misery is because of the war.  When
will it end?

 I say, what nationality are you?

Rooshian.

 Really!  I never met a Russian girl. I say, is it as bad as they make out?

 Not when I haf anyone as ni-ice as you; I never haf had, though. You stopped because I was
sad, others stop because I am gay.  I am not fond of men at all.
When you know--you are not fond of them.

Well, you hardly know them at their best, do you?  You
should see them in the trenches.  By George!  They're simply
splendid--officers and men, every blessed soul.  There's never been
anything like it--just one long bit of jolly fine self-sacrifice;
it's perfectly amazing.

 I expect you are not the last at that.  You see in them what you haf in yourself, I think.

  Oh, not a bit; you're quite out!  I assure you when we
made the attack where I got wounded there wasn't a single man in my
regiment who wasn't an absolute hero.  The way they went in--never
thinking of themselves--it was simply ripping.

It is the same too, perhaps, with--the enemy.

Oh, yes!  I know that.

Ah!  You are not a mean man.  How I hate mean men!

Oh! they're not mean really--they simply don't understand.

Oh!  You are a babee--a good babee aren't you?

   
But I li-ke you for it.  It is so good to find a ni-ice man.

About being lonely?  Haven't you any Russian friends?

Rooshian?  No. The town is so beeg. Were you at the concert before you spoke to me?

Yes.

I too.  I lofe music.

I suppose all Russians do.

I go there always when I haf the money.

What!  Are you as badly on the rocks as that?
