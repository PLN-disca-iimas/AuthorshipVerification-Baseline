Oh, for heaven's sake, are you off on that
again? Where's the harm in his taking me around? D'you want me to sit
all day and night in this cabin with you--and knit? Ain't I got a right
to have as good a time as I can?

It ain't right kind of fun--not with that fallar, no.

I been back on board every night by eleven, ain't I? 
Say, look here, what d'you mean by what you yust said?

Nutting but what Ay say, Anna.

You said "ain't right" and you said it funny. Say, listen here,
you ain't trying to insinuate that there's something wrong between us,
are you?

No, Anna! No, Ay svear to God, Ay never tank dat!


Well, don't you never think it neither if you want me ever to speak to
you again. If I ever dreamt you thought that, I'd get
the hell out of this barge so quick you couldn't see me for dust.

Ay wouldn't never dream-- You vas gatting learn to svear. Dat ain't nice for
young gel, you tank?

Excuse me. You ain't used to
such language, I know. That's what your taking me to sea
has done for me.

No, it ain't me. It's dat damn sailor fallar
learn you bad tangs.

He ain't a sailor. He's a stoker.

Dat vas million times vorse, Ay tal you! Dem fallars
dat vork below shoveling coal vas de dirtiest, rough gang of no-good
fallars in vorld!

I'd hate to hear you say that to Mat.

Oh, Ay tal him same tang. You don't gat it in head Ay'm scared
of him yust 'cause he vas stronger'n Ay vas. You don't
gat for fight with fists with dem fallars. Dere's oder vay for fix him.

What d'you mean?

Nutting.

You'd better not. I wouldn't start no trouble with him if I was
you. He might forget some time that you was old and my father--and then
you'd be out of luck.

Vell, yust let him! Ay'm ole bird
maybe, but Ay bet Ay show him trick or two.

Aw come on, be good. What's eating you, anyway? Don't you want no one to be nice to me
except yourself?
