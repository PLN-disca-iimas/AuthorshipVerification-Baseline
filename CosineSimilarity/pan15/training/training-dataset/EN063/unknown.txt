From what he told me, I should say it
was the only thing for Eileen to do if she wants to get well quickly.
 And I'd certainly not go against Gaynor, if I was you.
He told me he'd make it hot for you if you did. He will, too, you can
bet on that. He's that kind.

He's a divil. But what can he do--him and his
Sasiety? I'm her father.

Oh, he'll do what he says, don't worry! You'll make a
mistake if you think he's bluffing. It'd probably get in all the papers
about you refusing. Every one would be down on you. You might even lose your job over it, people would
be so sore.

Ah, divil take him! Let him send her
where he wants, then. I'll not be sayin' a word.

And, honestly, Mr. Carmody, I don't
see how you can object for a second--after he's told you it's
absolutely necessary for Eileen to go away. (_Seeing_ Carmody's _shaken
condition, he finishes boldly._) You've some feeling for your own
daughter, haven't you? You'd be a fine father if you hadn't!

Whisht! She might hear you. But you're
right. Let her do what she's wishful to, _and_ get well soon.

That's the right spirit. I knew you'd see it that way. And you and I'll
do all we can to help her. Well, I guess I'll
have to go. Tell Eileen----

You're not goin'? Sure, Eileen is puttin' on her clothes to
come down and have a look at you. She'll be here in a jiffy. Sit down
now, and wait for her.

No--no--I can't stay--I only came for a moment--I've got an
appointment--honestly. Besides, it isn't right for her to be up. She's
too weak. It'll make her worse. You should have told her.

 Good evening, Fred. 

Hello, Eileen. I'm so sorry to---- You must sit down. You've got to take care of yourself. You
never ought to have got up to-night.
