And you must not forget the leetla Dutch twins, and my cousin
Tomasso, and Hulda and Meeny and Sergius and Ah Goo and Sano San and
Needla and Biddy Mary and Paddy Mike and all the rest.

Whew! That's a big order. But we won't forget a single
soul on Christmas Day. And now I've got to go and put the finishing
touches on--you know what!

Why, he's gone.

 The sun has set,
it's out of sight, so little Jack Frost will say good-night!
itself if it was-a not nailed to the deck. Hurry, Anita!

 I goIt's a
awful good-a secret, Tomasso.

 Ah, the great, grand-a lady moon. She looks
at me, I look at her. Maybe she'll like a leetla serenade.

 Sure, that's beautiful. It takes me back again to dear
ould Ireland where the River Shannon flows.

 What do you do in Ireland the night before Christmas, Biddy
Mary?

 Do you have a Christmas tree like we do in Germany?

 We do not. We don't have any tree at all, at all.

And we don't get many presents. But it's a fine time we
have for all that. Instead of getting presents, we have the fun of
giving presents--and that's the finest thing in all the world, so it
is, to make the other fellow happy. Sure, I just love to give
presents.

You can give me some if you want to.

Und me also some.

But where would we be getting presents out here in the
middle of the ocean? In dear ould Ireland sure it's a fine time we're
after having on Christmas Day.

 It is that. With the fiddles playing and the dancers
dancing and the fine suppers upon the table.

In Russia we always set a table in front of the window and
put a fine linen cloth on it. 
Here is the cloth, but we have no window.

 Here, use this box as a table. Now, let us put the cloth on, so!
