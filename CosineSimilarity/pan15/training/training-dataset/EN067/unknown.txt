My, I wisht I was a great, great, great big girl.

There, that's a wish that money can't buy.

Grandpa said he'd get us anything we wished for.

What do you wish, Snookums?

Wish Grandpaw would come home.

I know a real good wish. I wish it were Christmas every day.
Don't you, Dumpling?

 No, I don't. We'd have to have a present and a tree and a
turkey and plum pudding every day of our lives. We'd get awfully tired
of it after a while. Just think, we'd have to give away about a
million presents every year.

I'll tell you what I really do wish.

What?

I wish we could do just like grown up folks do. I wish I was
the biggest little girl in all the world.

And I wish so, too. I wish we were just awfully, awfully,
awfully big--and then we could go to Aunt Clara's dinner party, and
everywhere.

Me wish me was great big Snookums.

But money couldn't buy that wish, Dumpling.

No, that's right. But Grandpa said if he couldn't buy our
wish he'd get it some other way.

How could he get it?

He said he'd tell the Wishing Man.

 My, I wonder if there really is such a person!

I don't know. But I'd like to see him if there is.

I'll make a rhyme.

     Good Mr. Wishing Man, how do you do?
     If there is such a person, we'd like to see you!



     If you come from afar, if you come from near,
     Good Mr. Wishing Man, appear, appear!
 Well?

 Well? Well!

 Well?

 Well, I'm here.

Who's here?

Why, I am here. You said you would like to see me and
so I have come. I'm here.

 Are you the Wishing Man?

That's my name. 

     I'm the friend of all the children,
       And I'll help you if I can,
