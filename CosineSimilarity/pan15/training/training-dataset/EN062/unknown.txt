Jim, you won't go fightin' in the sun, with the birds all callin'?

That depends on 'im.  I'm not lookin' for it.  Daisy, I
love you.  I love your hair.  I love your eyes.  I love you.

And I love you, Jim.  I don't want nothin' more than you
in all the world.

Amen to that, my dear.  Kiss me close!

                   "I'll be right there to-night,
                    Where the fields are snowy white;
                    Banjos ringing, darkies singing,
                    All the world seems bright."

It's him!


Don't get the wind up, Daisy.  I'm here!

Daisy!  Daisy!  Hallo, old pretty girl!

Hallo, Jack! I got things to tell you!

 What sort o' things, this lovely day?  Why, I got things
that'd take me years to tell.  Have you missed me, Daisy?

You been so long.

So I 'ave.  My Gawd!  It's a way they 'ave in the Army.  I
said when I got out of it I'd laugh.  Like as the sun itself I used
to think of you, Daisy, when the trumps was comin' over, and the wind
was up.  D'you remember that last night in the wood?  "Come back and
marry me quick, Jack."  Well, here I am--got me pass to heaven.  No
more fightin', no more drillin', no more sleepin' rough.  We can get
married now, Daisy.  We can live soft an' 'appy.  Give us a kiss, my
dear.

No.

Why not?

 That's why, soldier.

'Oo are you, Pompey?  The sun
don't shine in your inside, do it?  'Oo is he, Daisy?

 I'll fight you for her.

 Mate, you done your bit, an' I done mine.  It's
took us two ways, seemin'ly.

Jim!

I don't want 'is charity.  I only want what I can take.

Daisy, which of us will you 'ave?

Oh!  Him!


You see, mate!  Put your 'ands down.  There's nothin' for
it but a laugh.  You an' me know that.  Laugh, mate!

You blarsted----!

It's no use, mate.  I can't do it.  I said I'd laugh
to-day, and laugh I will.  I've come through that, an' all the stink
of it; I've come through sorrer.  Never again!  Cheerio, mate!  The
sun's a-shinin'!  He turns away.

Jack, don't think too 'ard of me!

No fear, my dear!  Enjoy your fancy!  So long!  Gawd bless you both!

'E's mad!

The sun has touched 'im, Jim!
