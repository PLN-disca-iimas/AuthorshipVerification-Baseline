Don't, Mat! For Gawd's sake! Get out of here! Leave me alone!
Get out of here!

I'll be going, surely! And I'll
be drinking sloos of whiskey will wash that black kiss of yours off my
lips; and I'll be getting dead rotten drunk so I'll not remember if
'twas iver born you was at all; and I'll be shipping away on some boat
will take me to the other end of the world where I'll never see your
face again!

No, you don't go. Ay tank maybe it's better Anna
marry you now.

Lave go of me, ye old ape! Marry
her, is it? I'd see her roasting in hell first! I'm shipping away out
of this, I'm telling you! And my curse
on you and the curse of Almighty God and all the Saints! You've
destroyed me this day and may you lie awake in the long nights,
tormented with thoughts of Mat Burke and the great wrong you've done
him!

Mat! 

Ay tank Ay go ashore, too.

Not after him! Let him go! Don't you dare--

Ay go for gat drink.

So I'm driving you to drink, too, eh? I
s'pose you want to get drunk so's you can forget--like him?

Yes, Ay vant! You tank Ay like hear dem
tangs. Ay tank you vasn't dat kind of gel,
Anna.

And I s'pose you want me to beat it, don't you? You
don't want me here disgracing you, I s'pose?

No, you stay here! Ain't your fault, Anna, Ay know dat. It's dat ole davil,
sea, do this to me! It's her dirty
tricks! It vas all right on barge with yust you and me. Den she bring
dat Irish fallar in fog, she make you like him, she make you fight with
me all time! If dat Irish fallar don't never come, you don't never tal
me dem tangs, Ay don't never know, and every tang's all right. Dirty ole davil!

Oh, what's the use? Go on ashore and get
drunk.

You vait here, Anna?

Maybe--and maybe not. Maybe I'll get drunk, too. Maybe
I'll--But what the hell do you care what I do? Go on and beat it.
