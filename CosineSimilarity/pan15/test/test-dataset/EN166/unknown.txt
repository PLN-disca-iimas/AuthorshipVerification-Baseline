     Of the child that is born, O Baltasar,
       I begged a woman to tell us the news;
     I said in the east we had seen His star,
     And had ridden fast and had ridden far
       To find and worship the King of the Jews.

     Brothers, our quest is ended; see the star
     Is standing still over this lowly hut.

     Methinks it is a stable. Knock and see!

     What ho, within!

     Sirs, whom seek ye?


     We have journeyed from afar
     Led by the shining of yon splendid star.
     We are Gaspar, Melchoir and Baltasar.


     We seek a new-born King,
     Gold, frankincense to him we bring.
     And many a kingly offering.

     Behold, the child is clothed in light!


     Our journey ends, passed is the night.


     Now let us make no more delay,
     But worship Him right worthily.


     Hail, hail, dear child
     Of a maiden meek and mild.
       See, he merries!
     See, he smiles, my sweeting,
     I give thee greeting!
         Have a bob of cherries.


     Hail, little One we've sought,
     See, a bird I've brought,
         See its feathers gay.
     Hail, little One adored,
     Hail, blessed King and Lord,
         Star of the day!


     Hail, little One, so dear,
     My heart is full of cheer,
         A little ball I bring,
     Reach forth thy fingers gay,
     And take the ball and play,
         My blessed King.
  I bring Thee a crown, O King of Kings,
     And here a scepter full of gems,
     For Thou shalt rule the hearts of men.



     For Thee I bring sweet frankincense!


     And I bring myrrh to offer Thee!



     The greatest gift is yet ungiven,
     The gift that cometh straight from Heaven.
         O, Heavenly King,
         Heart's love we bring.


     Not gold nor gems from land or sea
     Is worth the love we offer Thee.


     And lowly folk who have no gold,
     Nor gift to offer that is meet,
     May bring the dearest thing of all--
     A loving heart and service sweet.
