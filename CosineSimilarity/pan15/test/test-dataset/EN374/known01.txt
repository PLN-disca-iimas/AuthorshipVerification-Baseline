Tomorrow comes the great, grand
festival of Christmas, is it not, Paddy Mike?

Sure and it is. This is
the holy Christmas Eve.

The night of the day
behind Christmas is always Christmas Eve, ain't it?
Sure it is.

Und tomorrow we gets lots of Christmas presents always, me
und Klinker; don't we, Klinker?

Sure we do. Leedle horses and pictures und candy und other
things also; don't we, Schwillie Willie Winkum?

That was when we were at home in Holland. It's different,
maybe, out here in this great big boat. Ven we get by the city of New
York next week then maybe we'll get some presents already.

But good Saint Nicholas always comes the night before
Christmas; don't he, Schwillie Willie Winkum?

Sure. Won't he come tonight, Hulda?

How could he get way out here on the ocean already? Do you
think he is a fish? We ain't living at home in Holland no more. We're
way out on the Atlantic Ocean in a great big ship.

Ja, und I wish I was back at home already. So much have I been
seasick, mit der ship going oop und down, oop und down! Ach, it's
awful.

 But Saint Nicholas ought to come tonight, Hulda. I been a
awfully good boy, isn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?

Sure you is. Und I've been a awfully good boy, too. Isn't
I, Klinker?

Sure. We've been awfully good boys.

Maybe even if Saint Nicholas don't come tonight, you can see
the great, big whale tomorrow. If he's a good whale he'll surely let
the leedle Dutch twins see him on Christmas Day.

Oh, I vant to see der whale. I've looked und I've looked und
I've looked, but I ain't even so much as seen his leedle tail yet
already. Und it makes me seasick to look so much, too.

Are ye sure it was a whale ye saw that day, Sergius boy?
