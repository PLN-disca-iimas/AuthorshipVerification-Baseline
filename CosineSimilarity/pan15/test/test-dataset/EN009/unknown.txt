How is his lordship now?

A little easier, sir.

Crichton, send Fisher to me.

I have no pity for you girls, I--

Ernest, go away, and don't insult the broken-hearted.

And uncommon glad I am to go. Ta-ta, all of you. He asked me to
say a few words. I came here to say a few words, and I'm not at all sure
that I couldn't bring an action against him.

My poor sisters, come here. We must make this draw
us closer together. I shall do my best to help you in every way. Just
now I cannot think of myself at all.

But how unlike you, Mary.

It is my duty to protect my sisters.

I never knew her so sweet before, Agatha. (Cautiously.) What
do you propose to do, Mary?

I propose when we are on the yacht to lend Fisher to you when
I don't need her myself.

Fisher?

Of course, as the
eldest, I have decided that it is my maid we shall take with us.

Mary, you toad.

Nothing on earth would induce Fisher to lift her hand for either
me or Catherine.

I was afraid of it, Agatha. That is why I am so sorry for
you.

Fisher, you heard what his lordship said?

Yes, my lady.

You have given me some satisfaction of late, Fisher, and to mark my approval
I have decided that you shall be the maid who accompanies us.

I thank you, my lady.

That is all; you may go.

If you please, my lady, I wish to give notice.

Oh, certainly--you may go.

But why, Fisher?

I could not undertake, my lady, to wait upon three. We don't do
it. Oh, my lady, to think that
this affront--

I thought I told you to go, Fisher.

Serves you right.

It will be Simmons after all. Send Simmons to me.

My lady, might I venture to speak?

What is it?

I happen to know, your ladyship, that Simmons desires to give
notice for the same reason as Fisher.

Oh!

Then, Catherine, we take Jeanne.

And Jeanne also, my lady.

We can't blame them. Could any maid who respected herself be got
to wait upon three?

I suppose there are such persons,
Crichton?

I have heard, my lady, that there are such.

Crichton, what's to be done? We sail in
two days; could one be discovered in the time?

Surely you can think of some one?

There is in this establishment, your
ladyship, a young woman--

Yes?

A young woman, on whom I have for some time cast an eye.

Do you mean as a possible lady's-maid?

I had thought of her, my lady, in another connection.

Ah!

But I believe she is quite the young person you require.
Perhaps if you could see her, my lady--

I shall certainly see her. Bring her to me. You
two needn't wait.

Needn't we? We see your little game, Mary.

We shall certainly remain and have our two-thirds of her.

This, my lady, is the young person.

Oh dear!

Come here, girl. Don't be afraid.

Her appearance, my lady, is homely, and her manners, as you
may have observed, deplorable, but she has a heart of gold.

What is your position downstairs?

I'm a tweeny, your ladyship.

A what?

A tweeny; that is to say, my lady, she is not at present,
strictly speaking, anything; a between maid; she helps the vegetable
maid. It is she, my lady, who conveys the dishes from the one end of
the kitchen table, where they are placed by the cook, to the other end,
where they enter into the charge of Thomas and John.

I see. And you and Crichton are--ah--keeping company?

A butler don't keep company, my lady.

Does he not?

No, your ladyship, we butlers may--(he makes a gesture with
his arms)--but we do not keep company.

I know what it is; you are engaged?
