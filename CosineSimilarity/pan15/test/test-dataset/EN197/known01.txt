Hurry, Jack, and fill up the shoes and stockings.

Yes, daddy, I'm hurrying.

It's just two minutes till Christmas morning. I've had a
hard night's work and I think I'll just take a little vacation here in
the steerage.

Oh, Santa Claus, may I wake up all the leetla children and let
them see you?

Yes, just as soon as you hear the chimes announcing the
birth of Christmas Day.

 And don't you have any other place to go this year?

I hope not. Here I am in the middle of the ocean and my air ship is just about played out. Jack, dump everything out of the
sack and we'll give the little immigrants the jolliest kind of a
Christmas. I'm not going to lug all of those toys and candy and things
back to the North Pole again.

Here they are, daddy.

Now, where's the tree?

 There she is. Isn't she a beauty?

 Oh, it's the greatest, most grand-a tree in all the world.

There are the chimes. It is Christmas Day. Merry
Christmas, daddy; merry Christmas, Anita. Christmas Day is here.

Merry Christmas, Jack Frost! Merry
Christmas, Santa Claus! Merry Christmas, everybody! Merry Christmas to
all the world. Wake up, Hulda! Wake up!

Wake up, Paddy Mike and Sergius! Wake up! Merry Christmas!

 Wake up, Meeny and Biddy. It's Christmas morning. And you
two little shavers, Klinker and Schwillie Willie Winkum, wake up and
give Santa Claus a good, old hug!



 Oh, he's come, he's come, he's come!

Me, too.I said he'd come, didn't I, Klinker?

 Sure you did. And me, too, didn't I, Schwillie Willie Winkum?

Oh, see the tree! The beautiful, beautiful Christmas tree.

And my leetla shoes are full of candy and toys.

Now, let's be all after giving three cheers for old Santa
Claus.

And this is the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.

Then three cheers for the leetla Jolly Jack Frost.
