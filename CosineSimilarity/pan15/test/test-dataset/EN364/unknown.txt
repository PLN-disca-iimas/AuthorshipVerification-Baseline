 
 I'll take off anything else in reason.

But a Royal Salute to my daughter--it costs so little.

 Papa, I don't want a salute.

My dear sir, as soon as we know which of us is entitled to take that liberty she shall have as man salutes as she likes.

 As for guards of honour and triumphal arches, you
  don't know our people--they wouldn't stand it.

They are very off-hand with us--very off-hand indeed.

Oh, but you mustn't allow that--you must keep them in
  proper discipline, you must impress your Court with your
  importance.  You want deportment--carriage--

 We've got a carriage.

  Manner--dignity.  There must be a good deal of this
  sort of thing- and a little of this sort of
  thing- and possibly just a Soupcon of this sort of
  thing!- and so on.  Oh, it's very useful, and most
  effective.  Just attend to me.  You are a King--I am a subject.
  Very good--

      I am a courtier grave and serious
                      Who is about to kiss your hand:
                 Try to combine a pose imperious
                      With a demeanour nobly bland.

     Let us combine a pose imperious With a demeanour nobly bland.

  That's, if anything, too unbending--
                      Too aggressively stiff and grand;

                 Now to the other extreme you're tending--
                 Don't be so deucedly condescending!

      Now to the other extreme you're tending--Don't be so dreadfully condescending!

      Oh, hard to please some noblemen seem! At first, if anything, too unbending;
                 Off we go to the other extreme--
                      Too confoundedly condescending!

         Now a gavotte perform sedately--
                      Offer your hand with conscious pride;
                 Take an attitude not too stately,
                      Still sufficiently dignified.

      Now for an attitude not too stately, Still sufficiently dignified.
