If we did, my lady, the first thing we should do would be to
elect a head. Circumstances might alter cases; the same person might
not be master; the same persons might not be servants. I can't say as to
that, nor should we have the deciding of it. Nature would decide for us.

You seem to have thought it all out carefully, Crichton.

Yes, my lady.

And you have done this for us, Crichton, because you thought
that--that father needed to be kept in his place?

I should prefer you to say, my lady, that I have done it for
the house.

Thank you, Crichton. Mary, be nicer to him. (But LADY MARY has
begun to read again.) If there was any way in which we could show our
gratitude.

If I might venture, my lady, would you kindly show it by
becoming more like Lady Mary. That disdain is what we like from
our superiors. Even so do we, the upper servants, disdain the lower
servants, while they take it out of the odds and ends.

Oh dear, what a tiring day.

I feel dead. Tuck in your feet, you selfish thing.

I wonder what he meant by circumstances might alter cases.

Don't talk, Mary, I was nearly asleep.

I wonder what he meant by the same person might not be
master, and the same persons might not be servants.

Do be quiet, Mary, and leave it to nature; he said nature
would decide.

I wonder--
This is what I have written. 'Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on an
island in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev.
This is what I have written. 'Wrecked, wrecked, wrecked! on an
island in the Tropics, the following: the Hon. Ernest Woolley, the Rev.

John Treherne, the Ladies Mary, Catherine, and Agatha Lasenby, with two
servants. We are the sole survivors of Lord Loam's steam yacht Bluebell,
which encountered a fearful gale in these seas, and soon became a total
wreck. The crew behaved gallantly, putting us all into the first boat.
What became of them I cannot tell, but we, after dreadful sufferings,
and insufficiently clad, in whatever garments we could lay hold of in
the dark'--

Please don't describe our garments.

--'succeeded in reaching this island, with the loss of only one
of our party, namely, Lord Loam, who flung away his life in a gallant
attempt to save a servant who had fallen overboard.' (The ladies have
wept long and sore for their father, but there is something in this last
utterance that makes them look up.)

But, Ernest, it was Crichton who jumped overboard trying to save
father.

Well, you know, it was rather silly of uncle to fling away his life by
trying to get into the boat first; and as this document may be printed
in the English papers, it struck me, an English peer, you know--

Ernest, that is very thoughtful of you.

--'By night the cries of wild cats and
the hissing of snakes terrify us extremely'--(this does not satisfy
him so well, and he makes a correction)--'terrify the ladies extremely.
Against these we have no weapons except one cutlass and a hatchet. A
bucket washed ashore is at present our only comfortable seat'--

And Ernest is sitting on it.

H'sh! Oh, do be quiet.--'To add to our horrors, night falls
suddenly in these parts, and it is then that savage animals begin to
prowl and roar.'

Have you said that vampire bats suck the blood from our toes
as we sleep?

No, that's all. I end up, 'Rescue us or we perish. Rich reward.
Signed Ernest Woolley, in command of our little party.' This is written
on a leaf taken out of a book of poems that Crichton found in his
pocket. Fancy Crichton being a reader of poetry. Now I shall put it into
the bottle and fling it into the sea.

The tide is going out, we mustn't miss the post.

Anything wrong, sir?
