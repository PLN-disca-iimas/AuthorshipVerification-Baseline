I perceive, from the tea cups, Crichton, that the great function is to take place here.

Yes, sir.

The servants' hall coming up to have tea in the drawing-room! No wonder you look happy, Crichton.

No, sir.

Do you know, Crichton, I think that with an effort you might look even happier. You don't approve of his lordship's compelling his servants to be his equals--once a month?

It is not for me, sir, to disapprove of his lordship's radical views.

Certainly not. And, after all, it is only once a month that he is affable to you.

On all other days of the month, sir, his lordship's treatment of us is everything that could be desired.
Tea cups! Life, Crichton, is like a cup of tea; the more heartily we drink, the sooner we reach the dregs.

Thank you, sir.

as we do when we have need of an ally). Crichton, in case I should be asked to say a few words to the servants, I have strung together a little speech. I was wondering where I should stand.

with the best intentions, gives him a footstool to stand on, and departs, happily unconscious that ERNEST in some dudgeon has kicked the footstool across the room.)

Suppose you were all little fishes at the bottom of the sea

And how are my little friends to-day?

Don't be silly, Ernest. If you want to know how we are, we are dead. Even to think of entertaining the servants is so exhausting.

Besides which, we have had to
decide what frocks to take with us on the yacht, and that is such a
mental strain.

You poor over-worked things. Rest your weary limbs.

But why have you a footstool in your
hand?

Yes?

Why? You see, as the servants are to be the guests I must be butler. I
was practising. This is a tray, observe.

Tea, my lady?
It is only you, Ernest; I thought there
was some one here.

Had a very tiring
day also, Mary?

Dreadfully. Been trying on engagement-rings all the
morning.

What's
that? Is it Brocklehurst?

You have given your warm young heart to Brocky?

I don't wish to fatigue you, Mary, by insisting on a verbal answer, but
if, without straining yourself, you can signify Yes or No, won't you
make the effort?

The ring! Then I am too late, too late! (Fixing LADY MARY sternly, like
a prosecuting counsel.) May I ask, Mary, does Brocky know? Of course,
it was that terrible mother of his who pulled this through. Mother does
everything for Brocky. Still, in the eyes of the law you will be,
not her wife, but his, and, therefore, I hold that Brocky ought to be
informed. Now--

If you girls are shamming sleep in the expectation that I shall awaken
you in the manner beloved of ladies, abandon all such hopes.

You impertinent boy.

I knew that was it, though I don't know everything. Agatha, I'm not young enough to
know everything.

Young enough?

Don't you see? I'm not young enough to know
