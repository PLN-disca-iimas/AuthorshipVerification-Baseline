It's proud and happy you'ld be if I was getting my death the day I
was shut of yourself. Let you walk out throughthat door, I'm telling you, and let you not be passing this way if it's hungry you are, or wanting a bed.

Maybe himself would take her.

What would he do with me now?

Give you the half of a dry bed, and good food in your mouth.

Is it a fool you think him, stranger, or is it a fool you were born
yourself? Let her walk out of that door, and let you go along with
her, stranger--if it's raining itself--for it's too much talk you have
surely.

We'll be going now, lady of the house--the
rain is falling, but the air is kind and maybe it'll be a grand morning
by the grace of God.

What good is a grand morning when I'm destroyed surely, and I going
out to get my death walking the roads?

You'll not be getting your death with myself, lady of the house,
and I knowing all the ways a man can put food in his mouth.... We'll be
going now, I'm telling you, and the time you'll be feeling the cold,
and the frost, and the great rain, and the sun again, and the south wind
blowing in the glens, you'll not be sitting up on a wet ditch, the way
you're after sitting in the place, making yourself old with looking
on each day, and it passing you by. You'll be saying one time, "It's
a grand evening, by the grace of God," and another time, "It's a wild
night, God help us, but it'll pass surely." You'll be saying--

Go out of that door, I'm telling you, and do your blathering below in the glen.
