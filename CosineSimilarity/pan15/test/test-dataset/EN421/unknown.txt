Is it getting the curse on me you'ld be, woman of the house? I
wouldn't lay my hand on him for the Lough Nahanagan and it filled with
gold.

Maybe cold would be no sign of
death with the like of him, for he was always cold, every day since I
knew him,--and every night, stranger; but I'm thinking it's dead he is surely, for he's
complaining a while back of a pain in his heart, and this morning, the
time he was going off to Brittas for three days or four, he was taken
with a sharp turn. Then he went into his bed and he was saying it was
destroyed he was, the time the shadow was going up through the glen, and
when the sun set on the bog beyond he made a great lep, and let a great
cry out of him, and stiffened himself out the like of a dead sheep.

God rest his soul.

Maybe that would do you better than the milk of the sweetest cow in County Wicklow.

The Almighty God reward you, and may it be to your good health.

I've no pipes saving his own, stranger, but they're sweet pipes to smoke.

Thank you kindly, lady of the house.

Sit down now, stranger, and be taking your rest.

I've walked a great way through the world, lady of the house, and seen great wonders, but I
never seen a wake till this day with fine spirits, and good tobacco, and
the best of pipes, and no one to taste them but a woman only.

Didn't you hear me say it was only after dying on me he was when
the sun went down, and how would I go out into the glen and tell the
neighbours, and I a lone woman with no house near me?

There's no offence, lady of the house?

No offence in life, stranger. How would the like of you, passing
in the dark night, know the lonesome way I was with no house near me at
all?
