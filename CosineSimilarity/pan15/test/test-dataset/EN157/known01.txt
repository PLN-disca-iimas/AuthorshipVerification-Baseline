Yes, ma'am, right here on the boat.

Oh, show me.

 I will. But it's part of the secret. Come here and I'll show you what I've been doing.

It isn't anything scary, is it?

Of course not.  There; what do you think of that?

 Oh, oh! oh!! It's too great and grand and wonderful for words.
Oh, what a wonderful, wonderful secret! I'm so glad you've told me. It
is so much nicer to know all about it beforehand. I wish I could tell
Tomasso.

 Well, you can't. It's a secret and you mustn't tell
anybody.

 But are you really, truly sure he's coming?

 Of course he is. That is our secret.

Oh, it's the grandest secret I ever had in all-a my life. I
will not tell a soul that he is-a coming. It will be a Christmas
surprise, and when I get to the beeg city of New York in America, I'll
always remember this great-a beeg, nice-a secret about old Santa Claus
and his nice leetla boy, Jack Frost.

What are you going to do when you get to America?

I am going to dance. My uncle, Pedro Spanilli, he haba de
grind-organ. Until last-a month he had-a de nice-a monkey, named Mr.
Jocko, but last-a month Mr. Jocko he die, and my uncle, Pedro
Spanilli, he send for me to take-a his place.

Take the monkey's place?

Yes, sir. I'm going to go round with my uncle and hold out my
tambourine, so! And then I will-a
collect the pennies, just like-a Mr. Jocko used to do.

JI suppose you are going to wear a leetla
red cap and jump up and down this way and say,
"Give-a de monk de cent!"

Oh, no. I'm going to sing the leetla song, and
dance the leetla dance, so!  Then, when I'm finished, I go to
the kind leetla boy, Jack Frost, and hold out my tambourine, so!
 And maybe he drops a nickel in my tambourine. Eh? Does
he?

Yes, I guess he does. And you just wait till tomorrow morning, Anita, and I'll give
you the finest Christmas present on the Atlantic Ocean.
