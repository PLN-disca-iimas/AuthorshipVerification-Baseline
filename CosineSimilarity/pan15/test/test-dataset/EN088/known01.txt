you walking into my big, empty halls.  I've
made all sure to have you, and yet all said
there's a fear in the back of my mind I'd miss
you and have great troubles in the end.  It's
for that, Deirdre, I'm praying that you'll
come quickly; and you may take the word of
a man has no lies, you'll not find, with any
other, the like of what I'm bringing you in
wildness and confusion in my own mind.

I cannot go, Conchubor.

It is my pleasure to have you, and I
a man is waiting a long while on the throne
of Ulster.  Wouldn't you liefer be my com-
rade, growing up the like of Emer and Maeve,
than to be in this place and you a child always?

You don't know me and
you'd have little joy taking me, Conchubor.
. . .  I'm a long while watching the days
getting a great speed passing me by.  I'm too
long taking my will, and it's that way I'll be
living always.

Call Fergus to
come with me.  This is your last night upon
Slieve Fuadh.

Leave me a short space longer, Conchubor.  Isn't it a
poor thing I should be hastened away, when
all these troubles are foretold?  Leave me a
year, Conchubor; it isn't much I'm asking.

It's much to have me
two score and two weeks waiting for your
voice in Emain, and you in this place growing
lonesome and shy.  I'm a ripe man and in
great love, and yet, Deirdre, I'm the King of
Ulster. I'll call Fergus, and
we'll make Emain ready in the morning.

Do not call him, Conchubor. . . .  Promise me a year
of quiet. . . .  It's one year I'm asking only.

You'd be asking a year
next year, and the years that follow.  Fergus!  Fergus!
Young girls are slow always; it is their lovers
that must say the word.  Fergus!There is a storm coming, and we'd best be going to our
people when the night is young.

The gods shield you, Deirdre. We're late
already, and it's no work the High King to
be slipping on stepping-stones and hilly path-
ways when the floods are rising with the rain.

glad that he has made
his decision  -- Keep your
rules a few days longer, and you'll be brought
down to Emain, you and Deirdre with you.

Your rules are kept always.

The gods shield you.

Wasn't I saying you'd do it?  You've brought your marriage a sight
nearer not heeding those are wiser than yourself.

It wasn't I did it.  Will you take me from this place,
Lavarcham, and keep me safe in the hills?

He'd have us tracked in
the half of a day, and then you'd be his queen
in spite of you, and I and mine would be
destroyed for ever.

Are there none can go against Conchubor?

Maeve of Connaught only, and those that are her like.

Would Fergus go against him?

He would, maybe, and his temper roused.
Would Naisi and his brothers?

Let you not be dwelling on Naisi and his brothers. . . .
In the end of all there is none can go against
Conchubor, and it's folly that we're talking,
for if any went against Conchubor it's sorrow
he'd earn and the shortening of his day of life.

Are the stepping-stones flooding, Lavarcham?  Will the night be stormy in
the hills?

looking at her curiously. The stepping-stones are flooding, surely, and
the night will be the worst, I'm thinking, we've
seen these years gone by.

Lay these mats and hangings by the windows, and at the
tables for our feet, and take out the skillets
of silver, and the golden cups we have, and
our two flasks of wine.

What ails you?

Lay them out quickly, Lavarcham, we've no call
dawdling this night.  Lay them out quickly;
I'm going into the room to put on the rich
dresses and jewels have been sent from Emain.

Putting on dresses at
this hour, and it dark and drenching with the
weight of rain!  Are you away in your head?

I will dress like Emer in Dundealgan, or Maeve in
her house in Connaught.  If Conchubor'll
make me a queen, I'll have the right of a queen
who is a master, taking her own choice and
making a stir to the edges of the seas. . . .
Lay out your mats and hangings where I can
stand this night and look about me.  Lay out
the skins of the rams of Connaught and of the
goats of the west.  I will not be a child or
plaything; I'll put on my robes that are the
richest, for I will not be brought down to
Emain as Cuchulain brings his horse to the
yoke, or Conall Cearneach puts his shield
upon his arm; and maybe from this day I will
turn the men of Ireland like a wind blowing
on the heath.
