Noddin', nid, nid noddin'.

Dropping off to sleep, ain't we, Klinker?

 Asleep! Every last one of them is verra sound asleep. Meeny and
Biddy Mary, and Sergius and Tomasso and the leetla Dutch twins and
all! Jack Frost! Jolly Jack Frost! Come-a
quick, come-a quick! They're all asleep.

Hello, what is it?

It is Anita. The leetla children are all here and sound asleep.

And so was I. They sang a song
about noddin', nid, nid noddin', and I just went to sleep myself. I
dreamed I was hunting a polar bear way up by the North Pole.
I'm still awfully sleepy.

 I didn't know that you ever went to sleep.

 You bet I do. That's the one thing I've got against my
daddy's Christmas trip every year. It wakes us all up right in the
middle of the night.

The middle of the night? What _do_ you mean?

Middle of the north pole night. If it wasn't for Christmas
we could go to bed about half past October and sleep until a quarter
of May, but ma thinks we ought to help pa and then wait up until he
comes home. My, I'm sleepy! Aren't you?

Oh, no, no! I'm verra too much excited to sleep. It's all about
my secret. Are you really sure he is coming?

 Of course he is, and it's almost time he was here now.
It's nearly Christmas Day. Look way up there in the sky. You don't see
anything that looks like an air ship, do you?

 No, I cannot see a single thing.

 Oh, look here! The children have
lighted a candle for him. That's just fine. It always pleases him. And
see; here's a picture and a wreath of holly and the star of Bethlehem.
And stockings and shoes all in a row.

 I can't see a thing.

Here's a telescope. Look through that. Now do you see anything?

 Oh, no; now I cannot even see the stars or the moon.

Of course you can't. You are looking through the wrong
end. Turn it around.

Oh, now I can see the stars. And, oh, look! I see a leetla, teeny-weeny thing way, way
off--far up in the sky. Look, Jack Frost, is that the air ship?

 Yes, I believe it is.
