Certainly not, my lady. The utmost I can say at present is
that I have cast a favourable eye.

As you choose. But I am afraid, Crichton, she will not suit
us.

My lady, beneath this simple exterior are concealed a very
sweet nature and rare womanly gifts.

Unfortunately, that is not what we want.

And it is she, my lady, who dresses the hair of the
ladies'-maids for our evening meals.

She dresses Fisher's hair?

Yes, my lady, and I does them up when they goes to parties.

Does!

Doos. And it's me what alters your gowns to fit them.

What alters!

Which alters.

Mary?

I shall certainly have her.

We shall certainly have her. Tweeny, we have decided to make
a lady's-maid of you.

Oh lawks!

We are doing this for you so that your position socially may be
more nearly akin to that of Crichton.

It will undoubtedly increase the young person's
chances.

Then if I get a good character for you from Mrs. Perkins, she
will make the necessary arrangements.

My lady!

By the way, I hope you are a good sailor.

You don't mean, my lady, I'm to go on the ship?

Certainly.
But-- You ain't going, sir?

No.

Then neither ain't I.

YOU must.

Leave him! Not me.

Girl, don't be silly. Crichton will be--considered in your
wages.

I ain't going.

I feared this, my lady.

Nothing'll budge me.

Leave the room.

Crichton, I think you might have shown more displeasure with
her.

I was touched, my lady. I see, my lady, that to
part from her would be a wrench to me, though I could not well say so in
her presence, not having yet decided how far I shall go with her.

The ingrate! The smug! The fop!

What is it now, father?

That man of mine, Rolleston, refuses to accompany us because
you are to have but one maid.

Hurrah!

Darling father, rather than you should lose
Rolleston, we will consent to take all the three of them.

Pooh, nonsense! Crichton, find me a valet who can do without
three maids.

Yes, my lord. In the time--the more suitable the
party, my lord, the less willing will he be to come without the--the
usual perquisites.

Any one will do.

My lord!

The ingrate! The puppy!

I ask a favour of a servant?--never!

Then I will. Crichton, would it not be very distressing to you
to let his lordship go, attended by a valet who might prove unworthy? It
is only for three months; don't you think that you--you yourself--you--

I beg your pardon.

But think of the joy to Tweeny.

Crichton, do you think it safe to
let the master you love go so far away without you while he has these
dangerous views about equality?

My lord, I have found a man.

Already? Who is he?

Yourself?

Father, how good of him.

Uncommon good. Thank you, Crichton. This helps me nicely out of a hole; and how it will annoy
Rolleston! Come with me, and we shall tell him. Not that I think you
have lowered yourself in any way. Come along.

My lady--a valet's hand!

I had no idea you would feel it so deeply; why did you do it?

Crichton, I am curious. I insist upon an
answer.

My lady, I am the son of a butler and a lady's-maid--perhaps
the happiest of all combinations, and to me the most beautiful thing in
the world is a haughty, aristocratic English house, with every one kept
in his place. Though I were equal to your ladyship, where would be the
pleasure to me? It would be counterbalanced by the pain of feeling that
Thomas and John were equal to me.

But father says if we were to return to nature--
