Naisi and his
brothers are well pleased with this place; and
what would take them back to Conchubor in
Ulster?

Their like would go any place where they'd see death standing.  I'm in dread Conchubor
wants to have yourself and to kill Naisi, and
that that'll be the ruin of the Sons of Usna.
I'm silly, maybe, to be dreading the like, but
those have a great love for yourself have a
right to be in dread always.

Emain should be no safe place for myself and Naisi.
And isn't it a hard thing they'll leave us no
peace, Lavarcham, and we so quiet in the
woods?

It's a hard thing, surely; but let you take my word
and swear Naisi, by the earth, and the sun
over it, and the four quarters of the moon, he'll
not go back to Emain -- for good faith or bad
faith -- the time Conchubor's keeping the high
throne of Ireland. . . .  It's that would save
you, surely.

There's little power in oaths to stop what's coming, and
little power in what I'd do, Lavarcham, to
change the story of Conchubor and Naisi and
the things old men foretold.

Was there little power in what you did the night
you dressed in your finery and ran Naisi off
along with you, in spite of Conchubor and the
big nobles did dread the blackness of your
luck?  It was power enough you had that
night to bring distress and anguish; and now
I'm pointing you a way to save Naisi, you'll
not stir stick or straw to aid me.

Let you not raise your voice against me, Lavarcham,
if you have will itself to guard Naisi.

Naisi is it?  I didn't care if the crows were
stripping his thigh-bones at the dawn of day.
It's to stop your own despair and wailing, and
you waking up in a cold bed, without the man
you have your heart on, I am raging now.
Yet there is more
men than Naisi in it; and maybe I was a big
fool thinking his dangers, and this day, would
fill you up with dread.Let you end; such
talking is a fool's only, when it's well you know
if a thing harmed Naisi it isn't I would live
after him.  It's well you
know it's this day I'm dreading seven years,
and I fine nights watching the heifers walking
to the haggard with long shadows on the
grass; or the time I've been
stretched in the sunshine, when I've heard
Ainnle and Ardan stepping lightly, and they
saying: Was there ever the like of Deirdre for
a happy and sleepy queen?

And yet you'll go, and welcome is it, if Naisi
chooses?

I've dread going or staying,
Lavarcham.  It's lonesome this place, having
happiness like ours, till I'm asking each day
will this day match yesterday, and will to-
morrow take a good place beside the same day
in the year that's gone, and wondering all
times is it a game worth playing, living on
until you're dried and old, and our joy is gone
for ever.

If it's that ails you, I
tell you there's little hurt getting old, though
young girls and poets do be storming at the
shapes of age.  There's little
hurt getting old, saving when you're looking
back, the way I'm looking this day, and seeing
the young you have a love for breaking up
their hearts with folly.  
Take my word and stop Naisi, and the day'll
come you'll have more joy having the senses
of an old woman and you with your little
grandsons shrieking round you, than I'd have
this night putting on the red mouth and the
white arms you have, to go walking lonesome
byways with a gamey king.

It's little joy of a young
woman, or an old woman, I'll have from this
day, surely.  But what use is in our talking
when there's Naisi on the foreshore, and
Fergus with him?

I'm late so with my warnings, for Fergus'd talk the
moon over to take a new path in the sky.
You'll not stop him this
day, and isn't it a strange story you were a
plague and torment, since you were that
height, to those did hang their lifetimes on
your voice.  Don't think bad of
my crying.  I'm not the like of many and I'd
see a score of naked corpses and not heed
them at all, but I'm destroyed seeing yourself
in your hour of joy when the end is coming
surely.

Fergus's men are calling you.  You were seen on the path,
and he and Naisi want you for their talk below.

Yourself's an ill-lucky thing to meet a
morning is the like of this.  Yet if you are a
spy itself I'll go and give my word that's
wanting surely.              

So I've found you alone, and I after waiting three weeks getting
ague and asthma in the chill of the bogs, till
I saw Naisi caught with Fergus.

I've heard news of Fergus;
what brought you from Ulster?

The full moon, I'm thinking, and it squeezing the crack in my
skull.  Was there ever a man crossed nine
waves after a fool's wife and he not away in
his head?

It should be a long time since you left Emain, where there's
civility in speech with queens.

It's a long while, surely.  It's
three weeks I am losing my manners beside
the Saxon bull-frogs at the head of the bog.
Three weeks is a long space, and yet you're
seven years spancelled with Naisi and the pair.
