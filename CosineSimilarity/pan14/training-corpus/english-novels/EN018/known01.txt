Hanoi, Socialist Republic of Vietnam
June 24, 2011.
"Hey, we're here. Get up if you don't want to wake up in Hue!"
Joseph Clayton was shaken awake by the hand of one of his classmates on his shoulder. He was sitting in the back of a taxi van... the only one left sitting, actually, as the others had already disembarked to enter the government office they were parked in front of.
Which probably meant that he was left to pay the fare.
After he payed (as seemed to be his lot on this trip), he followed his classmates and his professor into the government office where they hoped to finally receive their travel permits. He hadn't gotten much of sleep on the plane; a mixture of excitement in the face of overseas travel and sheer jet-lag had conspired to leave him weary and light headed until he got a few hours sleep, which the taxi ride had partially afforded him.
And in that sleep...
The dream had come as a stark, clear memory. When Marie had said that she wasn't going to join him at the Miskatonic campus in Arkham for what would be their first year of university, he had been devastated. His first questions, rushed and frantic, had been about the cause of such a change. She certainly had the SAT score to qualify and student debt could be handled with relative ease. Had she decided to forgo post-secondary to concentrate on her stake in the restaurant? Had financial problems struck and prevented admissions from being paid?
Was it something about him?
Her answers, far more controlled than his frenzied speculation, had all been in the negative. Her SAT scores were good, student loans were still open and she still intended to go for a degree in Biology at Miskatonic. It was just... after she'd gotten that phonograph from her parents' home village, the repayment had been a promise to come and spend a year back in the "Old Country" as soon as she could. It would only be for a year and then she would return, ready for university and all accompaniments.
That had been very nearly one year before. She had promised him that she would be coming back in the summer of 2011... but after she had arrived in Vietnam, all contact had stopped cold. Her parents, when asked about her condition, always responded with affirmations that she would return and that she was fine... but as winter wore onto spring, subtle hints of doubt and worry had crept into their voices. Had they even been receiving any news from their daughter and if not, then why not? Had something gone terribly wrong?
As it happened, more baffling events awaited inside.
"What do you mean, restricted?" Joseph asked the Communist Party bureaucrat sitting across the desk from him. Of course, due to the facts that first, said bureaucrat was a government employee and second, they were not alone in the room, Joseph had been careful not to sound too brunt in his tone. A trung sior Sergeant, wearing the forest green uniform of the Vietnam Border Defence Force (VPA), stood by the door of the office, both watching and guarding.
Relieved at being able to shed his stilted English after Joseph exhibited a decent grasp of the Vietnamese language, the bureaucrat put forth what he knew of the situation. "Civilian access is almost completely denied inside the area you requested. To be honest, that section of the border has been troublesome ever since the war. We get reports of smugglers, poachers, bandits, H'mong insurgents... every type of violent counter-revolutionary you can think of, this region seems to have it. The local Bru farmers aren't much help, but they generally don't bother others and seem to accept the military presence we keep there." The bureaucrat shifted his gaze from Joseph to Professor Neville Andover, the leader of this particular expedition. "I'm sorry, but there's nothing that can be done without high level authorization."
As a response to this, Neville Andover did not get upset. He did not resign himself to failure. He did not even try to ask if there was any other avenue of entry or way to access the information he needed. He just donned an odd, amused smile, the corners of his eyes crinkling behind his wire rim glasses. "I assume that General Vo is still the Secretary for the Border Forces?" He asked, almost distractedly. When the official answered yes, Professor Andover reached into the inside of his light cotton jacket and pulled out a small, metal case. From this case, he removed a single paper card of purest black, embossed with an emerald green "Delta" symbol and a capital "Y" of gold in the center of that hollow triangle. "I have been in contact with Comrade Vo for the last six months, planning this expedition as an act of cooperation between our two governments and as a boon for my University. He knows that card; show it or describe it to him... you maywant to run it by General Tran as well. Either way, they will give you the answer you need."
As the bureaucrat took the card and then as the Border Defense sergeant took it from him and headed out of the room, Joesph wondered about his professor and the oddities that surrounded him. The first time he had ever seen the Professor, it had been in his High School Auditorium as Marie had performed the Stork Dance... and Joseph had noticed strange things. In their senior year of High School, both he and Marie had received reference letters to Miskatonic University in Arkham, a town in Essex county. When he had arrived at Miskatonic (without Marie), he had been shocked that the professor for his Cultural Anthropology class was not only the one who had given him his reference but was also the man who had he had seen three years before.
And then there were his classmates, three of whom had also come on this expedition. Many of them had received similar letters from Prof. Andover and most of those, though not relaying specifics, had said that they had found the circumstances equally strange. Two who had gotten references were on this very trip with them. The first was Tracy Williams from the farm country of Northwest Virginia, a girl with blond hair quite a few shades lighter than Josephs own brassy brown and the class Nippon-Nut, being both obsessed with Anime and Manga as well as being Japanese-proficient. The second was Albert Noyes, a young man who has part white, part black and a little Algonquin-Indian from a small hamlet in southern Vermont. His specialties were technology, math and Mandarin Chinese. The third member of retinue was a young man named Malone who... frankly, was a mystery to the entire class. However, he had volunteered for this trip and his grades had been excellent so his place on the roster had been assured.
But there was still a nagging question at the back of his mind: why? Why had they received offers to go to an obscure if admittedly exceptional regional university when the big names had all passed them over? Why had they been gathered from all across the United States by a single professor? And why, it seemed, did it feel like there was such a big connection between the missing member of Dr. Andovers "collection" and the reason behind this expedition?
Why did it feel as if Marie was somehow connected to this?
Eventually, the sergeant came back and informed the bureaucrat of General Vo's express permission for the Professor and his students to enter the exclusion zone as well as General Tran's confirmation, before handing the card back to Neville Andover. Joseph knew that academics could sometimes have friends in high and unusual places, but counting on ... no, expecting the approval of not just one, but two ranking Generals in a non-allied nation? This seemed crazy, certifiably insane even.
But then, so did spectral storks and spoonbills.
Northernmost Quang Binh Province, Socialist Republic of Vietnam
June 29, 2011
Despite the calm look on the professors face, something about the current situation made Joseph Clayton distinctly ill at ease.
They had spent the last two days trudging up into the Annamite mountains after leaving the fertile coastal plain. At the last village with road access, they had ditched their vehicles and backpacked up the ridges and trails, counting on a guide from the local Bru people to lead them to... whatever Prof. Andover was looking for. The fact that the guide was now legging it quite quickly back down the misty path told Joseph that something had either gone incredibly wrong or incredibly right.
Now, Neville Andover was chanting, seemingly trying to communicate with something deep in the thick underbrush on either side of the worn, overgrown gully that had been called a trail. The language was almost intellig ible to Joseph, being a form of Mon-Khmer linked to the classical Vietnamese he had studied, perhaps with a few hints of Muong intermixed. However, the syntax and grammer were archaic to say the least. From some of the words used it even seemed to be achingly familiar, almost as if...
With a sudden realization of shock and the smell of grilled pork and Bac Bon Dzhow a memory in his nostrils, Joseph realized where he had encountered this form of Vietic before.
But the shocks were not over.
Spun around by Albert Noyes to see something, Joseph gazed upward to see a human figure standing upon the high bank, glancing down at them with hard, measuring eyes. Undoubtedly masculine, the figure was of a man of slightly darker skin than the farmers of the coast (though the features were similar) and of greater height than either them or the native Bru. Clothed only in a white cotton kilt with geometric designs in black and a leather girdle, this man carried a white flatbow decorated with bands of green, blue and red while a bronze dagger rested at his hip. His head was shaved of all hair, and black designs were tattooed from the crown of the scalp to the jawline, with more tattoos covering his arms, chest and lower legs.
The fact that an arrow was nocked in the string of his bow put the four young people on edge, with Malone and Joesph himself tightening the grips on the hilts of their machetes in anticipation of a hopeless fight. More men in similar dress and tattoos, some with bronze slashing swords, some with bronze-headed spears and others with flatbows, appeared out of the forest on either side of them. Now that Joseph could get a better look at them in the dim light filtering down through the forest canopy and the mist, their arm tattoos began looking very similar to those borne by Marie's parents while those on their faces, while different in design, were still similar in form.
All the while, Prof. Andover kept up the low chanting, of which Joseph could pick out individual words: "friend", "gods", "village", "priest", "comrade" and at least one invocation of Ho Chi Minh among them. To this, these strange men seemed to confer with each other though glances and nods before took one took a short, bamboo tube from his girdle, put one end to his mouth, took a deep breath and blew.
As the silvery-blue powder erupted from the tube, settled on the heads of the trekking academics and they each lost consciousness in turn, Joseph wondered if this could get any worse.
Meanwhile, Spoonbill Village
Tsan Pho Dao had been the Chief Priest of this village for many years, ever since the death of his father in the closing days of the American War. In that span of years, he had seen many futures and advised his people based on those futures. He had called down both ruin and plenty by invoking the power of the gods of his people. He alone, in a feat outside even the power of the hereditary village chiefs, had communicated with the Instrument of their gods, a being possessed of both boundless knowledge and an absolutely rotten temper. He also, most importantly, had an absolutely perfect memory of his entire life... and that of his father, and his father before him.
To be perfectly honest, he held a tremendous amount of power within this village. The ancestor shrines belonged to families while the hunters had their own little shrines up the mountain where midnight rituals were performed to gather poison for the tips of arrows and darts. But those rituals needed to be performed by the minor priests under his command. This temple was the spiritual center of his people for most of the year and the temple with it's darkened wood walls lit only by feeble braziers whose light was twisted by the smoke of rare and powerful incenses, with it's figurines of gods and demons carved from nephrite and jadeite brought from deep below the earth... was his domain. His and no one else'. He divined the future when possible, he performed the rites and as a result, it was he who had taken countless lives in sacrifice over the course of his adulthood: chickens, pigs, goats, buffalo... people.
As he sat at a low table in his private sanctuary, trying to divine some course for a question that had faced him for most of a year, he noticed something. One of the golden discs he used for divination, a coin looted from a Chinese caravan many centuries ago, stood up on its rim and began to roll. Following the curve of failing momentum, the coin finally came to rest at a specific point on the table, a place that held indication of the future.
Visitors... and not the "ketchup" kind of visitors.
Several Hours Later, Close to the Laos Border
The answer to Joseph Clayton's earlier question was a definite yes. When he had awoken, he had found his wrists and ankles bound, the bindings looped over a pole carried by two men with him and the other students suspended like deer carcasses. The Professor, on the other hand, had not been bound, but had found transport by sitting in a large basket suspended from one of the poles by a cord, carried by a pair of men. They had been going downhill from the crest of a ridge and were now leaving the forest, coming onto a road. First, they passed under a wooden gate where roosting spoonbills had been carved into the posts and a sun flanked by two dragons had been carved into the beams above the road.
Then Joseph saw where they were headed. A village of perhaps thirty houses was visible in the valley bottom while narrow terraces had been cut into the hills above, green with growing rice. The view quickly vanished as the men began heading into the village itself but sight was soon replaced with sound. The quiet of the forest was supplanted by the cacophony of a hundred sounds: chickens and pigs grunted and clucked as the animals rooted below the houses and around the garbage heaps while odd-looking reddish dogs, lazing in the sun on the porches of the outermost houses, whined in surprise at the new arrivals. The sounds of tools and primitive machinery clunked melodiously. The sounds of people also were audible: talking, laughing, shouting and even a few low notes of women's work songs were possible for Joseph to pick out of the general buzz... a buzz which also included Albert trying to reason with their captors and Tracy displaying an unusually foul mouth toward same.
Soon, people began to notice the men bringing in captives and a few even began to gather along the path as they entered the village, joining their dogs (or Dholes, as they were now identifiable as) who had come to sniff. It was mostly men, older boys and children who came out to watch while the women and the elderly usually went no further than windows and the porches of the stilt-houses that lined the road. Here, even hanging upside down, Joseph could notice a few things about the dress and appearance of the people
Frankly... it was a bit odd.
From what he knew, the Vietnamese national costume (in it's modern form) placed a heavy emphasis on trousers, an item of clothing that he noticed was rather conspicuously absent here. Everyone here seemed to be wearing variations on one basic outfit in either brown or black: knee-length cotton kilts, short-sleeved cotton jackets (mostly with their front fastenings closed) and either rough-woven conical hats or simple cloths tied over their heads. The men's hair appeared to be cut short to the point where one could vaguely make out the tattoos on their scalp while children varied between the same shortness for boys and a single, long braid for the girls.
Eventually they arrived in a great or square before what appeared to be the temple: a ponderous structure of wood and brick perched upon massive stone foundations, it's sloping roofs flaring outward as if to shroud the surrounding houses from the scrutiny of the heavens. Around them, a crowd had gathered on all sides, an air of excitement buzzing in the air. Men exited the house across the square from the temple entrance and despite the calm demeanour of Professor Andover, words began filtering through to Joseph that began sounding more and more disturbing; words like "kill", "sacrifice" and "ritual". But another word came, one that sent darker imaginings and images rambling through his sensation-saturated mind.
The word "eat".
"WAIT! STOP!"
Joseph knew those words as well... as well as that voice!
Out of the crowd rushed a figure dressed much like the others: brown kilt and jacket, the latter partially open to reveal a yem undergarment and with a straw hat on her head. As Joseph finally began taking in other details, he noticed the tattooed lines and whimsical designs on her lower legs and arms and on her face, lines and vaguely triangular patterns that almost resembled the features of an orangutan.
Her face... behind all the tattooing, the face of this woman was still as unmistakable to Joseph as the first day they had met in Kindergarten. To this sudden recognition, the young man could only exclaim his surprise as a soothingly familiar name.
"Marie?"
