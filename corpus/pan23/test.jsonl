She is wearing a black and white stripey t-shirt and some jeans, and then sat down next to her is another girl in a leather jacket \u2013 not a leather jacket, a denim jacket. Erm, she, the girl sitting down, is laughing. And the woman standing up is smiling a little bit, but she\u2019s not looking directly at her. Erm, maybe they\u2019re looking at something together, but that\u2019s not in the picture. The picture is just the girls. The background is just plain white. Erm, there might be some shapes underneath it, I can\u2019t really see. But for the most part it\u2019s either white or blocked out, so the focus of the picture is the girls. Erm, they look like maybe they\u2019re friends or maybe they\u2019re in a study group together, like they could be students. They look about student age. I\u2019d say like early twenties kind of age. And yeah, that\u2019s the first image. The second picture has got two boys in it, and the fo- the main, at the front of the picture is a laptop, is an Apple MacBook. Erm, and the background is, I think they\u2019re in like a study booth, maybe. Erm, there\u2019s a table at the front, and then the back is like black with green spots on it, different sizes, dots. And then one of the boys is wearing a t-shirt with flowers on it and pink writing, and he\u2019s got an earring in. And the other boy is wearing like a, I think it\u2019s like plaid or flannel, or whatever, a shirt over a white t-shirt. And he is looking at the laptop, and the other boy is looking at him. Again, I think students, in probably a study session. I think they might be in a study group together. They both ar- they seem happy to be there,  <laugh>  I don\u2019t know, kind of not outwardly smiling but a bit of a smile. Erm, seems like they get on, but I don\u2019t know if I would say, they don\u2019t really look like best friends I would say. So maybe they\u2019ve met in a study group, or maybe they\u2019re just acquaintances, I don\u2019t know. And then the third picture is, I guess again might be a study situation, because there\u2019s a boy in it holding a book that looks, it\u2019s quite a thick book, so maybe a textbook. Erm, they, there\u2019s a table at the front, like a glass table, and they\u2019re both sat, there are two people in it, both sat on a bench, I think? Erm, sorry, this one\u2019s a boy and a girl. The boy is holding a textbook and he\u2019s got a coat on, and some, I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s, I don\u2019t know. The girl has got her leather jacket on and some boots, and the background is, erm, is black with white dots making up the circle, and then a bigger circle, bigger circle, etc., etc. Erm, and maybe like I said also in a study session, erm, kind of setting, like students. They\u2019re both looking at someone else who\u2019s not in the picture, although there is a hand, so I guess that\u2019s the person\u2019s hand. And they\u2019re both looking quite at them, not each other. So I guess that person\u2019s speaking and they\u2019re both listening. Again they\u2019re both smiling, so obviously comfortable in the situation. Erm, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know about their relationship. That\u2019s not really clear in the picture, whether they\u2019re friends or just been again put together as part of maybe a project or something. And yeah, is that enough?"]}

Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent (CI) than the colour congruent (CC) condition. (M= 966.8, SD= 405.1). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( T= 403, n= 59, p= &lt; .001). Data shows that participants took longer to correctly identify the font colours when they were incongruent with the colour of the words written. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>The results that were found were consistent with previous research of Stroop (1935) and supported the hypothesis as participants did have a slower reaction time when identifying incongruent font colours and had a faster reaction time for the congruent condition. The reaction time was faster for the congruent condition because Cattell (1886) argued that wording reading is automatic therefore it\u2019s quicker for individuals to read the word represented to them in that condition. However, different research finding has been reported from a similar stroop task called emotional stroop (Williams et al. 1996). It was found that the emotional Stroop involves only emotional and neutral words and that color does not affect reaction time because it does not conflict with word meaning. The classic stroop test shows that the reaction time is slower because there is a conflict between an incongruent color and the word. Furthermore,  Salthouse and Meinz (1995) argue that even though age differences specific to stroop interference were minimal, other research may show the relationship between age and Stroop interference was still significant (West &amp; Baylis, 1998). <nl><nl>Finally, some of the methodological issues regarding the experiment were that volunteer sampling was used, only university students participated. Findings cannot be generalised to those who did not volunteer and the finding may not be representative of the whole population. An improvement could be made by selecting people of all ages not just university students. Another issue was that the experiment was not completed in a controlled environment, this means they could have had help from others. Another improvement could be that all the participants complete the test in a psychology lab. Also there may have been extraneous variables which may have affected the results, e.g. some participants may have completed at 9am, they would most likely been tired and have had a slower reaction time. This can be improved by making sure all students complete the test at the same time.", "Hi, <nl><nl>I have completed all the tasks. <nl><nl>AGE: <age><nl>DOB: &lt;DDMMYYYY&gt;<nl>Handedness (left or right): right<new>Hi <addr10_FN>, <nl><nl>I am a second-year student, and I am currently doing my transcript for the project due next week.

Lastly, another cognitive change that is observed is that the individuals affected by PTSD may lose interest in activities or avoid participating in them. These might be the activities that they enjoyed before the event occurred. <nl><nl>One of the biological changes observed is that the hippocampus is significantly smaller in individuals who develop PTSD. This region of the brain plays a role in memories related to emotion, therefore a smaller hippocampus represents a higher risk for developing PTSD after a traumatic event (Gilbertson 2002). Another biological change that is observed is the failure of the brain centres (e.g ventromedial frontal cortex) which dampens the activation of the brain's fear coordinating centre, the amygdala (Koenigs &amp; Grafman 2009). Therefore, the individual is unable to control the activation of fear after trauma."]}

Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001)."]}

This might include an increase in negative emotions and the inability to experience positive ones. For instance, if a woman was sexually abused, she might experience anxiety or fear even after her abuse. A second cognitive change might be a severe lack of interest in activities. The women might have enjoyed spending time with her friends prior to her abuse but after the abuse she might resist and avoid any involvement in activities that were once pleasurable to her. She may also blame herself for getting sexually abused. Her choice of wearing a scandalous outfit might justify why someone abused her and this would be another cognitive change.<nl><nl>There are also biological changes associated with PTSD. The amygdala is responsible for the perception of emotions and the ventromedial frontal cortex is responsible for regulating responses to emotions. However, the frontal region with those who have PTSD does not function effectively and it does not dampen down the amygdala to the same degree as it does with people without the disorder. Another biological change may be a decrease in the size of the hippocampus, and this might explain why people with PTSD have difficulties consolidating their memories.<nl><nl><nl>Question 2: Outline the proposed role of operant conditioning in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).  How would a behavioural therapist treat OCD? (Both parts of this question are equally weighted). <nl><nl>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is made up of two components, obsessions and compulsions. The compulsion refers to the repetitive behaviour, for example, suffers may regularly wash their hands to reduce anxiety. The anxiety is caused by obsessive, irrational thoughts for example, the constant fear of germs and bacteria. According to the second stage of Mowrer\u2019s (1947) two stage theory, the removal of an aversive stimulus will negatively reinforce behaviour. In other words, the removal of anxiety is caused by the compulsive acts of washing hands \u2013 negative reinforcement and the relief from the anxiety might be rewarding to a sufferer \u2013 positive reinforcement. Thus, the behaviour will perpetuate because it is both negatively and positively reinforced.<nl><nl>Behavioural therapists treat OCD using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT involves the therapist and sufferer to actively break down and challenge irrational thoughts and behaviours through exposure and response prevention (ERP). This involves the gradual exposure to the feared object, this might be a fear of dirt and individuals are counter conditioned to learn new ways to control their compulsive behaviours around the fear. Once the fear is mastered, they will adopt these changes into their daily routine and try overcome their disorder.<nl><nl>Section B<nl>Critically evaluate the concept of dependence as an explanation for substance use.<nl>Dependence is an explanation for substance use and it refers to the need for drugs in order to function and in absence of the drugs, individuals may display withdrawal symptoms. There are two types of dependence, physical and mental. Mental dependence is when the use of a substance leads to a conditioned response to an emotion or feeling. For example, someone suffering from depression might rely heavily on benzodiazepines to evoke positive emotions such as relaxation and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, this could lead to drug misuse and the dependence explanation has helped lead to practical applications to avoid this occurring. For instance, doctors will prescribe benzodiazepines only in serious cases and for less than 4 weeks to avoid dependencyaddiction. This explanation has led to a greater understanding about drugs and positive social changes.<nl><nl>The dependence explanation is limited however, because substance use could also be a result of genetic predispositions. Kendler &amp; Prescott (1998) support this notion through their research on 1,934 twins, ranging in age from 22 to 62. They were given interviews about their drug addictions to cocaine and marijuana. Kendler reported that whilst examining pairs, it was evident that the concordance rates for both twins using drugs was higher in monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ) twins. The concordance rate for cocaine use in MZ twins was 54% and in DZ twins it was 42%. Thus, this gives weight to the influence of genetics on substance use. While it is important to understand the role of heredity on substance use, environmental factors are also as important. These factors may include stress, trauma, or community pressure. Exposure to trauma has been linked closely to substance use. Witnessing death or experiencing assault would be a traumatic experience and these people are more likely to take drugs. This may be because trauma symptoms may become more manageable after self-medicating. Turning to drugs may be the easier escape for some individuals when dealing with environmental difficulties. Thus, substance use may be a result of genetic and environmental factors interacting so therefore, a diathesis stress model should be proposed.<nl><nl>Behaviourists stress the important role operant conditioning has on behaviour. Operant conditioning as proposed by Skinner (1938) can be applied to substance use. For instance, people suffering from trauma may use drugs as a coping mechanism to alleviate their trauma related symptoms (this might include shocks and mood swings). Skinner referred to negative reinforcement as the continual of behaviour to remove any aversive outcomes. Similarly, individuals might repeat the act of taking drugs because it temporarily removes their symptoms. Another concept of operant conditioning is positive reinforcement. This refers to the continual of behaviour to gain a reward. Drugs are involved in the activation of dopamine pathways. These pathways stimulate pleasure and reward thus might also explain why people continue to take drugs. Therefore, the dependent explanation can not alone explain substance use as a variety of factors and explanations might account for it.", "Hi,<nl><nl>I am a <course> undergraduate who is in second year and as part of my course I am due to do a placement year.

One is standing up and leaning over a little bit. She is wearing a black and white stripey t-shirt and some jeans, and then sat down next to her is another girl in a leather jacket \u2013 not a leather jacket, a denim jacket. Erm, she, the girl sitting down, is laughing. And the woman standing up is smiling a little bit, but she\u2019s not looking directly at her. Erm, maybe they\u2019re looking at something together, but that\u2019s not in the picture. The picture is just the girls. The background is just plain white. Erm, there might be some shapes underneath it, I can\u2019t really see. But for the most part it\u2019s either white or blocked out, so the focus of the picture is the girls. Erm, they look like maybe they\u2019re friends or maybe they\u2019re in a study group together, like they could be students. They look about student age. I\u2019d say like early twenties kind of age. And yeah, that\u2019s the first image. The second picture has got two boys in it, and the fo- the main, at the front of the picture is a laptop, is an Apple MacBook. Erm, and the background is, I think they\u2019re in like a study booth, maybe. Erm, there\u2019s a table at the front, and then the back is like black with green spots on it, different sizes, dots. And then one of the boys is wearing a t-shirt with flowers on it and pink writing, and he\u2019s got an earring in. And the other boy is wearing like a, I think it\u2019s like plaid or flannel, or whatever, a shirt over a white t-shirt. And he is looking at the laptop, and the other boy is looking at him. Again, I think students, in probably a study session. I think they might be in a study group together. They both ar- they seem happy to be there,  <laugh>  I don\u2019t know, kind of not outwardly smiling but a bit of a smile. Erm, seems like they get on, but I don\u2019t know if I would say, they don\u2019t really look like best friends I would say. So maybe they\u2019ve met in a study group, or maybe they\u2019re just acquaintances, I don\u2019t know. And then the third picture is, I guess again might be a study situation, because there\u2019s a boy in it holding a book that looks, it\u2019s quite a thick book, so maybe a textbook. Erm, they, there\u2019s a table at the front, like a glass table, and they\u2019re both sat, there are two people in it, both sat on a bench, I think? Erm, sorry, this one\u2019s a boy and a girl. The boy is holding a textbook and he\u2019s got a coat on, and some, I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s, I don\u2019t know. The girl has got her leather jacket on and some boots, and the background is, erm, is black with white dots making up the circle, and then a bigger circle, bigger circle, etc., etc. Erm, and maybe like I said also in a study session, erm, kind of setting, like students. They\u2019re both looking at someone else who\u2019s not in the picture, although there is a hand, so I guess that\u2019s the person\u2019s hand. And they\u2019re both looking quite at them, not each other. So I guess that person\u2019s speaking and they\u2019re both listening. Again they\u2019re both smiling, so obviously comfortable in the situation. Erm, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know about their relationship. That\u2019s not really clear in the picture, whether they\u2019re friends or just been again put together as part of maybe a project or something. And yeah, is that enough?"]}
{"id": "478267d9-c6e1-4e17-a530-9127d7bbee8705866", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Aims and Research Questions<nl>The lockdown amidst COVID-19 has made significant disruptions in academic activities. In this lockdown period, it was reported that learners were mostly suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety (42.0%) (Kapasia, N., Paul, P., Roy, A., Saha, J., Zaveri, A., Mallick, R., ... &amp; Chouhan, P. 2020). The negative impact on student mental and physical well-being due to lockdown restrictions, may be seen as detrimental for their academia and overall performance. Other research has been carried out on the wider population, not students specifically, however the COVID-19 lockdown can be seen to affect others negatively, in terms of mental health. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderatesevere insomnia (Gualano, M. R., Lo Moro, G., Voglino, G., Bert, F., &amp; Siliquini, R. 2020). However, research on the wider student experience during COVID-19 in the UK lacks exposure, so the given indication to the gap, conducting this research could be beneficial to raise greater awareness to the subject.<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as the chosen method<nl>IPA is concerned with lived experience. Experience covers quite a lot of territory (Cooper, H. E., Camic, P. M., Long, D. L., Panter, A. T., Rindskopf, D. E., &amp; Sher, K. J. 2012). Furthermore, IPA focuses on the detailed examination of particulars, first providing an in-depth account of each case before moving to look for patterning\u2019s of convergence and divergence across cases (Eatough, V., &amp; Smith, J. A. 2008).  This method allows the researcher to analyse and understand an individual\u2019s experience towards a certain event \u2013 which in this case would be the global pandemic and how it has affected students: it allows us to explore different aspects that may have been impacted and gives us the chance to begin to comprehend those experiences. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>1. \"Feels like a waste of a university experience\"; a student who has been affected by the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>Missing out on experiences and opportunities as a university student, is a main theme in this account - which includes spending time with friends, enjoying the nightlife, parties and academic events (e.g. lectures and seminars). Natasha draws up on the fact that the university experience she is currently having is very different to what she had prior to the COVID-19 restrictions in her first year. Although, she highlights that she had been able to enjoy some of the perks of being a student in her first year of study, she emphasises the lack of it now and realises that she had taken for granted some of the opportunities she had in first year, as she states - \"I definitely should have taken those erm (.) opportunities and just spend it with the people I like being around\". This may highlight the idea that Natasha feels regret because certain experiences are not as readily available as they were before.<nl>1.1 \"I\u2019m not seeing my friends as often as I would do... I\u2019m not going out\": the negatives highlighted due to the lockdown. <nl>Natasha was asked to compare her first year to her current year of university, and the main focus had been that there is a lack of opportunity to go out with friends - to restaurants, clubs and parties: all of which have been impacted significantly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. Further down in the interview she once again emphasises the fact that she yearns for a greater chance to go out to social events: \"I really do miss going out with them and seeing them and spending time with them\". It may suggest that Natasha, who is already limited by the distance from university to her hometown and who may have relied on interaction from social events at university, has been severely impacted and may go on to feel \"lonely\" within these circumstances, as she had previously mentioned when asked who she was able to communicate with at the moment. <nl><nl>There is no doubt that one of the main disadvantages Natasha focuses on is the idea that her personality is hindered by the lockdown: \"there is a lot of downsides...one of the things I love the most like going out, seeing my friends\", she draws attention to this significant piece missing in her life and emphasises how much she enjoys going out and seeing my friends by using the word \"love\". Due to the restrictions there may be an imbalance of work and leisure, Natasha may feel as though she is trapped in unhappiness during this global pandemic. <nl>1.2 \"...I\u2019ve not met anyone new on my course which is a bit upsetting\": the lack of engagement due to face-to-face teaching being moved online. <nl>When Natasha was asked: \"How they get along with engaging with other students\" - the response steered in a direction where she expressed a disappointment in the lack of opportunity to meet new course mates. She stated this a couple of times whilst answering this question: \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\", which may indicate that she has been deeply affected by the fact that the opportunity to engage with other students has been stripped away.<nl>University can be advertised amongst students as being a place where there is a chance to meet many different people - however, the outlook has changed significantly as those opportunities have been limited due to the restrictions; \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\" - Natasha emphasises that university no longer serves the purpose of networking and meeting new people because of social distancing.<nl><nl>2.0 \"...detached mentally from my studies\": recognising the lack of motivation.<nl>Main theme in this segment is how Natasha highlights the depletion of her mental well-being towards her studies and daily life. The lack of face-to-face teaching seems to be the reason for this, as further down the interview she mentions - \"I don\u2019t feel like a uni student (.) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m mentally there so my motivation has decreased signi-significantly\" which further supports the idea that the restrictions are detrimental to university students - due to the vast amount of lectures being moved online. This mentality and decrease of motivation may indicate a severe impact towards Natasha\u2019s mental health and well-being during this period of time. However, this could also be catastrophic for her university grades, as the lack of motivation may hinder the quality of her work and may lead her to underachieve. <nl><nl>2.1 \"...my mind is always in autopilot\": there is a lack of conscious control. <nl>Natasha goes on to use this phrase to describe her consciousness during the days in lockdown. This may emphasise the idea that her time spent in lockdown is constant and uneventful leading her to lose conscious awareness of what she is doing. The use of the word \"autopilot\" underlines the fact that she is aware that she is mentally detached from her life due to the sudden societal changes from the virus. On the other hand, it can be implied that she is comparing herself to that of a machine - where she is constantly stuck in a pattern doing the same thing daily.<nl>She goes on to mention that her \"days kinda merge into one\"- and further explains that she finds it easy to \"lose track\" of what she is doing and what she \"should be doing\",  which may lead to imply that lockdown has had both mental and physical obstacles, that Natasha has encountered and finds it difficult to plan her days and keep to a schedule. The use of the strong verb \"merge\" accentuates the difficulty Natasha is having to distinguish the days as they go by, possibly creating a blurred sense of reality whilst living with the restrictions.<nl><nl>2.2 \"spend the whole day in bed and its really taking a toll on me mentally\": is showing traits of a mental health disorder due to the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>When Natasha was asked how her daily life had changed, she proceeded to emphasise that the gym after the first lockdown, had allowed her to make progress \"mentally and physically\". However, the gyms were forced to close again following the second national lockdown. This proved to be a significant impact for Natasha \u2013 as further down in the answer she stated that she would \"spend the whole day in bed\". This may suggest that she may have been experiencing a mental health related disorder which could have been onset due to the second lockdown. This may portray the risk that the restrictions have towards the well-being of students. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, Natasha has had a wide range of negative changes and experiences whilst being a university student during the global pandemic\u2013 most aspects do relate to the new introduction of social distancing: which has proven to be a big change for her as she thrives of socialising and meeting new people. Natasha who has moved out from their hometown and is now situated in the city where she attends university is likely to feel lonely due to not being around friends or family. The decline in mental health has been evident \u2013 towards both her studies and daily life in general. Natasha finds it hard to live in the present and feels mentally absent on some days. This may indicate that being a student during the global pandemic is detrimental for individuals such as Natasha; leading to unhappiness, loneliness, disappointment, decline in mental health and being unmotivated.

Obviously, it\u2019s quite easy to get your protein, your nutrients from having meat but it\u2019s not something that, you know, I, I tend to just like obsess over.

But yeah.", "One positive symptom of schizophrenia are hallucinations, these are a sensory perception experienced in the absence of an external stimuli. These are experiences and sensations which are not comprehensible to others, but to the person experiencing them. Hallucinations include patients hearing, seeing, tasting, touching, and smelling things. An example of hallucinations is the patient may hear voices that may seem angry or urgent and often make demands on them which results in the patient getting injured.<nl><nl>Another positive symptom is delusions, these are beliefs which may conflict with reality. A schizophrenic patient will hold onto those beliefs even though they may be evidence that disproves those false beliefs. An example is paranoid delusions, they may believe people are out to hurt them or the thought people are doing things when there is no evidence that these things are taking place. <nl><nl>Lastly, a positive symptom of schizophrenia is thought disorder. This is a disorganised way of thinking which leads to abnormal ways of expressing language when speaking or writing. An example of a thought disorder is thought blocking. This the patient interrupts themselves inappropriately mid-sentence and changes the topic of conversation. They may pause for several seconds or minutes."]}

These might be the activities that they enjoyed before the event occurred. <nl><nl>One of the biological changes observed is that the hippocampus is significantly smaller in individuals who develop PTSD. This region of the brain plays a role in memories related to emotion, therefore a smaller hippocampus represents a higher risk for developing PTSD after a traumatic event (Gilbertson 2002). Another biological change that is observed is the failure of the brain centres (e.g ventromedial frontal cortex) which dampens the activation of the brain's fear coordinating centre, the amygdala (Koenigs &amp; Grafman 2009). Therefore, the individual is unable to control the activation of fear after trauma."]}

{"id": "e580cfbd-2cc2-495f-a196-f4ce5bd6c7da05815", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>This paper will examine whether there is a difference in how males and females use language when in the role of competition judge, and whether the formality of the situation has an impact. This study will focus on the politeness strategies used by each gender when critiquing the contestants. To achieve this, it will investigate the number of lines of speech, the use of positive as opposed to negative adjectives and the use of hedges or intensifiers. A hedge is a linguistic device used to mitigate a statement by lowering epistemic modality and directness with the goal of reducing the threat to face (Salager-Meyer, 1994; Brown and Levinson, 1978.) On the other hand, an intensifier is an adverb or adverbial phrase used to give emphasis (Bolinger, 1972). <nl>The data used in this study is from The Great British Bake Off (which will from here onwards be referred to as GBBO) and MasterChef: The Professionals, which will simply be referred to as MasterChef. These two programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions, but MasterChef features professional chefs and GBBO amateur bakers. There is also a difference in formality as GBBO is more informal and light-hearted which is shown by its two presenters both being comedians. On the other hand, MasterChef is more formal in tone and takes a more serious approach. <nl>This topic has been chosen as it combines politeness theories with gender theory in order to examine how they interact with each other, applying this to a competition environment. Both of the datasets are from television shows therefore it is important to take into account that they may be edited to portray people in a certain way or to best fulfil the main purpose of the shows, which is to entertain. It will be interesting to see how this artificial environment impacts the judges as they may be inclined to be more polite than usual in order to portray themselves well on television, or less polite if their career is based on them playing a \"villain\" role.<nl><nl>Research Background <nl>There has been much debate by linguistics over the relationship between gender and language and the effect the former has on the latter. One of the seminal theorists in this subject is Robin Lakoff (1975) who suggested that there are fundamental differences in how men and women use language. Most relevant to this paper was her identified differences in the use of polite forms, with women typically using more polite forms than men. Janet Holmes (2013) also agreed that women are more likely to use polite forms, although acknowledged that there are differences depending on factors such as the context of the interaction and the specific people involved. She argued that: <nl>\"when all the necessary reservations and qualifications have been taken into account, I think the answer is \u2018yes, women are more polite than men\u2019\" (Holmes, 1995: 5). <nl>It has also been suggested that women use more polite forms as they are more powerless than men (Deuchar, 1988). One theory that supports this is the dominance theory which investigated the number of interruptions between men and women in a mixed gender conversation (Zimmerman and West, 1975). The study found that men are much more likely to interrupt than women and across the eleven conversations they recorded women interrupted only twice whereas men interrupted 46 times. This supports the idea that women are more polite than men, however the study only has a small sample size of 35 participants, all of whom were from a similar background, and is over 45 years old. <nl>Looking more closely at politeness, it can be defined as a type of communication that shows respect and gives some benefit to the other communicators (Leech, 2014). It is an act which aims to maintain the other participants\u2019 positive and negative face (Goffman, 1967). <nl>Leech\u2019s politeness principle (1983) argues that speakers must follow six maxims in order to be considered polite. The theory builds on Grice\u2019s maxims of conversation (1975) but expands these maxim\u2019s and focuses them specifically on appearing polite. These maxims of politeness are; tact, generosity, approbation, modesty and agreement. This study will focus on the maxim of approbation, which involves maximising expressions of praise and approval and lessening the expressions of dispraise. <nl>In a recent study, these maxims were applied to high school students and their interactions with teachers in order to investigate how gender influences politeness (Ningsih et al., 2020). The study used a qualitive approach and gathered data through observations and recordings. They found that both male and female students adhered to the politeness principle more strongly with female teachers than with male teachers. This could suggest that how polite a speaker is depends on the gender of the person they are speaking to more than their own gender identification. Although this study looks only at the speaker and does not take into account the gender of the addressee, this could account for some of the patterns of politeness encountered and therefore is worth taking into consideration. <nl>Looking at this previous research, it could be expected that the female judges in this study will show more behaviours associated with politeness than the male judges, which will be shown through an increase of positive adjectives and a decrease of negative adjectives. It is also expected that the female judges will more often seek to minimise the amount of dispraise given and use hedges to save the hearer\u2019s positive face, whilst using more intensifiers to emphasise praise. It is also anticipated that males will dominate the conversation more, which could be seen as impolite as they allow less room in the conversation for the female judges to speak.<nl><nl>Methodology <nl>The data used in this investigation is from the final episode of the 2020 series of GBBO and the 2020 final of MasterChef. In each episode there are three contestants remaining and so, by using the first challenge they are given in each, there are three sets of comparable data for each show. Each judgement was then transcribed using the key in appendix one. The narration in MasterChef was excluded from the transcripts as it was edited in later and therefore was not part of the conversation being analysed. This analysis only focused on the judge\u2019s communication; however, the contestants and presenter\u2019s speech were included in the transcriptions for context. <nl>These programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions and so the type of praisecriticism given is comparable. However, the difference in tone and level of formality between the programmes allows a deeper investigation into the impact of context on politeness. It will be of interest to see whether the hypothesises are realised and whether the tone and formality of each programme impacts this, and if so to what extent. These programmes were also chosen as they have mixed gender judging panels thus the impact of gender can be observed. <nl>Once the data had been collected, it was analysed using a quantitative approach. The number of lines of speech by each of the judges was counted in each extract and placed into table one. In MasterChef there were three judges, two of which were male. In order to calculate the number of lines of speech for the males, the number for each judge was added together and then divided by two. Although this removes the influence of the individual, which is a disadvantage, it allows the proportion of speech by each gender to be directly compared, which for the purposes of this investigation was deemed more important. <nl>When counting the lines of speech, each line was counted as a whole regardless of the length. However, there is one result which contains a half due to the calculation used to find the average. Speech was also counted as one line if it was transcribed across two due to interruption but the utterance carried on unbroken. <nl>The use of adjectives was also counted and placed into a table (table two) and the context of the utterance was used to determine whether an adjective was used positively as praise, or negatively to criticise. The same method was then applied to the use of hedges and intensifiers, which were then discussed in a qualitative light to determine the effect they had on the overall politeness of each statement.<nl><nl>Findings <nl>i. Amount of speech by male and female judges <nl>The following table summarises the number of lines of speech made by male and female judges in each dataset. As there were two male judges in MasterChef the average number of lines of speech made between them has been used, as mentioned in the methodology. <nl><table><nl>Looking at GBBO first, on average the male judge (Paul) utters more lines of speech than the female judge (Prue). In the judgements of contestants one and three, Paul utters eight lines of speech as opposed to Prue\u2019s six lines, an increase of 28.57%. This is befitting the hypothesis that the male judge will speak more than the female judge, however the data featuring contestant two conflicts with this. In this instance, Prue has one more line of speech than Paul which is a 22.22% difference. Overall, Paul speaks more than Prue in two of the three extracts, and in there is a greater difference between the judges when Paul is the one speaking more. Across all three extracts Paul is shown to utter 16.22% more lines of speech than Prue, conforming to the expected results. <nl>Analysing the MasterChef results, the males (Gregg and Marcus) utter more lines of speech in the judgements of contestants one and two than the female judge (Monica). In the transcript featuring contestant one there is a 40% difference in the number of utterances, and in the next there is a 22.22% difference. This is a greater increase in the amount of speech by males as opposed to females than was seen in GBBO. Yet, when the judgement of contestant three is analysed, the largest difference in speech of all the transcripts is shown with Monica speaking 66.67% more lines than the male judges. This means that overall, there is only a 3.39% difference between the male and female judges, with the female judge having uttered more lines in total. This disagrees with the hypothesis that men would talk more but the difference in utterance of lines is minimal. <nl>To conclude, the data from GBBO is in accordance with the hypothesis made that males will utter more lines of speech than females, but the data from MasterChef contradicts it. There are a few possible explanations for why this might have occurred. One explanation is the difference in tone between the two shows; In MasterChef the setting is more formal and professional whereas GBBO is a more informal setting where the judges interact with the contestants more colloquially. Therefore, GBBO mirrors normal conversations more than MasterChef and the context relates more closely to that of the studies researched for this paper. There is also a difference in the way the programmes are formatted. The judgement in GBBO is more like a conversation in the first challenge, so there are examples of turn-taking within the conversation. In contrast, on MasterChef the judges speak one at a time in longer instances and there are no conversations between them. This could influence the results as it means the participants are not dominating the conversation but rather giving a longer individual monologue. <nl>It is also of note that the extracts transcribed are only a couple of minutes long and therefore there is only a relatively small amount of data. In a longer conversation there is a possibility that the difference between male and female speech could become more defined.<nl><nl>ii. Use of adjectives <nl>When categorising the use of adjectives into positive or negative classifications, the context of the sentence was used to determine what category was most appropriate. They were then collated into the table below. <nl><table><nl>For example, \"wobbly\" was classed as a positive adjective as it was used in the utterance \"I like the wobbly lines\" (Appendix three, lines 20-22). <nl>Analysing the use of adjectives by the GBBO judges, Prue used more positive adjectives with each contestant as well as a greater range of adjectives. Looking at the use of negative adjectives, both judges used a similar number however Paul used one more. Therefore, the GBBO data aligns with the hypothesis that the female judge would use more adjectives that signal praise, and the male more negative adjectives. <nl>When comparing this to the results for the MasterChef data, Monica used an equal number of negative adjectives as Marcus, and one more than Gregg who did not use any. This contradicts the hypothesis and suggests that Monica is more willing to risk threatening the contestants face than Gregg, who only uses compliments. When judging the first contestant, Gregg used seven times as many adjectives to give praise than Monica did, and more than twice as many as Marcus. With the next contestant all three judges used the same number of positive adjectives and with the final contestant Monica used the most; using four times as many as Gregg and twice as many as Marcus. Ranking the judges based on their use of positive minus negative adjectives, Marcus and Monica both ranked the same and Gregg ranked highest meaning he is most concerned with politeness and least willing to flout the maxim of approbation. In summary, the data from MasterChef does not support the hypothesis and contrasts with the GBBO results. <nl><nl>iii. Use of hedges and intensifiers <nl>Within this table a colour-coding system has been using to differentiate between the hedges and intensifiers that have been used in relation to negative statements, and those that have been used positively. Text in green represents the words and phrases that have be used in relation to praise, and red has been used for text that relates to dispraise or criticism. <nl><table><nl>The intensifier \"very very\" was kept as one phrase within the table rather than two instances of the word \"very\" to emphasise how strongly the praise was given. <nl>The results from the analysis on hedging and intensifiers is similar to the patterns seen when investigating the use of adjectives. In the GBBO data, Prue used more positively associated hedges and intensifiers and fewer negative ones than Paul. <nl>Similarly, in the MasterChef data Gregg did not use any negative forms of these linguistic features which correlates with his use of adjectives. Although Marcus used more negative forms of the features than Monica, he also used more positive forms therefore showing they have an equal level of politeness as shown with their use of adjectives. <nl>Overall, this section again confirms that the judges in GBBO conform to the ideas of gender and politeness, whereas the judges in MasterChef do not. This could be down to the individual\u2019s character, as the social constructivist theory suggests that gender is only one part of our identity that influences communication; Personality, status, level of education and ethnicity also all serve to shape our communication (Burr, 2015). It suggests that people make each element of this construction relevant or irrelevant as is necessary. This suggests that Monica and Gregg could be choosing not to make their gender relevant to their role as judge, and each is relying on other factors to influence their use of praise instead. <nl><nl>Discussion <nl>One section that is particularly interesting is where Paul and Prue discussed the issues with Dave\u2019s custard slice in the GGBO. In the extract below, both judges use a mixture of hedges and praise to try and soften their criticism of Dave and minimise their flouting of the maxim of approbation. <nl><data_extract><nl>In cooking the adjective \"strong\" can be both positive or negative. In this extract Prue signals that she is using it positively by her use of the phrase \"I love the coffee\" before describing it as strong, thereby using it to praise Dave. The use of the intensifier \"really\" emphasises the strength of the flavour which adds to this praise. This extract also features the word \"stodgy\" three times. In the first instance, Paul used it to criticise Dave\u2019s custard which is an example of a positive face threatening act. However, Paul lessens the impact of the criticism by using the hedging phrase \"a little bit\" therefore minimising the expression of dispraise as laid out in Leech\u2019s maxim of approbation (1983). Prue then repeats this criticism however she uses the adjective \"stodgy\" twice with an emphasis on the first time. In this instance she is using the first expression of stodgy as a hedge to minimise the impact of the second expression, hereby implying it is not as bad as it could be and is only minorly stodgy. Again, this helps to minimise the impoliteness and helps to save face. \"Pretty\" is also used as a hedge in this extract, which lessens the compliment of it being \"delicious\". The use of the adverb \"still\" serves to further lessen it, so although Prue is paying a compliment, she is still acknowledging that the baking has flaws. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, the hypothesises that female judges would use more language concerned with politeness were realised to a certain extent. The patterns of communication shown by the GBBO judges did match up with what was expected, however the judges in MasterChef conformed to these expectations to a much lesser extent. This could be due to the formality of the show as opposed to the more colloquial nature of The Great British Bake Off, although it could also be due to the individual backgrounds and personalities of each judge. There is also a possibility that the gender of the contestant being judged has an impact on how the judges use politeness. Future research could investigate further by looking at a greater range of programmes and including more data for each. There is also an age difference of 35 years between the two female judges so it could be interesting to investigate deeper into how the changes in society between these years have influenced how women use language in reference to politeness.", "Hi <addr5_FN>,<nl><nl><nl>Hope you are well.

Lastly, another cognitive change that is observed is that the individuals affected by PTSD may lose interest in activities or avoid participating in them. These might be the activities that they enjoyed before the event occurred. <nl><nl>One of the biological changes observed is that the hippocampus is significantly smaller in individuals who develop PTSD. This region of the brain plays a role in memories related to emotion, therefore a smaller hippocampus represents a higher risk for developing PTSD after a traumatic event (Gilbertson 2002). Another biological change that is observed is the failure of the brain centres (e.g ventromedial frontal cortex) which dampens the activation of the brain's fear coordinating centre, the amygdala (Koenigs &amp; Grafman 2009). Therefore, the individual is unable to control the activation of fear after trauma."]}

{"id": "76a684eb-bd7a-47de-8573-bc572eb0d618", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Aims and Research Questions<nl>The lockdown amidst COVID-19 has made significant disruptions in academic activities. In this lockdown period, it was reported that learners were mostly suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety (42.0%) (Kapasia, N., Paul, P., Roy, A., Saha, J., Zaveri, A., Mallick, R., ... &amp; Chouhan, P. 2020). The negative impact on student mental and physical well-being due to lockdown restrictions, may be seen as detrimental for their academia and overall performance. Other research has been carried out on the wider population, not students specifically, however the COVID-19 lockdown can be seen to affect others negatively, in terms of mental health. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderatesevere insomnia (Gualano, M. R., Lo Moro, G., Voglino, G., Bert, F., &amp; Siliquini, R. 2020). However, research on the wider student experience during COVID-19 in the UK lacks exposure, so the given indication to the gap, conducting this research could be beneficial to raise greater awareness to the subject.<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as the chosen method<nl>IPA is concerned with lived experience. Experience covers quite a lot of territory (Cooper, H. E., Camic, P. M., Long, D. L., Panter, A. T., Rindskopf, D. E., &amp; Sher, K. J. 2012). Furthermore, IPA focuses on the detailed examination of particulars, first providing an in-depth account of each case before moving to look for patterning\u2019s of convergence and divergence across cases (Eatough, V., &amp; Smith, J. A. 2008).  This method allows the researcher to analyse and understand an individual\u2019s experience towards a certain event \u2013 which in this case would be the global pandemic and how it has affected students: it allows us to explore different aspects that may have been impacted and gives us the chance to begin to comprehend those experiences. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>1. \"Feels like a waste of a university experience\"; a student who has been affected by the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>Missing out on experiences and opportunities as a university student, is a main theme in this account - which includes spending time with friends, enjoying the nightlife, parties and academic events (e.g. lectures and seminars). Natasha draws up on the fact that the university experience she is currently having is very different to what she had prior to the COVID-19 restrictions in her first year. Although, she highlights that she had been able to enjoy some of the perks of being a student in her first year of study, she emphasises the lack of it now and realises that she had taken for granted some of the opportunities she had in first year, as she states - \"I definitely should have taken those erm (.) opportunities and just spend it with the people I like being around\". This may highlight the idea that Natasha feels regret because certain experiences are not as readily available as they were before.<nl>1.1 \"I\u2019m not seeing my friends as often as I would do... I\u2019m not going out\": the negatives highlighted due to the lockdown. <nl>Natasha was asked to compare her first year to her current year of university, and the main focus had been that there is a lack of opportunity to go out with friends - to restaurants, clubs and parties: all of which have been impacted significantly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. Further down in the interview she once again emphasises the fact that she yearns for a greater chance to go out to social events: \"I really do miss going out with them and seeing them and spending time with them\". It may suggest that Natasha, who is already limited by the distance from university to her hometown and who may have relied on interaction from social events at university, has been severely impacted and may go on to feel \"lonely\" within these circumstances, as she had previously mentioned when asked who she was able to communicate with at the moment. <nl><nl>There is no doubt that one of the main disadvantages Natasha focuses on is the idea that her personality is hindered by the lockdown: \"there is a lot of downsides...one of the things I love the most like going out, seeing my friends\", she draws attention to this significant piece missing in her life and emphasises how much she enjoys going out and seeing my friends by using the word \"love\". Due to the restrictions there may be an imbalance of work and leisure, Natasha may feel as though she is trapped in unhappiness during this global pandemic. <nl>1.2 \"...I\u2019ve not met anyone new on my course which is a bit upsetting\": the lack of engagement due to face-to-face teaching being moved online. <nl>When Natasha was asked: \"How they get along with engaging with other students\" - the response steered in a direction where she expressed a disappointment in the lack of opportunity to meet new course mates. She stated this a couple of times whilst answering this question: \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\", which may indicate that she has been deeply affected by the fact that the opportunity to engage with other students has been stripped away.<nl>University can be advertised amongst students as being a place where there is a chance to meet many different people - however, the outlook has changed significantly as those opportunities have been limited due to the restrictions; \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\" - Natasha emphasises that university no longer serves the purpose of networking and meeting new people because of social distancing.<nl><nl>2.0 \"...detached mentally from my studies\": recognising the lack of motivation.<nl>Main theme in this segment is how Natasha highlights the depletion of her mental well-being towards her studies and daily life. The lack of face-to-face teaching seems to be the reason for this, as further down the interview she mentions - \"I don\u2019t feel like a uni student (.) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m mentally there so my motivation has decreased signi-significantly\" which further supports the idea that the restrictions are detrimental to university students - due to the vast amount of lectures being moved online. This mentality and decrease of motivation may indicate a severe impact towards Natasha\u2019s mental health and well-being during this period of time. However, this could also be catastrophic for her university grades, as the lack of motivation may hinder the quality of her work and may lead her to underachieve. <nl><nl>2.1 \"...my mind is always in autopilot\": there is a lack of conscious control. <nl>Natasha goes on to use this phrase to describe her consciousness during the days in lockdown. This may emphasise the idea that her time spent in lockdown is constant and uneventful leading her to lose conscious awareness of what she is doing. The use of the word \"autopilot\" underlines the fact that she is aware that she is mentally detached from her life due to the sudden societal changes from the virus. On the other hand, it can be implied that she is comparing herself to that of a machine - where she is constantly stuck in a pattern doing the same thing daily.<nl>She goes on to mention that her \"days kinda merge into one\"- and further explains that she finds it easy to \"lose track\" of what she is doing and what she \"should be doing\",  which may lead to imply that lockdown has had both mental and physical obstacles, that Natasha has encountered and finds it difficult to plan her days and keep to a schedule. The use of the strong verb \"merge\" accentuates the difficulty Natasha is having to distinguish the days as they go by, possibly creating a blurred sense of reality whilst living with the restrictions.<nl><nl>2.2 \"spend the whole day in bed and its really taking a toll on me mentally\": is showing traits of a mental health disorder due to the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>When Natasha was asked how her daily life had changed, she proceeded to emphasise that the gym after the first lockdown, had allowed her to make progress \"mentally and physically\". However, the gyms were forced to close again following the second national lockdown. This proved to be a significant impact for Natasha \u2013 as further down in the answer she stated that she would \"spend the whole day in bed\". This may suggest that she may have been experiencing a mental health related disorder which could have been onset due to the second lockdown. This may portray the risk that the restrictions have towards the well-being of students. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, Natasha has had a wide range of negative changes and experiences whilst being a university student during the global pandemic\u2013 most aspects do relate to the new introduction of social distancing: which has proven to be a big change for her as she thrives of socialising and meeting new people. Natasha who has moved out from their hometown and is now situated in the city where she attends university is likely to feel lonely due to not being around friends or family. The decline in mental health has been evident \u2013 towards both her studies and daily life in general. Natasha finds it hard to live in the present and feels mentally absent on some days. This may indicate that being a student during the global pandemic is detrimental for individuals such as Natasha; leading to unhappiness, loneliness, disappointment, decline in mental health and being unmotivated.

It is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued left than when cued right. Data from 38 participants was used. Within-subjects design. Independent variable had two levels: cue left, cue right. Dependant variable was the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V). EEG electrodes were attached to relevant areas using the 1020 system. The results showed that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions. The results are consistent with the hypothesis and previous research.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>The alpha inhibition hypothesis refers to the concept that high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha wave in the relaxation state has higher power spectrum than in the attention state. Yaomanee, K., Pan-ngum, S., &amp; Ayuthaya, P. I. N. (2012). Concluding that alpha activity can be modulated by attention, thus meaning that alpha activity is reduced when we pay attention to stimuli.<nl>This experiment is a partial replication of Sauseng et al., (2005). Overall, 22 participants used, and they were given a cued visual attention task. Cued with a fixation cross for 34ms, then an arrow cue would indicate which hemifield a target would appear in. There was a 50% chance of being cued left or right, 75% of the trials were valid and 25% of trials were invalid. Results indicated that parietal regions showed stronger alpha lower band frequency suppression contralateral to the attended hemifield. Similar results for upper frequencies. Therefore, the alpha inhibition hypothesis is supported by these findings as there is stronger alpha activity in the task irrelevant brain areas. <nl>To further support these findings, Mazahari et al., (2014) used 57 adolescent participants: 23 normally developing, 17 who have combined subtype ADHD (inattention and hyperactivity) and 17 who have predominantly inattentive ADHD. Used a cued flanker task. Response preparation cue predicted 84% accuracy, or a null cue was shown which had no information about correct response. Overall participants showed alpha suppression following response preparation cues, greater for normally developing participants and least for inattentive ADHD subtypes. The indicative alpha suppression supports the idea that alpha activity can be modulated by attention \u2013 thus being reduced when participants attended to the stimuli.<nl>Following on previous studies, it is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued to expect a stimulus on the left than when cued to expect a stimulus on the right, when recording from the left parietal lobe (P3).  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>To begin with, 39 undergraduate participants were obtained by volunteer sample, however, one participant was removed as they were only available for one of the two conditions: 38 participants overall. <nl>Design <nl>Within subject\u2019s design, with an independent variable of cue direction with two levels: either left or right. The dependent variable is the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V).<nl><nl>Materials <nl>A Biopac MP36 was used to record alpha range activity and receive event markers for cue left and cue right conditions. EEG electrodes which were attached to the head. AC Cream and Everi cream was used, in preparation prior to the attachment of electrodes. The software PsychoPy was used to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. Stimuli were used to present to the visual fields such as: arrow cues left (&lt;) and right (&gt;), large bar (Figure A) and small bar (Figure B) stimuli. <nl><figure><nl> <nl>Procedure <nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz. Digital channels were set up to receive the event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker. A calculation channel was also set up to record the activity in the alpha frequency range of (8 - 13 Hz). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. <nl>Before preparing the participants, they gave informed consent and were briefed on their right to withdraw from the experiment. To prepare the participants for electrode placement, Everi cream was used to abrase the areas P3, Fz and forehead, selected using the 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Techologies, 2012). The AC cream was then applied on the electrodes: an active electrode was attached to P3. Reference electrodes are attached at Fz. Earth electrodes were attached to the forehead, near the hairline. The impedance levels were checked to be below 10Kohms.  <nl>Participants were given instructions and a practice trial first and were cued with an arrow for 35ms to let participants know which side to expect a stimulus, with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) set to 600ms-800ms in the practice trial. Different event markers were sent at stimulus onset for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli consisted of either large or small white bars shown either left or right on the screen on a black background for 50ms. The participants respond with either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. They underwent 12 practice trials including feedback about their response, before undergoing 4 blocks of 20 trials. After the practice trail was complete, the participants were given feedback on their performance.<nl>The participants were shortly warned that the real experiment was about to start. The random ISI was set to 200ms-1200ms<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>To covert the raw 9-13 Hz Alpha EEG to averaged data. Event markers from PsychoPy were sent to identify when stimuli were presented. Then looked at the period 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown. The data was rectified, which turns the negative values into positive, in order to show alpha activity regardless of it being excitatory or inhibitory. Averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of the outlying or extreme values. The rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were then suitable for statistical analysis. <nl>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics<nl>Firstly, to determine whether the data is parametric, a Shapiro-Wilk test was used and p&lt;.005. The p value is less than .05, therefore, a non-parametric equivalent had to be used: <nl>Wilcoxon signed ranks test. <nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions and a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed this difference was significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were consistent with the predicted hypothesis, as the median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left, than cue right and this supports the idea that alpha activity at P3 is different depending on which side participants are cued to expect a stimulus. <nl>The results also support previous research and the alpha inhibition hypothesis, as high alpha shows the inhibition of task irrelevant areas due to more activity in the left hemisphere (Klimesch et al., 2007), on the ipsilateral side of where the cue was presented. <nl>Although the results are consistent with the hypothesis, confounding variables may have altered the data to an extent. The participants moving around, may have altered the validity as gross motor movements may contaminate the EEG recordings, (Bell, M. A., &amp; Cuevas, K., 2012).<nl>Overall, there may be some areas for improvement to prevent confounding variables from affecting the data. To prevent motor movements, the participants should be given strict instructions to follow due to the sensitivity of the EEG. The researchers should monitor the participants to check if those instructions are being followed. However, despite these issues, the results can be granted as valid as the correct procedures were taken during the experiment, such as ensuring the impedance levels were below 10Kohms and in addition the results were expected due to previous research.", "Hi, I completely forgot to mention yesterday that I\u2019ve got an orthodontist appointment again this morning, if there\u2019s any new topics covered in today\u2019s lesson can you please let me know.<nl><nl>Thank you,<nl><part_FN> <new>Hi, I\u2019ve ordered from <business> on the <DDth> of <month> with express delivery in order to receive it before <event>.

{"id": "bf125509-3d27-42e2-9c38-0cdb6a2575b305466", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Abnormal Psychology Exam<nl><nl>Section A:<nl>Question 1: Outline the biological and cognitive changes that are observed in Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).<nl><nl>PTSD involves cognitive changes. This might include an increase in negative emotions and the inability to experience positive ones. For instance, if a woman was sexually abused, she might experience anxiety or fear even after her abuse. A second cognitive change might be a severe lack of interest in activities. The women might have enjoyed spending time with her friends prior to her abuse but after the abuse she might resist and avoid any involvement in activities that were once pleasurable to her. She may also blame herself for getting sexually abused. Her choice of wearing a scandalous outfit might justify why someone abused her and this would be another cognitive change.<nl><nl>There are also biological changes associated with PTSD. The amygdala is responsible for the perception of emotions and the ventromedial frontal cortex is responsible for regulating responses to emotions. However, the frontal region with those who have PTSD does not function effectively and it does not dampen down the amygdala to the same degree as it does with people without the disorder. Another biological change may be a decrease in the size of the hippocampus, and this might explain why people with PTSD have difficulties consolidating their memories.<nl><nl><nl>Question 2: Outline the proposed role of operant conditioning in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).  How would a behavioural therapist treat OCD? (Both parts of this question are equally weighted). <nl><nl>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is made up of two components, obsessions and compulsions. The compulsion refers to the repetitive behaviour, for example, suffers may regularly wash their hands to reduce anxiety. The anxiety is caused by obsessive, irrational thoughts for example, the constant fear of germs and bacteria. According to the second stage of Mowrer\u2019s (1947) two stage theory, the removal of an aversive stimulus will negatively reinforce behaviour. In other words, the removal of anxiety is caused by the compulsive acts of washing hands \u2013 negative reinforcement and the relief from the anxiety might be rewarding to a sufferer \u2013 positive reinforcement. Thus, the behaviour will perpetuate because it is both negatively and positively reinforced.<nl><nl>Behavioural therapists treat OCD using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT involves the therapist and sufferer to actively break down and challenge irrational thoughts and behaviours through exposure and response prevention (ERP). This involves the gradual exposure to the feared object, this might be a fear of dirt and individuals are counter conditioned to learn new ways to control their compulsive behaviours around the fear. Once the fear is mastered, they will adopt these changes into their daily routine and try overcome their disorder.<nl><nl>Section B<nl>Critically evaluate the concept of dependence as an explanation for substance use.<nl>Dependence is an explanation for substance use and it refers to the need for drugs in order to function and in absence of the drugs, individuals may display withdrawal symptoms. There are two types of dependence, physical and mental. Mental dependence is when the use of a substance leads to a conditioned response to an emotion or feeling. For example, someone suffering from depression might rely heavily on benzodiazepines to evoke positive emotions such as relaxation and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, this could lead to drug misuse and the dependence explanation has helped lead to practical applications to avoid this occurring. For instance, doctors will prescribe benzodiazepines only in serious cases and for less than 4 weeks to avoid dependencyaddiction. This explanation has led to a greater understanding about drugs and positive social changes.<nl><nl>The dependence explanation is limited however, because substance use could also be a result of genetic predispositions. Kendler &amp; Prescott (1998) support this notion through their research on 1,934 twins, ranging in age from 22 to 62. They were given interviews about their drug addictions to cocaine and marijuana. Kendler reported that whilst examining pairs, it was evident that the concordance rates for both twins using drugs was higher in monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ) twins. The concordance rate for cocaine use in MZ twins was 54% and in DZ twins it was 42%. Thus, this gives weight to the influence of genetics on substance use. While it is important to understand the role of heredity on substance use, environmental factors are also as important. These factors may include stress, trauma, or community pressure. Exposure to trauma has been linked closely to substance use. Witnessing death or experiencing assault would be a traumatic experience and these people are more likely to take drugs. This may be because trauma symptoms may become more manageable after self-medicating. Turning to drugs may be the easier escape for some individuals when dealing with environmental difficulties. Thus, substance use may be a result of genetic and environmental factors interacting so therefore, a diathesis stress model should be proposed.<nl><nl>Behaviourists stress the important role operant conditioning has on behaviour. Operant conditioning as proposed by Skinner (1938) can be applied to substance use. For instance, people suffering from trauma may use drugs as a coping mechanism to alleviate their trauma related symptoms (this might include shocks and mood swings). Skinner referred to negative reinforcement as the continual of behaviour to remove any aversive outcomes. Similarly, individuals might repeat the act of taking drugs because it temporarily removes their symptoms. Another concept of operant conditioning is positive reinforcement. This refers to the continual of behaviour to gain a reward. Drugs are involved in the activation of dopamine pathways. These pathways stimulate pleasure and reward thus might also explain why people continue to take drugs.

She is wearing a black and white stripey t-shirt and some jeans, and then sat down next to her is another girl in a leather jacket \u2013 not a leather jacket, a denim jacket. Erm, she, the girl sitting down, is laughing. And the woman standing up is smiling a little bit, but she\u2019s not looking directly at her. Erm, maybe they\u2019re looking at something together, but that\u2019s not in the picture. The picture is just the girls. The background is just plain white. Erm, there might be some shapes underneath it, I can\u2019t really see. But for the most part it\u2019s either white or blocked out, so the focus of the picture is the girls. Erm, they look like maybe they\u2019re friends or maybe they\u2019re in a study group together, like they could be students. They look about student age. I\u2019d say like early twenties kind of age. And yeah, that\u2019s the first image. The second picture has got two boys in it, and the fo- the main, at the front of the picture is a laptop, is an Apple MacBook. Erm, and the background is, I think they\u2019re in like a study booth, maybe. Erm, there\u2019s a table at the front, and then the back is like black with green spots on it, different sizes, dots. And then one of the boys is wearing a t-shirt with flowers on it and pink writing, and he\u2019s got an earring in. And the other boy is wearing like a, I think it\u2019s like plaid or flannel, or whatever, a shirt over a white t-shirt. And he is looking at the laptop, and the other boy is looking at him. Again, I think students, in probably a study session. I think they might be in a study group together. They both ar- they seem happy to be there,  <laugh>  I don\u2019t know, kind of not outwardly smiling but a bit of a smile. Erm, seems like they get on, but I don\u2019t know if I would say, they don\u2019t really look like best friends I would say. So maybe they\u2019ve met in a study group, or maybe they\u2019re just acquaintances, I don\u2019t know. And then the third picture is, I guess again might be a study situation, because there\u2019s a boy in it holding a book that looks, it\u2019s quite a thick book, so maybe a textbook. Erm, they, there\u2019s a table at the front, like a glass table, and they\u2019re both sat, there are two people in it, both sat on a bench, I think? Erm, sorry, this one\u2019s a boy and a girl. The boy is holding a textbook and he\u2019s got a coat on, and some, I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s, I don\u2019t know. The girl has got her leather jacket on and some boots, and the background is, erm, is black with white dots making up the circle, and then a bigger circle, bigger circle, etc., etc. Erm, and maybe like I said also in a study session, erm, kind of setting, like students. They\u2019re both looking at someone else who\u2019s not in the picture, although there is a hand, so I guess that\u2019s the person\u2019s hand. And they\u2019re both looking quite at them, not each other. So I guess that person\u2019s speaking and they\u2019re both listening. Again they\u2019re both smiling, so obviously comfortable in the situation. Erm, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know about their relationship. That\u2019s not really clear in the picture, whether they\u2019re friends or just been again put together as part of maybe a project or something. And yeah, is that enough?"]}

It is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued left than when cued right. Data from 38 participants was used. Within-subjects design. Independent variable had two levels: cue left, cue right. Dependant variable was the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V). EEG electrodes were attached to relevant areas using the 1020 system. The results showed that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions. The results are consistent with the hypothesis and previous research.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>The alpha inhibition hypothesis refers to the concept that high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha wave in the relaxation state has higher power spectrum than in the attention state. Yaomanee, K., Pan-ngum, S., &amp; Ayuthaya, P. I. N. (2012). Concluding that alpha activity can be modulated by attention, thus meaning that alpha activity is reduced when we pay attention to stimuli.<nl>This experiment is a partial replication of Sauseng et al., (2005). Overall, 22 participants used, and they were given a cued visual attention task. Cued with a fixation cross for 34ms, then an arrow cue would indicate which hemifield a target would appear in. There was a 50% chance of being cued left or right, 75% of the trials were valid and 25% of trials were invalid. Results indicated that parietal regions showed stronger alpha lower band frequency suppression contralateral to the attended hemifield. Similar results for upper frequencies. Therefore, the alpha inhibition hypothesis is supported by these findings as there is stronger alpha activity in the task irrelevant brain areas. <nl>To further support these findings, Mazahari et al., (2014) used 57 adolescent participants: 23 normally developing, 17 who have combined subtype ADHD (inattention and hyperactivity) and 17 who have predominantly inattentive ADHD. Used a cued flanker task. Response preparation cue predicted 84% accuracy, or a null cue was shown which had no information about correct response. Overall participants showed alpha suppression following response preparation cues, greater for normally developing participants and least for inattentive ADHD subtypes. The indicative alpha suppression supports the idea that alpha activity can be modulated by attention \u2013 thus being reduced when participants attended to the stimuli.<nl>Following on previous studies, it is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued to expect a stimulus on the left than when cued to expect a stimulus on the right, when recording from the left parietal lobe (P3).  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>To begin with, 39 undergraduate participants were obtained by volunteer sample, however, one participant was removed as they were only available for one of the two conditions: 38 participants overall. <nl>Design <nl>Within subject\u2019s design, with an independent variable of cue direction with two levels: either left or right. The dependent variable is the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V).<nl><nl>Materials <nl>A Biopac MP36 was used to record alpha range activity and receive event markers for cue left and cue right conditions. EEG electrodes which were attached to the head. AC Cream and Everi cream was used, in preparation prior to the attachment of electrodes. The software PsychoPy was used to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. Stimuli were used to present to the visual fields such as: arrow cues left (&lt;) and right (&gt;), large bar (Figure A) and small bar (Figure B) stimuli. <nl><figure><nl> <nl>Procedure <nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz. Digital channels were set up to receive the event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker. A calculation channel was also set up to record the activity in the alpha frequency range of (8 - 13 Hz). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. <nl>Before preparing the participants, they gave informed consent and were briefed on their right to withdraw from the experiment. To prepare the participants for electrode placement, Everi cream was used to abrase the areas P3, Fz and forehead, selected using the 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Techologies, 2012). The AC cream was then applied on the electrodes: an active electrode was attached to P3. Reference electrodes are attached at Fz. Earth electrodes were attached to the forehead, near the hairline. The impedance levels were checked to be below 10Kohms.  <nl>Participants were given instructions and a practice trial first and were cued with an arrow for 35ms to let participants know which side to expect a stimulus, with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) set to 600ms-800ms in the practice trial. Different event markers were sent at stimulus onset for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli consisted of either large or small white bars shown either left or right on the screen on a black background for 50ms. The participants respond with either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. They underwent 12 practice trials including feedback about their response, before undergoing 4 blocks of 20 trials. After the practice trail was complete, the participants were given feedback on their performance.<nl>The participants were shortly warned that the real experiment was about to start. The random ISI was set to 200ms-1200ms<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>To covert the raw 9-13 Hz Alpha EEG to averaged data. Event markers from PsychoPy were sent to identify when stimuli were presented. Then looked at the period 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown. The data was rectified, which turns the negative values into positive, in order to show alpha activity regardless of it being excitatory or inhibitory. Averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of the outlying or extreme values. The rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were then suitable for statistical analysis. <nl>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics<nl>Firstly, to determine whether the data is parametric, a Shapiro-Wilk test was used and p&lt;.005. The p value is less than .05, therefore, a non-parametric equivalent had to be used: <nl>Wilcoxon signed ranks test. <nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions and a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed this difference was significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were consistent with the predicted hypothesis, as the median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left, than cue right and this supports the idea that alpha activity at P3 is different depending on which side participants are cued to expect a stimulus. <nl>The results also support previous research and the alpha inhibition hypothesis, as high alpha shows the inhibition of task irrelevant areas due to more activity in the left hemisphere (Klimesch et al., 2007), on the ipsilateral side of where the cue was presented. <nl>Although the results are consistent with the hypothesis, confounding variables may have altered the data to an extent. The participants moving around, may have altered the validity as gross motor movements may contaminate the EEG recordings, (Bell, M. A., &amp; Cuevas, K., 2012).<nl>Overall, there may be some areas for improvement to prevent confounding variables from affecting the data. To prevent motor movements, the participants should be given strict instructions to follow due to the sensitivity of the EEG. The researchers should monitor the participants to check if those instructions are being followed. However, despite these issues, the results can be granted as valid as the correct procedures were taken during the experiment, such as ensuring the impedance levels were below 10Kohms and in addition the results were expected due to previous research.", " Yeah.

This might include an increase in negative emotions and the inability to experience positive ones. For instance, if a woman was sexually abused, she might experience anxiety or fear even after her abuse. A second cognitive change might be a severe lack of interest in activities. The women might have enjoyed spending time with her friends prior to her abuse but after the abuse she might resist and avoid any involvement in activities that were once pleasurable to her. She may also blame herself for getting sexually abused. Her choice of wearing a scandalous outfit might justify why someone abused her and this would be another cognitive change.<nl><nl>There are also biological changes associated with PTSD. The amygdala is responsible for the perception of emotions and the ventromedial frontal cortex is responsible for regulating responses to emotions. However, the frontal region with those who have PTSD does not function effectively and it does not dampen down the amygdala to the same degree as it does with people without the disorder. Another biological change may be a decrease in the size of the hippocampus, and this might explain why people with PTSD have difficulties consolidating their memories.<nl><nl><nl>Question 2: Outline the proposed role of operant conditioning in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).  How would a behavioural therapist treat OCD? (Both parts of this question are equally weighted). <nl><nl>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is made up of two components, obsessions and compulsions. The compulsion refers to the repetitive behaviour, for example, suffers may regularly wash their hands to reduce anxiety. The anxiety is caused by obsessive, irrational thoughts for example, the constant fear of germs and bacteria. According to the second stage of Mowrer\u2019s (1947) two stage theory, the removal of an aversive stimulus will negatively reinforce behaviour. In other words, the removal of anxiety is caused by the compulsive acts of washing hands \u2013 negative reinforcement and the relief from the anxiety might be rewarding to a sufferer \u2013 positive reinforcement. Thus, the behaviour will perpetuate because it is both negatively and positively reinforced.<nl><nl>Behavioural therapists treat OCD using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT involves the therapist and sufferer to actively break down and challenge irrational thoughts and behaviours through exposure and response prevention (ERP). This involves the gradual exposure to the feared object, this might be a fear of dirt and individuals are counter conditioned to learn new ways to control their compulsive behaviours around the fear. Once the fear is mastered, they will adopt these changes into their daily routine and try overcome their disorder.<nl><nl>Section B<nl>Critically evaluate the concept of dependence as an explanation for substance use.<nl>Dependence is an explanation for substance use and it refers to the need for drugs in order to function and in absence of the drugs, individuals may display withdrawal symptoms. There are two types of dependence, physical and mental. Mental dependence is when the use of a substance leads to a conditioned response to an emotion or feeling. For example, someone suffering from depression might rely heavily on benzodiazepines to evoke positive emotions such as relaxation and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, this could lead to drug misuse and the dependence explanation has helped lead to practical applications to avoid this occurring. For instance, doctors will prescribe benzodiazepines only in serious cases and for less than 4 weeks to avoid dependencyaddiction. This explanation has led to a greater understanding about drugs and positive social changes.<nl><nl>The dependence explanation is limited however, because substance use could also be a result of genetic predispositions. Kendler &amp; Prescott (1998) support this notion through their research on 1,934 twins, ranging in age from 22 to 62. They were given interviews about their drug addictions to cocaine and marijuana. Kendler reported that whilst examining pairs, it was evident that the concordance rates for both twins using drugs was higher in monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ) twins. The concordance rate for cocaine use in MZ twins was 54% and in DZ twins it was 42%. Thus, this gives weight to the influence of genetics on substance use. While it is important to understand the role of heredity on substance use, environmental factors are also as important. These factors may include stress, trauma, or community pressure. Exposure to trauma has been linked closely to substance use. Witnessing death or experiencing assault would be a traumatic experience and these people are more likely to take drugs. This may be because trauma symptoms may become more manageable after self-medicating. Turning to drugs may be the easier escape for some individuals when dealing with environmental difficulties. Thus, substance use may be a result of genetic and environmental factors interacting so therefore, a diathesis stress model should be proposed.<nl><nl>Behaviourists stress the important role operant conditioning has on behaviour. Operant conditioning as proposed by Skinner (1938) can be applied to substance use. For instance, people suffering from trauma may use drugs as a coping mechanism to alleviate their trauma related symptoms (this might include shocks and mood swings). Skinner referred to negative reinforcement as the continual of behaviour to remove any aversive outcomes. Similarly, individuals might repeat the act of taking drugs because it temporarily removes their symptoms. Another concept of operant conditioning is positive reinforcement. This refers to the continual of behaviour to gain a reward. Drugs are involved in the activation of dopamine pathways. These pathways stimulate pleasure and reward thus might also explain why people continue to take drugs. Therefore, the dependent explanation can not alone explain substance use as a variety of factors and explanations might account for it.", "Hi <addr5_FN>, <nl><nl>The amount of vegetables consumed daily would be 1 also.<nl><nl>Best wishes,<nl><nl><part_FN><new>I have just spoken to the store manager regarding a <job_title> position and I have enclosed a copy of my CV.<nl>Kind regards,<nl><part_FN_SN>.<new>Hi <addr3_FN>,<nl><nl>I am emailing in regards to an email that I have received about a failure to submit a piece of assessment from my <module> module as part of my <course> undergraduate course.

{"id": "2f9d26df-437c-46ae-86e2-11ac96e82ac605064", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>This paper will examine whether there is a difference in how males and females use language when in the role of competition judge, and whether the formality of the situation has an impact. This study will focus on the politeness strategies used by each gender when critiquing the contestants. To achieve this, it will investigate the number of lines of speech, the use of positive as opposed to negative adjectives and the use of hedges or intensifiers. A hedge is a linguistic device used to mitigate a statement by lowering epistemic modality and directness with the goal of reducing the threat to face (Salager-Meyer, 1994; Brown and Levinson, 1978.) On the other hand, an intensifier is an adverb or adverbial phrase used to give emphasis (Bolinger, 1972). <nl>The data used in this study is from The Great British Bake Off (which will from here onwards be referred to as GBBO) and MasterChef: The Professionals, which will simply be referred to as MasterChef. These two programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions, but MasterChef features professional chefs and GBBO amateur bakers. There is also a difference in formality as GBBO is more informal and light-hearted which is shown by its two presenters both being comedians. On the other hand, MasterChef is more formal in tone and takes a more serious approach. <nl>This topic has been chosen as it combines politeness theories with gender theory in order to examine how they interact with each other, applying this to a competition environment. Both of the datasets are from television shows therefore it is important to take into account that they may be edited to portray people in a certain way or to best fulfil the main purpose of the shows, which is to entertain. It will be interesting to see how this artificial environment impacts the judges as they may be inclined to be more polite than usual in order to portray themselves well on television, or less polite if their career is based on them playing a \"villain\" role.<nl><nl>Research Background <nl>There has been much debate by linguistics over the relationship between gender and language and the effect the former has on the latter. One of the seminal theorists in this subject is Robin Lakoff (1975) who suggested that there are fundamental differences in how men and women use language. Most relevant to this paper was her identified differences in the use of polite forms, with women typically using more polite forms than men. Janet Holmes (2013) also agreed that women are more likely to use polite forms, although acknowledged that there are differences depending on factors such as the context of the interaction and the specific people involved. She argued that: <nl>\"when all the necessary reservations and qualifications have been taken into account, I think the answer is \u2018yes, women are more polite than men\u2019\" (Holmes, 1995: 5). <nl>It has also been suggested that women use more polite forms as they are more powerless than men (Deuchar, 1988). One theory that supports this is the dominance theory which investigated the number of interruptions between men and women in a mixed gender conversation (Zimmerman and West, 1975). The study found that men are much more likely to interrupt than women and across the eleven conversations they recorded women interrupted only twice whereas men interrupted 46 times. This supports the idea that women are more polite than men, however the study only has a small sample size of 35 participants, all of whom were from a similar background, and is over 45 years old. <nl>Looking more closely at politeness, it can be defined as a type of communication that shows respect and gives some benefit to the other communicators (Leech, 2014). It is an act which aims to maintain the other participants\u2019 positive and negative face (Goffman, 1967). <nl>Leech\u2019s politeness principle (1983) argues that speakers must follow six maxims in order to be considered polite. The theory builds on Grice\u2019s maxims of conversation (1975) but expands these maxim\u2019s and focuses them specifically on appearing polite. These maxims of politeness are; tact, generosity, approbation, modesty and agreement. This study will focus on the maxim of approbation, which involves maximising expressions of praise and approval and lessening the expressions of dispraise. <nl>In a recent study, these maxims were applied to high school students and their interactions with teachers in order to investigate how gender influences politeness (Ningsih et al., 2020). The study used a qualitive approach and gathered data through observations and recordings. They found that both male and female students adhered to the politeness principle more strongly with female teachers than with male teachers. This could suggest that how polite a speaker is depends on the gender of the person they are speaking to more than their own gender identification. Although this study looks only at the speaker and does not take into account the gender of the addressee, this could account for some of the patterns of politeness encountered and therefore is worth taking into consideration. <nl>Looking at this previous research, it could be expected that the female judges in this study will show more behaviours associated with politeness than the male judges, which will be shown through an increase of positive adjectives and a decrease of negative adjectives. It is also expected that the female judges will more often seek to minimise the amount of dispraise given and use hedges to save the hearer\u2019s positive face, whilst using more intensifiers to emphasise praise. It is also anticipated that males will dominate the conversation more, which could be seen as impolite as they allow less room in the conversation for the female judges to speak.<nl><nl>Methodology <nl>The data used in this investigation is from the final episode of the 2020 series of GBBO and the 2020 final of MasterChef. In each episode there are three contestants remaining and so, by using the first challenge they are given in each, there are three sets of comparable data for each show. Each judgement was then transcribed using the key in appendix one. The narration in MasterChef was excluded from the transcripts as it was edited in later and therefore was not part of the conversation being analysed. This analysis only focused on the judge\u2019s communication; however, the contestants and presenter\u2019s speech were included in the transcriptions for context. <nl>These programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions and so the type of praisecriticism given is comparable. However, the difference in tone and level of formality between the programmes allows a deeper investigation into the impact of context on politeness. It will be of interest to see whether the hypothesises are realised and whether the tone and formality of each programme impacts this, and if so to what extent. These programmes were also chosen as they have mixed gender judging panels thus the impact of gender can be observed. <nl>Once the data had been collected, it was analysed using a quantitative approach. The number of lines of speech by each of the judges was counted in each extract and placed into table one. In MasterChef there were three judges, two of which were male. In order to calculate the number of lines of speech for the males, the number for each judge was added together and then divided by two. Although this removes the influence of the individual, which is a disadvantage, it allows the proportion of speech by each gender to be directly compared, which for the purposes of this investigation was deemed more important. <nl>When counting the lines of speech, each line was counted as a whole regardless of the length. However, there is one result which contains a half due to the calculation used to find the average. Speech was also counted as one line if it was transcribed across two due to interruption but the utterance carried on unbroken. <nl>The use of adjectives was also counted and placed into a table (table two) and the context of the utterance was used to determine whether an adjective was used positively as praise, or negatively to criticise. The same method was then applied to the use of hedges and intensifiers, which were then discussed in a qualitative light to determine the effect they had on the overall politeness of each statement.<nl><nl>Findings <nl>i. Amount of speech by male and female judges <nl>The following table summarises the number of lines of speech made by male and female judges in each dataset. As there were two male judges in MasterChef the average number of lines of speech made between them has been used, as mentioned in the methodology. <nl><table><nl>Looking at GBBO first, on average the male judge (Paul) utters more lines of speech than the female judge (Prue). In the judgements of contestants one and three, Paul utters eight lines of speech as opposed to Prue\u2019s six lines, an increase of 28.57%. This is befitting the hypothesis that the male judge will speak more than the female judge, however the data featuring contestant two conflicts with this. In this instance, Prue has one more line of speech than Paul which is a 22.22% difference. Overall, Paul speaks more than Prue in two of the three extracts, and in there is a greater difference between the judges when Paul is the one speaking more. Across all three extracts Paul is shown to utter 16.22% more lines of speech than Prue, conforming to the expected results. <nl>Analysing the MasterChef results, the males (Gregg and Marcus) utter more lines of speech in the judgements of contestants one and two than the female judge (Monica). In the transcript featuring contestant one there is a 40% difference in the number of utterances, and in the next there is a 22.22% difference. This is a greater increase in the amount of speech by males as opposed to females than was seen in GBBO. Yet, when the judgement of contestant three is analysed, the largest difference in speech of all the transcripts is shown with Monica speaking 66.67% more lines than the male judges. This means that overall, there is only a 3.39% difference between the male and female judges, with the female judge having uttered more lines in total. This disagrees with the hypothesis that men would talk more but the difference in utterance of lines is minimal. <nl>To conclude, the data from GBBO is in accordance with the hypothesis made that males will utter more lines of speech than females, but the data from MasterChef contradicts it. There are a few possible explanations for why this might have occurred. One explanation is the difference in tone between the two shows; In MasterChef the setting is more formal and professional whereas GBBO is a more informal setting where the judges interact with the contestants more colloquially. Therefore, GBBO mirrors normal conversations more than MasterChef and the context relates more closely to that of the studies researched for this paper. There is also a difference in the way the programmes are formatted. The judgement in GBBO is more like a conversation in the first challenge, so there are examples of turn-taking within the conversation. In contrast, on MasterChef the judges speak one at a time in longer instances and there are no conversations between them. This could influence the results as it means the participants are not dominating the conversation but rather giving a longer individual monologue. <nl>It is also of note that the extracts transcribed are only a couple of minutes long and therefore there is only a relatively small amount of data. In a longer conversation there is a possibility that the difference between male and female speech could become more defined.<nl><nl>ii. Use of adjectives <nl>When categorising the use of adjectives into positive or negative classifications, the context of the sentence was used to determine what category was most appropriate. They were then collated into the table below. <nl><table><nl>For example, \"wobbly\" was classed as a positive adjective as it was used in the utterance \"I like the wobbly lines\" (Appendix three, lines 20-22). <nl>Analysing the use of adjectives by the GBBO judges, Prue used more positive adjectives with each contestant as well as a greater range of adjectives. Looking at the use of negative adjectives, both judges used a similar number however Paul used one more. Therefore, the GBBO data aligns with the hypothesis that the female judge would use more adjectives that signal praise, and the male more negative adjectives. <nl>When comparing this to the results for the MasterChef data, Monica used an equal number of negative adjectives as Marcus, and one more than Gregg who did not use any. This contradicts the hypothesis and suggests that Monica is more willing to risk threatening the contestants face than Gregg, who only uses compliments. When judging the first contestant, Gregg used seven times as many adjectives to give praise than Monica did, and more than twice as many as Marcus. With the next contestant all three judges used the same number of positive adjectives and with the final contestant Monica used the most; using four times as many as Gregg and twice as many as Marcus. Ranking the judges based on their use of positive minus negative adjectives, Marcus and Monica both ranked the same and Gregg ranked highest meaning he is most concerned with politeness and least willing to flout the maxim of approbation. In summary, the data from MasterChef does not support the hypothesis and contrasts with the GBBO results. <nl><nl>iii. Use of hedges and intensifiers <nl>Within this table a colour-coding system has been using to differentiate between the hedges and intensifiers that have been used in relation to negative statements, and those that have been used positively. Text in green represents the words and phrases that have be used in relation to praise, and red has been used for text that relates to dispraise or criticism. <nl><table><nl>The intensifier \"very very\" was kept as one phrase within the table rather than two instances of the word \"very\" to emphasise how strongly the praise was given. <nl>The results from the analysis on hedging and intensifiers is similar to the patterns seen when investigating the use of adjectives. In the GBBO data, Prue used more positively associated hedges and intensifiers and fewer negative ones than Paul. <nl>Similarly, in the MasterChef data Gregg did not use any negative forms of these linguistic features which correlates with his use of adjectives. Although Marcus used more negative forms of the features than Monica, he also used more positive forms therefore showing they have an equal level of politeness as shown with their use of adjectives. <nl>Overall, this section again confirms that the judges in GBBO conform to the ideas of gender and politeness, whereas the judges in MasterChef do not. This could be down to the individual\u2019s character, as the social constructivist theory suggests that gender is only one part of our identity that influences communication; Personality, status, level of education and ethnicity also all serve to shape our communication (Burr, 2015). It suggests that people make each element of this construction relevant or irrelevant as is necessary. This suggests that Monica and Gregg could be choosing not to make their gender relevant to their role as judge, and each is relying on other factors to influence their use of praise instead. <nl><nl>Discussion <nl>One section that is particularly interesting is where Paul and Prue discussed the issues with Dave\u2019s custard slice in the GGBO. In the extract below, both judges use a mixture of hedges and praise to try and soften their criticism of Dave and minimise their flouting of the maxim of approbation. <nl><data_extract><nl>In cooking the adjective \"strong\" can be both positive or negative. In this extract Prue signals that she is using it positively by her use of the phrase \"I love the coffee\" before describing it as strong, thereby using it to praise Dave. The use of the intensifier \"really\" emphasises the strength of the flavour which adds to this praise. This extract also features the word \"stodgy\" three times. In the first instance, Paul used it to criticise Dave\u2019s custard which is an example of a positive face threatening act. However, Paul lessens the impact of the criticism by using the hedging phrase \"a little bit\" therefore minimising the expression of dispraise as laid out in Leech\u2019s maxim of approbation (1983). Prue then repeats this criticism however she uses the adjective \"stodgy\" twice with an emphasis on the first time. In this instance she is using the first expression of stodgy as a hedge to minimise the impact of the second expression, hereby implying it is not as bad as it could be and is only minorly stodgy. Again, this helps to minimise the impoliteness and helps to save face. \"Pretty\" is also used as a hedge in this extract, which lessens the compliment of it being \"delicious\". The use of the adverb \"still\" serves to further lessen it, so although Prue is paying a compliment, she is still acknowledging that the baking has flaws. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, the hypothesises that female judges would use more language concerned with politeness were realised to a certain extent. The patterns of communication shown by the GBBO judges did match up with what was expected, however the judges in MasterChef conformed to these expectations to a much lesser extent. This could be due to the formality of the show as opposed to the more colloquial nature of The Great British Bake Off, although it could also be due to the individual backgrounds and personalities of each judge. There is also a possibility that the gender of the contestant being judged has an impact on how the judges use politeness. Future research could investigate further by looking at a greater range of programmes and including more data for each. There is also an age difference of 35 years between the two female judges so it could be interesting to investigate deeper into how the changes in society between these years have influenced how women use language in reference to politeness.", "Hi, <nl><nl><nl>Here's a copy of my CV, I would be grateful for any feedback you can provide.<nl><nl><nl>Kind Regards,<nl><nl><nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hi,<nl><nl>I was wondering, if it's not too late, could I move my <module> Seminar?<nl>I am currently timetabled for 9am on a <day>, but would prefer to be in the 1pm group on a <day>.

Lastly, another cognitive change that is observed is that the individuals affected by PTSD may lose interest in activities or avoid participating in them. These might be the activities that they enjoyed before the event occurred. <nl><nl>One of the biological changes observed is that the hippocampus is significantly smaller in individuals who develop PTSD. This region of the brain plays a role in memories related to emotion, therefore a smaller hippocampus represents a higher risk for developing PTSD after a traumatic event (Gilbertson 2002). Another biological change that is observed is the failure of the brain centres (e.g ventromedial frontal cortex) which dampens the activation of the brain's fear coordinating centre, the amygdala (Koenigs &amp; Grafman 2009). Therefore, the individual is unable to control the activation of fear after trauma."]}

Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001).", "Erm, so, in the first picture, I can see two young ladies, erm, er, one in stripy black and white top with blonde hair.

{"id": "7c7dea4a-95c1-41a6-957d-628ed14dfc9a05548", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Aims and Research Questions<nl>The lockdown amidst COVID-19 has made significant disruptions in academic activities. In this lockdown period, it was reported that learners were mostly suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety (42.0%) (Kapasia, N., Paul, P., Roy, A., Saha, J., Zaveri, A., Mallick, R., ... &amp; Chouhan, P. 2020). The negative impact on student mental and physical well-being due to lockdown restrictions, may be seen as detrimental for their academia and overall performance. Other research has been carried out on the wider population, not students specifically, however the COVID-19 lockdown can be seen to affect others negatively, in terms of mental health. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderatesevere insomnia (Gualano, M. R., Lo Moro, G., Voglino, G., Bert, F., &amp; Siliquini, R. 2020). However, research on the wider student experience during COVID-19 in the UK lacks exposure, so the given indication to the gap, conducting this research could be beneficial to raise greater awareness to the subject.<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as the chosen method<nl>IPA is concerned with lived experience. Experience covers quite a lot of territory (Cooper, H. E., Camic, P. M., Long, D. L., Panter, A. T., Rindskopf, D. E., &amp; Sher, K. J. 2012). Furthermore, IPA focuses on the detailed examination of particulars, first providing an in-depth account of each case before moving to look for patterning\u2019s of convergence and divergence across cases (Eatough, V., &amp; Smith, J. A. 2008).  This method allows the researcher to analyse and understand an individual\u2019s experience towards a certain event \u2013 which in this case would be the global pandemic and how it has affected students: it allows us to explore different aspects that may have been impacted and gives us the chance to begin to comprehend those experiences. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>1. \"Feels like a waste of a university experience\"; a student who has been affected by the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>Missing out on experiences and opportunities as a university student, is a main theme in this account - which includes spending time with friends, enjoying the nightlife, parties and academic events (e.g. lectures and seminars). Natasha draws up on the fact that the university experience she is currently having is very different to what she had prior to the COVID-19 restrictions in her first year. Although, she highlights that she had been able to enjoy some of the perks of being a student in her first year of study, she emphasises the lack of it now and realises that she had taken for granted some of the opportunities she had in first year, as she states - \"I definitely should have taken those erm (.) opportunities and just spend it with the people I like being around\". This may highlight the idea that Natasha feels regret because certain experiences are not as readily available as they were before.<nl>1.1 \"I\u2019m not seeing my friends as often as I would do... I\u2019m not going out\": the negatives highlighted due to the lockdown. <nl>Natasha was asked to compare her first year to her current year of university, and the main focus had been that there is a lack of opportunity to go out with friends - to restaurants, clubs and parties: all of which have been impacted significantly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. Further down in the interview she once again emphasises the fact that she yearns for a greater chance to go out to social events: \"I really do miss going out with them and seeing them and spending time with them\". It may suggest that Natasha, who is already limited by the distance from university to her hometown and who may have relied on interaction from social events at university, has been severely impacted and may go on to feel \"lonely\" within these circumstances, as she had previously mentioned when asked who she was able to communicate with at the moment. <nl><nl>There is no doubt that one of the main disadvantages Natasha focuses on is the idea that her personality is hindered by the lockdown: \"there is a lot of downsides...one of the things I love the most like going out, seeing my friends\", she draws attention to this significant piece missing in her life and emphasises how much she enjoys going out and seeing my friends by using the word \"love\". Due to the restrictions there may be an imbalance of work and leisure, Natasha may feel as though she is trapped in unhappiness during this global pandemic. <nl>1.2 \"...I\u2019ve not met anyone new on my course which is a bit upsetting\": the lack of engagement due to face-to-face teaching being moved online. <nl>When Natasha was asked: \"How they get along with engaging with other students\" - the response steered in a direction where she expressed a disappointment in the lack of opportunity to meet new course mates. She stated this a couple of times whilst answering this question: \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\", which may indicate that she has been deeply affected by the fact that the opportunity to engage with other students has been stripped away.<nl>University can be advertised amongst students as being a place where there is a chance to meet many different people - however, the outlook has changed significantly as those opportunities have been limited due to the restrictions; \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\" - Natasha emphasises that university no longer serves the purpose of networking and meeting new people because of social distancing.<nl><nl>2.0 \"...detached mentally from my studies\": recognising the lack of motivation.<nl>Main theme in this segment is how Natasha highlights the depletion of her mental well-being towards her studies and daily life. The lack of face-to-face teaching seems to be the reason for this, as further down the interview she mentions - \"I don\u2019t feel like a uni student (.) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m mentally there so my motivation has decreased signi-significantly\" which further supports the idea that the restrictions are detrimental to university students - due to the vast amount of lectures being moved online. This mentality and decrease of motivation may indicate a severe impact towards Natasha\u2019s mental health and well-being during this period of time. However, this could also be catastrophic for her university grades, as the lack of motivation may hinder the quality of her work and may lead her to underachieve. <nl><nl>2.1 \"...my mind is always in autopilot\": there is a lack of conscious control. <nl>Natasha goes on to use this phrase to describe her consciousness during the days in lockdown. This may emphasise the idea that her time spent in lockdown is constant and uneventful leading her to lose conscious awareness of what she is doing. The use of the word \"autopilot\" underlines the fact that she is aware that she is mentally detached from her life due to the sudden societal changes from the virus. On the other hand, it can be implied that she is comparing herself to that of a machine - where she is constantly stuck in a pattern doing the same thing daily.<nl>She goes on to mention that her \"days kinda merge into one\"- and further explains that she finds it easy to \"lose track\" of what she is doing and what she \"should be doing\",  which may lead to imply that lockdown has had both mental and physical obstacles, that Natasha has encountered and finds it difficult to plan her days and keep to a schedule. The use of the strong verb \"merge\" accentuates the difficulty Natasha is having to distinguish the days as they go by, possibly creating a blurred sense of reality whilst living with the restrictions.<nl><nl>2.2 \"spend the whole day in bed and its really taking a toll on me mentally\": is showing traits of a mental health disorder due to the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>When Natasha was asked how her daily life had changed, she proceeded to emphasise that the gym after the first lockdown, had allowed her to make progress \"mentally and physically\". However, the gyms were forced to close again following the second national lockdown. This proved to be a significant impact for Natasha \u2013 as further down in the answer she stated that she would \"spend the whole day in bed\". This may suggest that she may have been experiencing a mental health related disorder which could have been onset due to the second lockdown. This may portray the risk that the restrictions have towards the well-being of students. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, Natasha has had a wide range of negative changes and experiences whilst being a university student during the global pandemic\u2013 most aspects do relate to the new introduction of social distancing: which has proven to be a big change for her as she thrives of socialising and meeting new people. Natasha who has moved out from their hometown and is now situated in the city where she attends university is likely to feel lonely due to not being around friends or family. The decline in mental health has been evident \u2013 towards both her studies and daily life in general. Natasha finds it hard to live in the present and feels mentally absent on some days. This may indicate that being a student during the global pandemic is detrimental for individuals such as Natasha; leading to unhappiness, loneliness, disappointment, decline in mental health and being unmotivated.

Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop.

This might include an increase in negative emotions and the inability to experience positive ones. For instance, if a woman was sexually abused, she might experience anxiety or fear even after her abuse. A second cognitive change might be a severe lack of interest in activities. The women might have enjoyed spending time with her friends prior to her abuse but after the abuse she might resist and avoid any involvement in activities that were once pleasurable to her. She may also blame herself for getting sexually abused. Her choice of wearing a scandalous outfit might justify why someone abused her and this would be another cognitive change.<nl><nl>There are also biological changes associated with PTSD. The amygdala is responsible for the perception of emotions and the ventromedial frontal cortex is responsible for regulating responses to emotions. However, the frontal region with those who have PTSD does not function effectively and it does not dampen down the amygdala to the same degree as it does with people without the disorder. Another biological change may be a decrease in the size of the hippocampus, and this might explain why people with PTSD have difficulties consolidating their memories.<nl><nl><nl>Question 2: Outline the proposed role of operant conditioning in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).  How would a behavioural therapist treat OCD? (Both parts of this question are equally weighted). <nl><nl>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is made up of two components, obsessions and compulsions. The compulsion refers to the repetitive behaviour, for example, suffers may regularly wash their hands to reduce anxiety. The anxiety is caused by obsessive, irrational thoughts for example, the constant fear of germs and bacteria. According to the second stage of Mowrer\u2019s (1947) two stage theory, the removal of an aversive stimulus will negatively reinforce behaviour. In other words, the removal of anxiety is caused by the compulsive acts of washing hands \u2013 negative reinforcement and the relief from the anxiety might be rewarding to a sufferer \u2013 positive reinforcement. Thus, the behaviour will perpetuate because it is both negatively and positively reinforced.<nl><nl>Behavioural therapists treat OCD using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT involves the therapist and sufferer to actively break down and challenge irrational thoughts and behaviours through exposure and response prevention (ERP). This involves the gradual exposure to the feared object, this might be a fear of dirt and individuals are counter conditioned to learn new ways to control their compulsive behaviours around the fear. Once the fear is mastered, they will adopt these changes into their daily routine and try overcome their disorder.<nl><nl>Section B<nl>Critically evaluate the concept of dependence as an explanation for substance use.<nl>Dependence is an explanation for substance use and it refers to the need for drugs in order to function and in absence of the drugs, individuals may display withdrawal symptoms. There are two types of dependence, physical and mental. Mental dependence is when the use of a substance leads to a conditioned response to an emotion or feeling. For example, someone suffering from depression might rely heavily on benzodiazepines to evoke positive emotions such as relaxation and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, this could lead to drug misuse and the dependence explanation has helped lead to practical applications to avoid this occurring. For instance, doctors will prescribe benzodiazepines only in serious cases and for less than 4 weeks to avoid dependencyaddiction. This explanation has led to a greater understanding about drugs and positive social changes.<nl><nl>The dependence explanation is limited however, because substance use could also be a result of genetic predispositions. Kendler &amp; Prescott (1998) support this notion through their research on 1,934 twins, ranging in age from 22 to 62. They were given interviews about their drug addictions to cocaine and marijuana. Kendler reported that whilst examining pairs, it was evident that the concordance rates for both twins using drugs was higher in monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ) twins. The concordance rate for cocaine use in MZ twins was 54% and in DZ twins it was 42%. Thus, this gives weight to the influence of genetics on substance use. While it is important to understand the role of heredity on substance use, environmental factors are also as important. These factors may include stress, trauma, or community pressure. Exposure to trauma has been linked closely to substance use. Witnessing death or experiencing assault would be a traumatic experience and these people are more likely to take drugs. This may be because trauma symptoms may become more manageable after self-medicating. Turning to drugs may be the easier escape for some individuals when dealing with environmental difficulties. Thus, substance use may be a result of genetic and environmental factors interacting so therefore, a diathesis stress model should be proposed.<nl><nl>Behaviourists stress the important role operant conditioning has on behaviour. Operant conditioning as proposed by Skinner (1938) can be applied to substance use. For instance, people suffering from trauma may use drugs as a coping mechanism to alleviate their trauma related symptoms (this might include shocks and mood swings). Skinner referred to negative reinforcement as the continual of behaviour to remove any aversive outcomes. Similarly, individuals might repeat the act of taking drugs because it temporarily removes their symptoms. Another concept of operant conditioning is positive reinforcement. This refers to the continual of behaviour to gain a reward. Drugs are involved in the activation of dopamine pathways. These pathways stimulate pleasure and reward thus might also explain why people continue to take drugs. Therefore, the dependent explanation can not alone explain substance use as a variety of factors and explanations might account for it.", "Er, so image one is there\u2019s two females and one of them has blonde hair and she\u2019s white, and she has stripy tee shirt, black and white.

Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1.

It is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued left than when cued right. Data from 38 participants was used. Within-subjects design. Independent variable had two levels: cue left, cue right. Dependant variable was the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V). EEG electrodes were attached to relevant areas using the 1020 system. The results showed that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions. The results are consistent with the hypothesis and previous research.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>The alpha inhibition hypothesis refers to the concept that high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha wave in the relaxation state has higher power spectrum than in the attention state. Yaomanee, K., Pan-ngum, S., &amp; Ayuthaya, P. I. N. (2012). Concluding that alpha activity can be modulated by attention, thus meaning that alpha activity is reduced when we pay attention to stimuli.<nl>This experiment is a partial replication of Sauseng et al., (2005). Overall, 22 participants used, and they were given a cued visual attention task. Cued with a fixation cross for 34ms, then an arrow cue would indicate which hemifield a target would appear in. There was a 50% chance of being cued left or right, 75% of the trials were valid and 25% of trials were invalid. Results indicated that parietal regions showed stronger alpha lower band frequency suppression contralateral to the attended hemifield. Similar results for upper frequencies. Therefore, the alpha inhibition hypothesis is supported by these findings as there is stronger alpha activity in the task irrelevant brain areas. <nl>To further support these findings, Mazahari et al., (2014) used 57 adolescent participants: 23 normally developing, 17 who have combined subtype ADHD (inattention and hyperactivity) and 17 who have predominantly inattentive ADHD. Used a cued flanker task. Response preparation cue predicted 84% accuracy, or a null cue was shown which had no information about correct response. Overall participants showed alpha suppression following response preparation cues, greater for normally developing participants and least for inattentive ADHD subtypes. The indicative alpha suppression supports the idea that alpha activity can be modulated by attention \u2013 thus being reduced when participants attended to the stimuli.<nl>Following on previous studies, it is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued to expect a stimulus on the left than when cued to expect a stimulus on the right, when recording from the left parietal lobe (P3).  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>To begin with, 39 undergraduate participants were obtained by volunteer sample, however, one participant was removed as they were only available for one of the two conditions: 38 participants overall. <nl>Design <nl>Within subject\u2019s design, with an independent variable of cue direction with two levels: either left or right. The dependent variable is the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V).<nl><nl>Materials <nl>A Biopac MP36 was used to record alpha range activity and receive event markers for cue left and cue right conditions. EEG electrodes which were attached to the head. AC Cream and Everi cream was used, in preparation prior to the attachment of electrodes. The software PsychoPy was used to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. Stimuli were used to present to the visual fields such as: arrow cues left (&lt;) and right (&gt;), large bar (Figure A) and small bar (Figure B) stimuli. <nl><figure><nl> <nl>Procedure <nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz. Digital channels were set up to receive the event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker. A calculation channel was also set up to record the activity in the alpha frequency range of (8 - 13 Hz). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. <nl>Before preparing the participants, they gave informed consent and were briefed on their right to withdraw from the experiment. To prepare the participants for electrode placement, Everi cream was used to abrase the areas P3, Fz and forehead, selected using the 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Techologies, 2012). The AC cream was then applied on the electrodes: an active electrode was attached to P3. Reference electrodes are attached at Fz. Earth electrodes were attached to the forehead, near the hairline. The impedance levels were checked to be below 10Kohms.  <nl>Participants were given instructions and a practice trial first and were cued with an arrow for 35ms to let participants know which side to expect a stimulus, with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) set to 600ms-800ms in the practice trial. Different event markers were sent at stimulus onset for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli consisted of either large or small white bars shown either left or right on the screen on a black background for 50ms. The participants respond with either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. They underwent 12 practice trials including feedback about their response, before undergoing 4 blocks of 20 trials. After the practice trail was complete, the participants were given feedback on their performance.<nl>The participants were shortly warned that the real experiment was about to start. The random ISI was set to 200ms-1200ms<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>To covert the raw 9-13 Hz Alpha EEG to averaged data. Event markers from PsychoPy were sent to identify when stimuli were presented. Then looked at the period 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown. The data was rectified, which turns the negative values into positive, in order to show alpha activity regardless of it being excitatory or inhibitory. Averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of the outlying or extreme values. The rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were then suitable for statistical analysis. <nl>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics<nl>Firstly, to determine whether the data is parametric, a Shapiro-Wilk test was used and p&lt;.005. The p value is less than .05, therefore, a non-parametric equivalent had to be used: <nl>Wilcoxon signed ranks test. <nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions and a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed this difference was significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were consistent with the predicted hypothesis, as the median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left, than cue right and this supports the idea that alpha activity at P3 is different depending on which side participants are cued to expect a stimulus. <nl>The results also support previous research and the alpha inhibition hypothesis, as high alpha shows the inhibition of task irrelevant areas due to more activity in the left hemisphere (Klimesch et al., 2007), on the ipsilateral side of where the cue was presented. <nl>Although the results are consistent with the hypothesis, confounding variables may have altered the data to an extent. The participants moving around, may have altered the validity as gross motor movements may contaminate the EEG recordings, (Bell, M. A., &amp; Cuevas, K., 2012).<nl>Overall, there may be some areas for improvement to prevent confounding variables from affecting the data. To prevent motor movements, the participants should be given strict instructions to follow due to the sensitivity of the EEG. The researchers should monitor the participants to check if those instructions are being followed. However, despite these issues, the results can be granted as valid as the correct procedures were taken during the experiment, such as ensuring the impedance levels were below 10Kohms and in addition the results were expected due to previous research.", "Hi, <nl><nl>Fab!

This might include an increase in negative emotions and the inability to experience positive ones. For instance, if a woman was sexually abused, she might experience anxiety or fear even after her abuse. A second cognitive change might be a severe lack of interest in activities. The women might have enjoyed spending time with her friends prior to her abuse but after the abuse she might resist and avoid any involvement in activities that were once pleasurable to her. She may also blame herself for getting sexually abused. Her choice of wearing a scandalous outfit might justify why someone abused her and this would be another cognitive change.<nl><nl>There are also biological changes associated with PTSD. The amygdala is responsible for the perception of emotions and the ventromedial frontal cortex is responsible for regulating responses to emotions. However, the frontal region with those who have PTSD does not function effectively and it does not dampen down the amygdala to the same degree as it does with people without the disorder. Another biological change may be a decrease in the size of the hippocampus, and this might explain why people with PTSD have difficulties consolidating their memories.<nl><nl><nl>Question 2: Outline the proposed role of operant conditioning in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).  How would a behavioural therapist treat OCD? (Both parts of this question are equally weighted). <nl><nl>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is made up of two components, obsessions and compulsions. The compulsion refers to the repetitive behaviour, for example, suffers may regularly wash their hands to reduce anxiety. The anxiety is caused by obsessive, irrational thoughts for example, the constant fear of germs and bacteria. According to the second stage of Mowrer\u2019s (1947) two stage theory, the removal of an aversive stimulus will negatively reinforce behaviour. In other words, the removal of anxiety is caused by the compulsive acts of washing hands \u2013 negative reinforcement and the relief from the anxiety might be rewarding to a sufferer \u2013 positive reinforcement. Thus, the behaviour will perpetuate because it is both negatively and positively reinforced.<nl><nl>Behavioural therapists treat OCD using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT involves the therapist and sufferer to actively break down and challenge irrational thoughts and behaviours through exposure and response prevention (ERP). This involves the gradual exposure to the feared object, this might be a fear of dirt and individuals are counter conditioned to learn new ways to control their compulsive behaviours around the fear. Once the fear is mastered, they will adopt these changes into their daily routine and try overcome their disorder.<nl><nl>Section B<nl>Critically evaluate the concept of dependence as an explanation for substance use.<nl>Dependence is an explanation for substance use and it refers to the need for drugs in order to function and in absence of the drugs, individuals may display withdrawal symptoms. There are two types of dependence, physical and mental. Mental dependence is when the use of a substance leads to a conditioned response to an emotion or feeling. For example, someone suffering from depression might rely heavily on benzodiazepines to evoke positive emotions such as relaxation and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, this could lead to drug misuse and the dependence explanation has helped lead to practical applications to avoid this occurring. For instance, doctors will prescribe benzodiazepines only in serious cases and for less than 4 weeks to avoid dependencyaddiction. This explanation has led to a greater understanding about drugs and positive social changes.<nl><nl>The dependence explanation is limited however, because substance use could also be a result of genetic predispositions. Kendler &amp; Prescott (1998) support this notion through their research on 1,934 twins, ranging in age from 22 to 62. They were given interviews about their drug addictions to cocaine and marijuana. Kendler reported that whilst examining pairs, it was evident that the concordance rates for both twins using drugs was higher in monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ) twins. The concordance rate for cocaine use in MZ twins was 54% and in DZ twins it was 42%. Thus, this gives weight to the influence of genetics on substance use. While it is important to understand the role of heredity on substance use, environmental factors are also as important. These factors may include stress, trauma, or community pressure. Exposure to trauma has been linked closely to substance use. Witnessing death or experiencing assault would be a traumatic experience and these people are more likely to take drugs. This may be because trauma symptoms may become more manageable after self-medicating. Turning to drugs may be the easier escape for some individuals when dealing with environmental difficulties. Thus, substance use may be a result of genetic and environmental factors interacting so therefore, a diathesis stress model should be proposed.<nl><nl>Behaviourists stress the important role operant conditioning has on behaviour. Operant conditioning as proposed by Skinner (1938) can be applied to substance use. For instance, people suffering from trauma may use drugs as a coping mechanism to alleviate their trauma related symptoms (this might include shocks and mood swings). Skinner referred to negative reinforcement as the continual of behaviour to remove any aversive outcomes. Similarly, individuals might repeat the act of taking drugs because it temporarily removes their symptoms. Another concept of operant conditioning is positive reinforcement. This refers to the continual of behaviour to gain a reward. Drugs are involved in the activation of dopamine pathways. These pathways stimulate pleasure and reward thus might also explain why people continue to take drugs. Therefore, the dependent explanation can not alone explain substance use as a variety of factors and explanations might account for it.", "I\u2019d be doing that.

Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent (CI) than the colour congruent (CC) condition. (M= 966.8, SD= 405.1). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( T= 403, n= 59, p= &lt; .001). Data shows that participants took longer to correctly identify the font colours when they were incongruent with the colour of the words written. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>The results that were found were consistent with previous research of Stroop (1935) and supported the hypothesis as participants did have a slower reaction time when identifying incongruent font colours and had a faster reaction time for the congruent condition. The reaction time was faster for the congruent condition because Cattell (1886) argued that wording reading is automatic therefore it\u2019s quicker for individuals to read the word represented to them in that condition. However, different research finding has been reported from a similar stroop task called emotional stroop (Williams et al. 1996). It was found that the emotional Stroop involves only emotional and neutral words and that color does not affect reaction time because it does not conflict with word meaning. The classic stroop test shows that the reaction time is slower because there is a conflict between an incongruent color and the word. Furthermore,  Salthouse and Meinz (1995) argue that even though age differences specific to stroop interference were minimal, other research may show the relationship between age and Stroop interference was still significant (West &amp; Baylis, 1998). <nl><nl>Finally, some of the methodological issues regarding the experiment were that volunteer sampling was used, only university students participated. Findings cannot be generalised to those who did not volunteer and the finding may not be representative of the whole population. An improvement could be made by selecting people of all ages not just university students. Another issue was that the experiment was not completed in a controlled environment, this means they could have had help from others. Another improvement could be that all the participants complete the test in a psychology lab. Also there may have been extraneous variables which may have affected the results, e.g. some participants may have completed at 9am, they would most likely been tired and have had a slower reaction time. This can be improved by making sure all students complete the test at the same time."]}

One is standing up and leaning over a little bit. She is wearing a black and white stripey t-shirt and some jeans, and then sat down next to her is another girl in a leather jacket \u2013 not a leather jacket, a denim jacket. Erm, she, the girl sitting down, is laughing. And the woman standing up is smiling a little bit, but she\u2019s not looking directly at her. Erm, maybe they\u2019re looking at something together, but that\u2019s not in the picture. The picture is just the girls. The background is just plain white. Erm, there might be some shapes underneath it, I can\u2019t really see. But for the most part it\u2019s either white or blocked out, so the focus of the picture is the girls. Erm, they look like maybe they\u2019re friends or maybe they\u2019re in a study group together, like they could be students. They look about student age. I\u2019d say like early twenties kind of age. And yeah, that\u2019s the first image. The second picture has got two boys in it, and the fo- the main, at the front of the picture is a laptop, is an Apple MacBook. Erm, and the background is, I think they\u2019re in like a study booth, maybe. Erm, there\u2019s a table at the front, and then the back is like black with green spots on it, different sizes, dots. And then one of the boys is wearing a t-shirt with flowers on it and pink writing, and he\u2019s got an earring in. And the other boy is wearing like a, I think it\u2019s like plaid or flannel, or whatever, a shirt over a white t-shirt. And he is looking at the laptop, and the other boy is looking at him. Again, I think students, in probably a study session. I think they might be in a study group together. They both ar- they seem happy to be there,  <laugh>  I don\u2019t know, kind of not outwardly smiling but a bit of a smile. Erm, seems like they get on, but I don\u2019t know if I would say, they don\u2019t really look like best friends I would say. So maybe they\u2019ve met in a study group, or maybe they\u2019re just acquaintances, I don\u2019t know.

Erm, they, there\u2019s a table at the front, like a glass table, and they\u2019re both sat, there are two people in it, both sat on a bench, I think? Erm, sorry, this one\u2019s a boy and a girl. The boy is holding a textbook and he\u2019s got a coat on, and some, I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s, I don\u2019t know.

She is wearing a black and white stripey t-shirt and some jeans, and then sat down next to her is another girl in a leather jacket \u2013 not a leather jacket, a denim jacket. Erm, she, the girl sitting down, is laughing. And the woman standing up is smiling a little bit, but she\u2019s not looking directly at her. Erm, maybe they\u2019re looking at something together, but that\u2019s not in the picture. The picture is just the girls. The background is just plain white. Erm, there might be some shapes underneath it, I can\u2019t really see. But for the most part it\u2019s either white or blocked out, so the focus of the picture is the girls. Erm, they look like maybe they\u2019re friends or maybe they\u2019re in a study group together, like they could be students. They look about student age. I\u2019d say like early twenties kind of age. And yeah, that\u2019s the first image. The second picture has got two boys in it, and the fo- the main, at the front of the picture is a laptop, is an Apple MacBook. Erm, and the background is, I think they\u2019re in like a study booth, maybe. Erm, there\u2019s a table at the front, and then the back is like black with green spots on it, different sizes, dots. And then one of the boys is wearing a t-shirt with flowers on it and pink writing, and he\u2019s got an earring in. And the other boy is wearing like a, I think it\u2019s like plaid or flannel, or whatever, a shirt over a white t-shirt. And he is looking at the laptop, and the other boy is looking at him. Again, I think students, in probably a study session. I think they might be in a study group together. They both ar- they seem happy to be there,  <laugh>  I don\u2019t know, kind of not outwardly smiling but a bit of a smile. Erm, seems like they get on, but I don\u2019t know if I would say, they don\u2019t really look like best friends I would say. So maybe they\u2019ve met in a study group, or maybe they\u2019re just acquaintances, I don\u2019t know. And then the third picture is, I guess again might be a study situation, because there\u2019s a boy in it holding a book that looks, it\u2019s quite a thick book, so maybe a textbook. Erm, they, there\u2019s a table at the front, like a glass table, and they\u2019re both sat, there are two people in it, both sat on a bench, I think? Erm, sorry, this one\u2019s a boy and a girl. The boy is holding a textbook and he\u2019s got a coat on, and some, I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s, I don\u2019t know. The girl has got her leather jacket on and some boots, and the background is, erm, is black with white dots making up the circle, and then a bigger circle, bigger circle, etc., etc. Erm, and maybe like I said also in a study session, erm, kind of setting, like students.

{"id": "163d1db3-d78f-46b6-a95b-7969c3f4e70603408", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Aims and Research Questions<nl>The lockdown amidst COVID-19 has made significant disruptions in academic activities. In this lockdown period, it was reported that learners were mostly suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety (42.0%) (Kapasia, N., Paul, P., Roy, A., Saha, J., Zaveri, A., Mallick, R., ... &amp; Chouhan, P. 2020). The negative impact on student mental and physical well-being due to lockdown restrictions, may be seen as detrimental for their academia and overall performance. Other research has been carried out on the wider population, not students specifically, however the COVID-19 lockdown can be seen to affect others negatively, in terms of mental health. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderatesevere insomnia (Gualano, M. R., Lo Moro, G., Voglino, G., Bert, F., &amp; Siliquini, R. 2020). However, research on the wider student experience during COVID-19 in the UK lacks exposure, so the given indication to the gap, conducting this research could be beneficial to raise greater awareness to the subject.<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as the chosen method<nl>IPA is concerned with lived experience. Experience covers quite a lot of territory (Cooper, H. E., Camic, P. M., Long, D. L., Panter, A. T., Rindskopf, D. E., &amp; Sher, K. J. 2012). Furthermore, IPA focuses on the detailed examination of particulars, first providing an in-depth account of each case before moving to look for patterning\u2019s of convergence and divergence across cases (Eatough, V., &amp; Smith, J. A. 2008).  This method allows the researcher to analyse and understand an individual\u2019s experience towards a certain event \u2013 which in this case would be the global pandemic and how it has affected students: it allows us to explore different aspects that may have been impacted and gives us the chance to begin to comprehend those experiences. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>1. \"Feels like a waste of a university experience\"; a student who has been affected by the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>Missing out on experiences and opportunities as a university student, is a main theme in this account - which includes spending time with friends, enjoying the nightlife, parties and academic events (e.g. lectures and seminars). Natasha draws up on the fact that the university experience she is currently having is very different to what she had prior to the COVID-19 restrictions in her first year. Although, she highlights that she had been able to enjoy some of the perks of being a student in her first year of study, she emphasises the lack of it now and realises that she had taken for granted some of the opportunities she had in first year, as she states - \"I definitely should have taken those erm (.) opportunities and just spend it with the people I like being around\". This may highlight the idea that Natasha feels regret because certain experiences are not as readily available as they were before.<nl>1.1 \"I\u2019m not seeing my friends as often as I would do... I\u2019m not going out\": the negatives highlighted due to the lockdown. <nl>Natasha was asked to compare her first year to her current year of university, and the main focus had been that there is a lack of opportunity to go out with friends - to restaurants, clubs and parties: all of which have been impacted significantly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. Further down in the interview she once again emphasises the fact that she yearns for a greater chance to go out to social events: \"I really do miss going out with them and seeing them and spending time with them\". It may suggest that Natasha, who is already limited by the distance from university to her hometown and who may have relied on interaction from social events at university, has been severely impacted and may go on to feel \"lonely\" within these circumstances, as she had previously mentioned when asked who she was able to communicate with at the moment. <nl><nl>There is no doubt that one of the main disadvantages Natasha focuses on is the idea that her personality is hindered by the lockdown: \"there is a lot of downsides...one of the things I love the most like going out, seeing my friends\", she draws attention to this significant piece missing in her life and emphasises how much she enjoys going out and seeing my friends by using the word \"love\". Due to the restrictions there may be an imbalance of work and leisure, Natasha may feel as though she is trapped in unhappiness during this global pandemic. <nl>1.2 \"...I\u2019ve not met anyone new on my course which is a bit upsetting\": the lack of engagement due to face-to-face teaching being moved online. <nl>When Natasha was asked: \"How they get along with engaging with other students\" - the response steered in a direction where she expressed a disappointment in the lack of opportunity to meet new course mates. She stated this a couple of times whilst answering this question: \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\", which may indicate that she has been deeply affected by the fact that the opportunity to engage with other students has been stripped away.<nl>University can be advertised amongst students as being a place where there is a chance to meet many different people - however, the outlook has changed significantly as those opportunities have been limited due to the restrictions; \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\" - Natasha emphasises that university no longer serves the purpose of networking and meeting new people because of social distancing.<nl><nl>2.0 \"...detached mentally from my studies\": recognising the lack of motivation.<nl>Main theme in this segment is how Natasha highlights the depletion of her mental well-being towards her studies and daily life. The lack of face-to-face teaching seems to be the reason for this, as further down the interview she mentions - \"I don\u2019t feel like a uni student (.) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m mentally there so my motivation has decreased signi-significantly\" which further supports the idea that the restrictions are detrimental to university students - due to the vast amount of lectures being moved online. This mentality and decrease of motivation may indicate a severe impact towards Natasha\u2019s mental health and well-being during this period of time. However, this could also be catastrophic for her university grades, as the lack of motivation may hinder the quality of her work and may lead her to underachieve. <nl><nl>2.1 \"...my mind is always in autopilot\": there is a lack of conscious control. <nl>Natasha goes on to use this phrase to describe her consciousness during the days in lockdown. This may emphasise the idea that her time spent in lockdown is constant and uneventful leading her to lose conscious awareness of what she is doing. The use of the word \"autopilot\" underlines the fact that she is aware that she is mentally detached from her life due to the sudden societal changes from the virus. On the other hand, it can be implied that she is comparing herself to that of a machine - where she is constantly stuck in a pattern doing the same thing daily.<nl>She goes on to mention that her \"days kinda merge into one\"- and further explains that she finds it easy to \"lose track\" of what she is doing and what she \"should be doing\",  which may lead to imply that lockdown has had both mental and physical obstacles, that Natasha has encountered and finds it difficult to plan her days and keep to a schedule. The use of the strong verb \"merge\" accentuates the difficulty Natasha is having to distinguish the days as they go by, possibly creating a blurred sense of reality whilst living with the restrictions.<nl><nl>2.2 \"spend the whole day in bed and its really taking a toll on me mentally\": is showing traits of a mental health disorder due to the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>When Natasha was asked how her daily life had changed, she proceeded to emphasise that the gym after the first lockdown, had allowed her to make progress \"mentally and physically\". However, the gyms were forced to close again following the second national lockdown. This proved to be a significant impact for Natasha \u2013 as further down in the answer she stated that she would \"spend the whole day in bed\". This may suggest that she may have been experiencing a mental health related disorder which could have been onset due to the second lockdown. This may portray the risk that the restrictions have towards the well-being of students. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, Natasha has had a wide range of negative changes and experiences whilst being a university student during the global pandemic\u2013 most aspects do relate to the new introduction of social distancing: which has proven to be a big change for her as she thrives of socialising and meeting new people. Natasha who has moved out from their hometown and is now situated in the city where she attends university is likely to feel lonely due to not being around friends or family. The decline in mental health has been evident \u2013 towards both her studies and daily life in general. Natasha finds it hard to live in the present and feels mentally absent on some days. This may indicate that being a student during the global pandemic is detrimental for individuals such as Natasha; leading to unhappiness, loneliness, disappointment, decline in mental health and being unmotivated.

These might be the activities that they enjoyed before the event occurred. <nl><nl>One of the biological changes observed is that the hippocampus is significantly smaller in individuals who develop PTSD. This region of the brain plays a role in memories related to emotion, therefore a smaller hippocampus represents a higher risk for developing PTSD after a traumatic event (Gilbertson 2002). Another biological change that is observed is the failure of the brain centres (e.g ventromedial frontal cortex) which dampens the activation of the brain's fear coordinating centre, the amygdala (Koenigs &amp; Grafman 2009). Therefore, the individual is unable to control the activation of fear after trauma."]}

The blonde haired girl is wearing a black striped, erm, top with jeans and the other girl\u2019s wearing a denim jacket. So, it doesn\u2019t seem too formal. Erm. Ee-yeah. The second image, erm, they look like students, perhaps, maybe, in a library. Erm, 'cause the laptop\u2019s placed in front of them so they look like they might be studying.

Erm, the third image looks, erm, like there\u2019s two people. They look like they\u2019re perhaps meeting some friends and it\u2019s just them two that the picture is of.  <cough>  It\u2019s a girl and a boy this time and, erm, it looks like they\u2019re perhaps in a meeting with some friends. Erm, the, the boy\u2019s holding a book, erm, so it kind of looks like it\u2019s somewhat of a formal meeting with friends, perhaps, or, maybe, work colleagues. Erm, they do seem like they\u2019re dressed fairly formal, erm, it looks quite, erm, you know, it looks quite formal. Erm, yeah, so they look like they\u2019re talking to someone else that\u2019s not in the picture as their eyes are kind of, erm, set towards, the corner of the screen. Erm, so they look like they\u2019re engaging in conversation with someone else. So, that\u2019s why, you know, erm, I assume that there\u2019s more people in the picture, it\u2019s just the picture of them two.

It is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued left than when cued right. Data from 38 participants was used. Within-subjects design. Independent variable had two levels: cue left, cue right. Dependant variable was the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V). EEG electrodes were attached to relevant areas using the 1020 system. The results showed that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions. The results are consistent with the hypothesis and previous research.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>The alpha inhibition hypothesis refers to the concept that high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha wave in the relaxation state has higher power spectrum than in the attention state. Yaomanee, K., Pan-ngum, S., &amp; Ayuthaya, P. I. N. (2012). Concluding that alpha activity can be modulated by attention, thus meaning that alpha activity is reduced when we pay attention to stimuli.<nl>This experiment is a partial replication of Sauseng et al., (2005). Overall, 22 participants used, and they were given a cued visual attention task. Cued with a fixation cross for 34ms, then an arrow cue would indicate which hemifield a target would appear in. There was a 50% chance of being cued left or right, 75% of the trials were valid and 25% of trials were invalid. Results indicated that parietal regions showed stronger alpha lower band frequency suppression contralateral to the attended hemifield. Similar results for upper frequencies. Therefore, the alpha inhibition hypothesis is supported by these findings as there is stronger alpha activity in the task irrelevant brain areas. <nl>To further support these findings, Mazahari et al., (2014) used 57 adolescent participants: 23 normally developing, 17 who have combined subtype ADHD (inattention and hyperactivity) and 17 who have predominantly inattentive ADHD. Used a cued flanker task. Response preparation cue predicted 84% accuracy, or a null cue was shown which had no information about correct response. Overall participants showed alpha suppression following response preparation cues, greater for normally developing participants and least for inattentive ADHD subtypes. The indicative alpha suppression supports the idea that alpha activity can be modulated by attention \u2013 thus being reduced when participants attended to the stimuli.<nl>Following on previous studies, it is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued to expect a stimulus on the left than when cued to expect a stimulus on the right, when recording from the left parietal lobe (P3).  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>To begin with, 39 undergraduate participants were obtained by volunteer sample, however, one participant was removed as they were only available for one of the two conditions: 38 participants overall. <nl>Design <nl>Within subject\u2019s design, with an independent variable of cue direction with two levels: either left or right. The dependent variable is the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V).<nl><nl>Materials <nl>A Biopac MP36 was used to record alpha range activity and receive event markers for cue left and cue right conditions. EEG electrodes which were attached to the head. AC Cream and Everi cream was used, in preparation prior to the attachment of electrodes. The software PsychoPy was used to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. Stimuli were used to present to the visual fields such as: arrow cues left (&lt;) and right (&gt;), large bar (Figure A) and small bar (Figure B) stimuli. <nl><figure><nl> <nl>Procedure <nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz. Digital channels were set up to receive the event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker. A calculation channel was also set up to record the activity in the alpha frequency range of (8 - 13 Hz). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. <nl>Before preparing the participants, they gave informed consent and were briefed on their right to withdraw from the experiment. To prepare the participants for electrode placement, Everi cream was used to abrase the areas P3, Fz and forehead, selected using the 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Techologies, 2012). The AC cream was then applied on the electrodes: an active electrode was attached to P3. Reference electrodes are attached at Fz. Earth electrodes were attached to the forehead, near the hairline. The impedance levels were checked to be below 10Kohms.  <nl>Participants were given instructions and a practice trial first and were cued with an arrow for 35ms to let participants know which side to expect a stimulus, with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) set to 600ms-800ms in the practice trial. Different event markers were sent at stimulus onset for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli consisted of either large or small white bars shown either left or right on the screen on a black background for 50ms. The participants respond with either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. They underwent 12 practice trials including feedback about their response, before undergoing 4 blocks of 20 trials. After the practice trail was complete, the participants were given feedback on their performance.<nl>The participants were shortly warned that the real experiment was about to start. The random ISI was set to 200ms-1200ms<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>To covert the raw 9-13 Hz Alpha EEG to averaged data. Event markers from PsychoPy were sent to identify when stimuli were presented. Then looked at the period 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown. The data was rectified, which turns the negative values into positive, in order to show alpha activity regardless of it being excitatory or inhibitory. Averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of the outlying or extreme values. The rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were then suitable for statistical analysis. <nl>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics<nl>Firstly, to determine whether the data is parametric, a Shapiro-Wilk test was used and p&lt;.005. The p value is less than .05, therefore, a non-parametric equivalent had to be used: <nl>Wilcoxon signed ranks test. <nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions and a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed this difference was significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were consistent with the predicted hypothesis, as the median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left, than cue right and this supports the idea that alpha activity at P3 is different depending on which side participants are cued to expect a stimulus. <nl>The results also support previous research and the alpha inhibition hypothesis, as high alpha shows the inhibition of task irrelevant areas due to more activity in the left hemisphere (Klimesch et al., 2007), on the ipsilateral side of where the cue was presented. <nl>Although the results are consistent with the hypothesis, confounding variables may have altered the data to an extent. The participants moving around, may have altered the validity as gross motor movements may contaminate the EEG recordings, (Bell, M. A., &amp; Cuevas, K., 2012).<nl>Overall, there may be some areas for improvement to prevent confounding variables from affecting the data. To prevent motor movements, the participants should be given strict instructions to follow due to the sensitivity of the EEG. The researchers should monitor the participants to check if those instructions are being followed. However, despite these issues, the results can be granted as valid as the correct procedures were taken during the experiment, such as ensuring the impedance levels were below 10Kohms and in addition the results were expected due to previous research.", "Erm, I\u2019d probably say a Sunday roast, erm, just because it\u2019s like, it feels most like home, erm, and yeah, literally, on a Sunday, it is the best thing to look forward to in like after work or like, erm, from like drinking on a Saturday.

This might include an increase in negative emotions and the inability to experience positive ones. For instance, if a woman was sexually abused, she might experience anxiety or fear even after her abuse. A second cognitive change might be a severe lack of interest in activities. The women might have enjoyed spending time with her friends prior to her abuse but after the abuse she might resist and avoid any involvement in activities that were once pleasurable to her. She may also blame herself for getting sexually abused. Her choice of wearing a scandalous outfit might justify why someone abused her and this would be another cognitive change.<nl><nl>There are also biological changes associated with PTSD. The amygdala is responsible for the perception of emotions and the ventromedial frontal cortex is responsible for regulating responses to emotions. However, the frontal region with those who have PTSD does not function effectively and it does not dampen down the amygdala to the same degree as it does with people without the disorder. Another biological change may be a decrease in the size of the hippocampus, and this might explain why people with PTSD have difficulties consolidating their memories.<nl><nl><nl>Question 2: Outline the proposed role of operant conditioning in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).  How would a behavioural therapist treat OCD? (Both parts of this question are equally weighted). <nl><nl>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is made up of two components, obsessions and compulsions. The compulsion refers to the repetitive behaviour, for example, suffers may regularly wash their hands to reduce anxiety. The anxiety is caused by obsessive, irrational thoughts for example, the constant fear of germs and bacteria. According to the second stage of Mowrer\u2019s (1947) two stage theory, the removal of an aversive stimulus will negatively reinforce behaviour. In other words, the removal of anxiety is caused by the compulsive acts of washing hands \u2013 negative reinforcement and the relief from the anxiety might be rewarding to a sufferer \u2013 positive reinforcement. Thus, the behaviour will perpetuate because it is both negatively and positively reinforced.<nl><nl>Behavioural therapists treat OCD using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT involves the therapist and sufferer to actively break down and challenge irrational thoughts and behaviours through exposure and response prevention (ERP). This involves the gradual exposure to the feared object, this might be a fear of dirt and individuals are counter conditioned to learn new ways to control their compulsive behaviours around the fear. Once the fear is mastered, they will adopt these changes into their daily routine and try overcome their disorder.<nl><nl>Section B<nl>Critically evaluate the concept of dependence as an explanation for substance use.<nl>Dependence is an explanation for substance use and it refers to the need for drugs in order to function and in absence of the drugs, individuals may display withdrawal symptoms. There are two types of dependence, physical and mental. Mental dependence is when the use of a substance leads to a conditioned response to an emotion or feeling. For example, someone suffering from depression might rely heavily on benzodiazepines to evoke positive emotions such as relaxation and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, this could lead to drug misuse and the dependence explanation has helped lead to practical applications to avoid this occurring. For instance, doctors will prescribe benzodiazepines only in serious cases and for less than 4 weeks to avoid dependencyaddiction. This explanation has led to a greater understanding about drugs and positive social changes.<nl><nl>The dependence explanation is limited however, because substance use could also be a result of genetic predispositions. Kendler &amp; Prescott (1998) support this notion through their research on 1,934 twins, ranging in age from 22 to 62. They were given interviews about their drug addictions to cocaine and marijuana. Kendler reported that whilst examining pairs, it was evident that the concordance rates for both twins using drugs was higher in monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ) twins. The concordance rate for cocaine use in MZ twins was 54% and in DZ twins it was 42%. Thus, this gives weight to the influence of genetics on substance use. While it is important to understand the role of heredity on substance use, environmental factors are also as important. These factors may include stress, trauma, or community pressure. Exposure to trauma has been linked closely to substance use. Witnessing death or experiencing assault would be a traumatic experience and these people are more likely to take drugs. This may be because trauma symptoms may become more manageable after self-medicating. Turning to drugs may be the easier escape for some individuals when dealing with environmental difficulties. Thus, substance use may be a result of genetic and environmental factors interacting so therefore, a diathesis stress model should be proposed.<nl><nl>Behaviourists stress the important role operant conditioning has on behaviour. Operant conditioning as proposed by Skinner (1938) can be applied to substance use. For instance, people suffering from trauma may use drugs as a coping mechanism to alleviate their trauma related symptoms (this might include shocks and mood swings). Skinner referred to negative reinforcement as the continual of behaviour to remove any aversive outcomes. Similarly, individuals might repeat the act of taking drugs because it temporarily removes their symptoms. Another concept of operant conditioning is positive reinforcement. This refers to the continual of behaviour to gain a reward. Drugs are involved in the activation of dopamine pathways.

Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001).", "Hi, <nl>my number is <phone_number><new>Hi <addr11_FN>, <nl>I am <part_FN_SN> from your tutorial group, this is my email. <nl><nl>Kind regards, <nl><part_FN><new>Hi Dr <addr3_SN>, <nl>I am <part_FN_SN> (<student_number>), first year <course> student and I wanted to contact you regarding my exam result.

The dependent variable was the proportion of correctly identified responses (PCR) after corrected false recognition presented in decimal factors (a number between 0-1).<nl> <nl>Materials  <nl>The materials that were used were four lists of 30 words from the Toronto Word Pool (Friendly, Franklin, Hoffman, &amp; Rubin, 1982) and a metronome to measure the response time in seconds. <nl> <nl>Procedure  <nl>Firstly, the researchers obtained an informed consent from all the participants. After, the participants were shown a list of 30 words before they were given a word recognition task where the 30 previously seen targets were presented with 30 previously unseen words. Words were moderately concrete, low imageability words. Four lists of 30 words were used, participants were asked to complete a mental arithmetic task between study and recognition stages. After, the participants had completed two consecutive word recognition tasks.

And then sometimes, I might have toast with butter on it, erm, if I'm hungry, if I'm eating a bit later. And then lunchtime, lunchtime varies a lot. It depends what I\u2019ve had in the morning. So, if I\u2019d had toast in the morning, then I wouldn\u2019t want bread again at lunch.  <mobile_phone_alert>  Is that mine or yours? Sorry. And then, if I have cereal, then I might have bread at lunch so, might be a sandwich, maybe some toast. Erm, if not, some, I quite like salad with like couscous in it and maybe chicken if I\u2019ve got some like defrosted or something. And then for dinner, oh I don\u2019t know, dinner, just a hot dinner. Erm, I think I'm having pasta bake tonight and some garlic bread.  <unintelligible>  carbs, actually, when I say it all in one  <laugh> . I try and have some fruit in the day as well.<new>Erm, I like, like my evening meal, like my tea the best, erm, just because when I'm at home that\u2019s when all my family sit round together. So, we\u2019re all, we\u2019ve always been really strict on dinner time that everyone puts their phones away, everyone sits round the table together, like someone cooks, someone lays the table, someone makes drinks. That\u2019s when we all see each other and sit round and have a chat and catch up on everything. Erm, so, obviously, we\u2019re all busy in the day at the minute.<new>Erm, don\u2019t know, really. Erm, I don\u2019t know  <laugh> , I quite like, erm,  <laugh> , sorry, erm, I\u2019ll just say like home cooked foods, like stuff like if I'm at home and my mum cooks, I quite like that. Like quite, I suppose traditional like English food like toad in the hole or a roast dinner, like those kind of foods.<new>Erm, well, a roast dinner will be about once a week and so, maybe,  <unintelligible>  about, well, I suppose if it\u2019s anything my mum\u2019s cooked then it\u2019ll be most days.

The two independent variables (IV) are the task conditions (dual and single) and the other is age which has three levels (young, young-old and old-old). The dependent variable (DV) is the proportion of correctly recognised words corrected for false recognition.<nl>Material: <nl>The materials that were used were 4 lists of 30 words from the Toronto word pool (Friendly, Franklin, Hoffman, &amp; Rubin, 1982, see http:euclid.psych.yorku.cashinyTWP), a metronome and a Latin square.<nl>Procedure:<nl>Initially, participants were given 30 words following a word recognition task. Within this task they were presented with the 30 previously seen and 30 previously unseen targets. The words were moderately concrete and low imageability. Participants were assigned a mental arithmetic task to complete between study and recognition stages. They completed two consecutive word recognition tasks: one on its own and one concurrently with a finger tapping task where a metronome was used to track time per second (1Hz).

{"id": "929f531c-6d23-4948-87f7-43c8c61ad8eb", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Aims and Research Questions<nl>The lockdown amidst COVID-19 has made significant disruptions in academic activities. In this lockdown period, it was reported that learners were mostly suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety (42.0%) (Kapasia, N., Paul, P., Roy, A., Saha, J., Zaveri, A., Mallick, R., ... &amp; Chouhan, P. 2020). The negative impact on student mental and physical well-being due to lockdown restrictions, may be seen as detrimental for their academia and overall performance. Other research has been carried out on the wider population, not students specifically, however the COVID-19 lockdown can be seen to affect others negatively, in terms of mental health. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderatesevere insomnia (Gualano, M. R., Lo Moro, G., Voglino, G., Bert, F., &amp; Siliquini, R. 2020). However, research on the wider student experience during COVID-19 in the UK lacks exposure, so the given indication to the gap, conducting this research could be beneficial to raise greater awareness to the subject.<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as the chosen method<nl>IPA is concerned with lived experience. Experience covers quite a lot of territory (Cooper, H. E., Camic, P. M., Long, D. L., Panter, A. T., Rindskopf, D. E., &amp; Sher, K. J. 2012). Furthermore, IPA focuses on the detailed examination of particulars, first providing an in-depth account of each case before moving to look for patterning\u2019s of convergence and divergence across cases (Eatough, V., &amp; Smith, J. A. 2008).  This method allows the researcher to analyse and understand an individual\u2019s experience towards a certain event \u2013 which in this case would be the global pandemic and how it has affected students: it allows us to explore different aspects that may have been impacted and gives us the chance to begin to comprehend those experiences. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>1. \"Feels like a waste of a university experience\"; a student who has been affected by the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>Missing out on experiences and opportunities as a university student, is a main theme in this account - which includes spending time with friends, enjoying the nightlife, parties and academic events (e.g. lectures and seminars). Natasha draws up on the fact that the university experience she is currently having is very different to what she had prior to the COVID-19 restrictions in her first year. Although, she highlights that she had been able to enjoy some of the perks of being a student in her first year of study, she emphasises the lack of it now and realises that she had taken for granted some of the opportunities she had in first year, as she states - \"I definitely should have taken those erm (.) opportunities and just spend it with the people I like being around\". This may highlight the idea that Natasha feels regret because certain experiences are not as readily available as they were before.<nl>1.1 \"I\u2019m not seeing my friends as often as I would do... I\u2019m not going out\": the negatives highlighted due to the lockdown. <nl>Natasha was asked to compare her first year to her current year of university, and the main focus had been that there is a lack of opportunity to go out with friends - to restaurants, clubs and parties: all of which have been impacted significantly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. Further down in the interview she once again emphasises the fact that she yearns for a greater chance to go out to social events: \"I really do miss going out with them and seeing them and spending time with them\". It may suggest that Natasha, who is already limited by the distance from university to her hometown and who may have relied on interaction from social events at university, has been severely impacted and may go on to feel \"lonely\" within these circumstances, as she had previously mentioned when asked who she was able to communicate with at the moment. <nl><nl>There is no doubt that one of the main disadvantages Natasha focuses on is the idea that her personality is hindered by the lockdown: \"there is a lot of downsides...one of the things I love the most like going out, seeing my friends\", she draws attention to this significant piece missing in her life and emphasises how much she enjoys going out and seeing my friends by using the word \"love\". Due to the restrictions there may be an imbalance of work and leisure, Natasha may feel as though she is trapped in unhappiness during this global pandemic. <nl>1.2 \"...I\u2019ve not met anyone new on my course which is a bit upsetting\": the lack of engagement due to face-to-face teaching being moved online. <nl>When Natasha was asked: \"How they get along with engaging with other students\" - the response steered in a direction where she expressed a disappointment in the lack of opportunity to meet new course mates. She stated this a couple of times whilst answering this question: \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\", which may indicate that she has been deeply affected by the fact that the opportunity to engage with other students has been stripped away.<nl>University can be advertised amongst students as being a place where there is a chance to meet many different people - however, the outlook has changed significantly as those opportunities have been limited due to the restrictions; \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\" - Natasha emphasises that university no longer serves the purpose of networking and meeting new people because of social distancing.<nl><nl>2.0 \"...detached mentally from my studies\": recognising the lack of motivation.<nl>Main theme in this segment is how Natasha highlights the depletion of her mental well-being towards her studies and daily life. The lack of face-to-face teaching seems to be the reason for this, as further down the interview she mentions - \"I don\u2019t feel like a uni student (.) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m mentally there so my motivation has decreased signi-significantly\" which further supports the idea that the restrictions are detrimental to university students - due to the vast amount of lectures being moved online. This mentality and decrease of motivation may indicate a severe impact towards Natasha\u2019s mental health and well-being during this period of time. However, this could also be catastrophic for her university grades, as the lack of motivation may hinder the quality of her work and may lead her to underachieve. <nl><nl>2.1 \"...my mind is always in autopilot\": there is a lack of conscious control. <nl>Natasha goes on to use this phrase to describe her consciousness during the days in lockdown. This may emphasise the idea that her time spent in lockdown is constant and uneventful leading her to lose conscious awareness of what she is doing. The use of the word \"autopilot\" underlines the fact that she is aware that she is mentally detached from her life due to the sudden societal changes from the virus. On the other hand, it can be implied that she is comparing herself to that of a machine - where she is constantly stuck in a pattern doing the same thing daily.<nl>She goes on to mention that her \"days kinda merge into one\"- and further explains that she finds it easy to \"lose track\" of what she is doing and what she \"should be doing\",  which may lead to imply that lockdown has had both mental and physical obstacles, that Natasha has encountered and finds it difficult to plan her days and keep to a schedule. The use of the strong verb \"merge\" accentuates the difficulty Natasha is having to distinguish the days as they go by, possibly creating a blurred sense of reality whilst living with the restrictions.<nl><nl>2.2 \"spend the whole day in bed and its really taking a toll on me mentally\": is showing traits of a mental health disorder due to the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>When Natasha was asked how her daily life had changed, she proceeded to emphasise that the gym after the first lockdown, had allowed her to make progress \"mentally and physically\". However, the gyms were forced to close again following the second national lockdown. This proved to be a significant impact for Natasha \u2013 as further down in the answer she stated that she would \"spend the whole day in bed\". This may suggest that she may have been experiencing a mental health related disorder which could have been onset due to the second lockdown. This may portray the risk that the restrictions have towards the well-being of students. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, Natasha has had a wide range of negative changes and experiences whilst being a university student during the global pandemic\u2013 most aspects do relate to the new introduction of social distancing: which has proven to be a big change for her as she thrives of socialising and meeting new people. Natasha who has moved out from their hometown and is now situated in the city where she attends university is likely to feel lonely due to not being around friends or family. The decline in mental health has been evident \u2013 towards both her studies and daily life in general. Natasha finds it hard to live in the present and feels mentally absent on some days. This may indicate that being a student during the global pandemic is detrimental for individuals such as Natasha; leading to unhappiness, loneliness, disappointment, decline in mental health and being unmotivated.

One is standing up and leaning over a little bit. She is wearing a black and white stripey t-shirt and some jeans, and then sat down next to her is another girl in a leather jacket \u2013 not a leather jacket, a denim jacket. Erm, she, the girl sitting down, is laughing. And the woman standing up is smiling a little bit, but she\u2019s not looking directly at her. Erm, maybe they\u2019re looking at something together, but that\u2019s not in the picture. The picture is just the girls. The background is just plain white. Erm, there might be some shapes underneath it, I can\u2019t really see. But for the most part it\u2019s either white or blocked out, so the focus of the picture is the girls. Erm, they look like maybe they\u2019re friends or maybe they\u2019re in a study group together, like they could be students. They look about student age. I\u2019d say like early twenties kind of age. And yeah, that\u2019s the first image. The second picture has got two boys in it, and the fo- the main, at the front of the picture is a laptop, is an Apple MacBook. Erm, and the background is, I think they\u2019re in like a study booth, maybe. Erm, there\u2019s a table at the front, and then the back is like black with green spots on it, different sizes, dots. And then one of the boys is wearing a t-shirt with flowers on it and pink writing, and he\u2019s got an earring in. And the other boy is wearing like a, I think it\u2019s like plaid or flannel, or whatever, a shirt over a white t-shirt. And he is looking at the laptop, and the other boy is looking at him. Again, I think students, in probably a study session. I think they might be in a study group together. They both ar- they seem happy to be there,  <laugh>  I don\u2019t know, kind of not outwardly smiling but a bit of a smile. Erm, seems like they get on, but I don\u2019t know if I would say, they don\u2019t really look like best friends I would say. So maybe they\u2019ve met in a study group, or maybe they\u2019re just acquaintances, I don\u2019t know. And then the third picture is, I guess again might be a study situation, because there\u2019s a boy in it holding a book that looks, it\u2019s quite a thick book, so maybe a textbook. Erm, they, there\u2019s a table at the front, like a glass table, and they\u2019re both sat, there are two people in it, both sat on a bench, I think? Erm, sorry, this one\u2019s a boy and a girl. The boy is holding a textbook and he\u2019s got a coat on, and some, I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s, I don\u2019t know. The girl has got her leather jacket on and some boots, and the background is, erm, is black with white dots making up the circle, and then a bigger circle, bigger circle, etc., etc. Erm, and maybe like I said also in a study session, erm, kind of setting, like students. They\u2019re both looking at someone else who\u2019s not in the picture, although there is a hand, so I guess that\u2019s the person\u2019s hand. And they\u2019re both looking quite at them, not each other. So I guess that person\u2019s speaking and they\u2019re both listening. Again they\u2019re both smiling, so obviously comfortable in the situation. Erm, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know about their relationship. That\u2019s not really clear in the picture, whether they\u2019re friends or just been again put together as part of maybe a project or something. And yeah, is that enough?"]}

Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent (CI) than the colour congruent (CC) condition. (M= 966.8, SD= 405.1). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( T= 403, n= 59, p= &lt; .001). Data shows that participants took longer to correctly identify the font colours when they were incongruent with the colour of the words written. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>The results that were found were consistent with previous research of Stroop (1935) and supported the hypothesis as participants did have a slower reaction time when identifying incongruent font colours and had a faster reaction time for the congruent condition. The reaction time was faster for the congruent condition because Cattell (1886) argued that wording reading is automatic therefore it\u2019s quicker for individuals to read the word represented to them in that condition. However, different research finding has been reported from a similar stroop task called emotional stroop (Williams et al. 1996). It was found that the emotional Stroop involves only emotional and neutral words and that color does not affect reaction time because it does not conflict with word meaning. The classic stroop test shows that the reaction time is slower because there is a conflict between an incongruent color and the word. Furthermore,  Salthouse and Meinz (1995) argue that even though age differences specific to stroop interference were minimal, other research may show the relationship between age and Stroop interference was still significant (West &amp; Baylis, 1998). <nl><nl>Finally, some of the methodological issues regarding the experiment were that volunteer sampling was used, only university students participated. Findings cannot be generalised to those who did not volunteer and the finding may not be representative of the whole population. An improvement could be made by selecting people of all ages not just university students. Another issue was that the experiment was not completed in a controlled environment, this means they could have had help from others. Another improvement could be that all the participants complete the test in a psychology lab. Also there may have been extraneous variables which may have affected the results, e.g. some participants may have completed at 9am, they would most likely been tired and have had a slower reaction time. This can be improved by making sure all students complete the test at the same time."]}

This study will focus on the politeness strategies used by each gender when critiquing the contestants. To achieve this, it will investigate the number of lines of speech, the use of positive as opposed to negative adjectives and the use of hedges or intensifiers. A hedge is a linguistic device used to mitigate a statement by lowering epistemic modality and directness with the goal of reducing the threat to face (Salager-Meyer, 1994; Brown and Levinson, 1978.) On the other hand, an intensifier is an adverb or adverbial phrase used to give emphasis (Bolinger, 1972). <nl>The data used in this study is from The Great British Bake Off (which will from here onwards be referred to as GBBO) and MasterChef: The Professionals, which will simply be referred to as MasterChef. These two programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions, but MasterChef features professional chefs and GBBO amateur bakers. There is also a difference in formality as GBBO is more informal and light-hearted which is shown by its two presenters both being comedians. On the other hand, MasterChef is more formal in tone and takes a more serious approach. <nl>This topic has been chosen as it combines politeness theories with gender theory in order to examine how they interact with each other, applying this to a competition environment. Both of the datasets are from television shows therefore it is important to take into account that they may be edited to portray people in a certain way or to best fulfil the main purpose of the shows, which is to entertain. It will be interesting to see how this artificial environment impacts the judges as they may be inclined to be more polite than usual in order to portray themselves well on television, or less polite if their career is based on them playing a \"villain\" role.<nl><nl>Research Background <nl>There has been much debate by linguistics over the relationship between gender and language and the effect the former has on the latter. One of the seminal theorists in this subject is Robin Lakoff (1975) who suggested that there are fundamental differences in how men and women use language. Most relevant to this paper was her identified differences in the use of polite forms, with women typically using more polite forms than men. Janet Holmes (2013) also agreed that women are more likely to use polite forms, although acknowledged that there are differences depending on factors such as the context of the interaction and the specific people involved. She argued that: <nl>\"when all the necessary reservations and qualifications have been taken into account, I think the answer is \u2018yes, women are more polite than men\u2019\" (Holmes, 1995: 5). <nl>It has also been suggested that women use more polite forms as they are more powerless than men (Deuchar, 1988). One theory that supports this is the dominance theory which investigated the number of interruptions between men and women in a mixed gender conversation (Zimmerman and West, 1975). The study found that men are much more likely to interrupt than women and across the eleven conversations they recorded women interrupted only twice whereas men interrupted 46 times. This supports the idea that women are more polite than men, however the study only has a small sample size of 35 participants, all of whom were from a similar background, and is over 45 years old. <nl>Looking more closely at politeness, it can be defined as a type of communication that shows respect and gives some benefit to the other communicators (Leech, 2014). It is an act which aims to maintain the other participants\u2019 positive and negative face (Goffman, 1967). <nl>Leech\u2019s politeness principle (1983) argues that speakers must follow six maxims in order to be considered polite. The theory builds on Grice\u2019s maxims of conversation (1975) but expands these maxim\u2019s and focuses them specifically on appearing polite. These maxims of politeness are; tact, generosity, approbation, modesty and agreement. This study will focus on the maxim of approbation, which involves maximising expressions of praise and approval and lessening the expressions of dispraise. <nl>In a recent study, these maxims were applied to high school students and their interactions with teachers in order to investigate how gender influences politeness (Ningsih et al., 2020). The study used a qualitive approach and gathered data through observations and recordings. They found that both male and female students adhered to the politeness principle more strongly with female teachers than with male teachers. This could suggest that how polite a speaker is depends on the gender of the person they are speaking to more than their own gender identification. Although this study looks only at the speaker and does not take into account the gender of the addressee, this could account for some of the patterns of politeness encountered and therefore is worth taking into consideration. <nl>Looking at this previous research, it could be expected that the female judges in this study will show more behaviours associated with politeness than the male judges, which will be shown through an increase of positive adjectives and a decrease of negative adjectives. It is also expected that the female judges will more often seek to minimise the amount of dispraise given and use hedges to save the hearer\u2019s positive face, whilst using more intensifiers to emphasise praise. It is also anticipated that males will dominate the conversation more, which could be seen as impolite as they allow less room in the conversation for the female judges to speak.<nl><nl>Methodology <nl>The data used in this investigation is from the final episode of the 2020 series of GBBO and the 2020 final of MasterChef. In each episode there are three contestants remaining and so, by using the first challenge they are given in each, there are three sets of comparable data for each show. Each judgement was then transcribed using the key in appendix one. The narration in MasterChef was excluded from the transcripts as it was edited in later and therefore was not part of the conversation being analysed. This analysis only focused on the judge\u2019s communication; however, the contestants and presenter\u2019s speech were included in the transcriptions for context. <nl>These programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions and so the type of praisecriticism given is comparable. However, the difference in tone and level of formality between the programmes allows a deeper investigation into the impact of context on politeness. It will be of interest to see whether the hypothesises are realised and whether the tone and formality of each programme impacts this, and if so to what extent. These programmes were also chosen as they have mixed gender judging panels thus the impact of gender can be observed. <nl>Once the data had been collected, it was analysed using a quantitative approach. The number of lines of speech by each of the judges was counted in each extract and placed into table one. In MasterChef there were three judges, two of which were male. In order to calculate the number of lines of speech for the males, the number for each judge was added together and then divided by two. Although this removes the influence of the individual, which is a disadvantage, it allows the proportion of speech by each gender to be directly compared, which for the purposes of this investigation was deemed more important. <nl>When counting the lines of speech, each line was counted as a whole regardless of the length. However, there is one result which contains a half due to the calculation used to find the average. Speech was also counted as one line if it was transcribed across two due to interruption but the utterance carried on unbroken. <nl>The use of adjectives was also counted and placed into a table (table two) and the context of the utterance was used to determine whether an adjective was used positively as praise, or negatively to criticise. The same method was then applied to the use of hedges and intensifiers, which were then discussed in a qualitative light to determine the effect they had on the overall politeness of each statement.<nl><nl>Findings <nl>i. Amount of speech by male and female judges <nl>The following table summarises the number of lines of speech made by male and female judges in each dataset. As there were two male judges in MasterChef the average number of lines of speech made between them has been used, as mentioned in the methodology. <nl><table><nl>Looking at GBBO first, on average the male judge (Paul) utters more lines of speech than the female judge (Prue). In the judgements of contestants one and three, Paul utters eight lines of speech as opposed to Prue\u2019s six lines, an increase of 28.57%. This is befitting the hypothesis that the male judge will speak more than the female judge, however the data featuring contestant two conflicts with this. In this instance, Prue has one more line of speech than Paul which is a 22.22% difference. Overall, Paul speaks more than Prue in two of the three extracts, and in there is a greater difference between the judges when Paul is the one speaking more. Across all three extracts Paul is shown to utter 16.22% more lines of speech than Prue, conforming to the expected results. <nl>Analysing the MasterChef results, the males (Gregg and Marcus) utter more lines of speech in the judgements of contestants one and two than the female judge (Monica). In the transcript featuring contestant one there is a 40% difference in the number of utterances, and in the next there is a 22.22% difference. This is a greater increase in the amount of speech by males as opposed to females than was seen in GBBO. Yet, when the judgement of contestant three is analysed, the largest difference in speech of all the transcripts is shown with Monica speaking 66.67% more lines than the male judges. This means that overall, there is only a 3.39% difference between the male and female judges, with the female judge having uttered more lines in total. This disagrees with the hypothesis that men would talk more but the difference in utterance of lines is minimal. <nl>To conclude, the data from GBBO is in accordance with the hypothesis made that males will utter more lines of speech than females, but the data from MasterChef contradicts it. There are a few possible explanations for why this might have occurred. One explanation is the difference in tone between the two shows; In MasterChef the setting is more formal and professional whereas GBBO is a more informal setting where the judges interact with the contestants more colloquially. Therefore, GBBO mirrors normal conversations more than MasterChef and the context relates more closely to that of the studies researched for this paper. There is also a difference in the way the programmes are formatted. The judgement in GBBO is more like a conversation in the first challenge, so there are examples of turn-taking within the conversation. In contrast, on MasterChef the judges speak one at a time in longer instances and there are no conversations between them. This could influence the results as it means the participants are not dominating the conversation but rather giving a longer individual monologue. <nl>It is also of note that the extracts transcribed are only a couple of minutes long and therefore there is only a relatively small amount of data. In a longer conversation there is a possibility that the difference between male and female speech could become more defined.<nl><nl>ii. Use of adjectives <nl>When categorising the use of adjectives into positive or negative classifications, the context of the sentence was used to determine what category was most appropriate. They were then collated into the table below. <nl><table><nl>For example, \"wobbly\" was classed as a positive adjective as it was used in the utterance \"I like the wobbly lines\" (Appendix three, lines 20-22). <nl>Analysing the use of adjectives by the GBBO judges, Prue used more positive adjectives with each contestant as well as a greater range of adjectives. Looking at the use of negative adjectives, both judges used a similar number however Paul used one more. Therefore, the GBBO data aligns with the hypothesis that the female judge would use more adjectives that signal praise, and the male more negative adjectives. <nl>When comparing this to the results for the MasterChef data, Monica used an equal number of negative adjectives as Marcus, and one more than Gregg who did not use any. This contradicts the hypothesis and suggests that Monica is more willing to risk threatening the contestants face than Gregg, who only uses compliments. When judging the first contestant, Gregg used seven times as many adjectives to give praise than Monica did, and more than twice as many as Marcus. With the next contestant all three judges used the same number of positive adjectives and with the final contestant Monica used the most; using four times as many as Gregg and twice as many as Marcus. Ranking the judges based on their use of positive minus negative adjectives, Marcus and Monica both ranked the same and Gregg ranked highest meaning he is most concerned with politeness and least willing to flout the maxim of approbation. In summary, the data from MasterChef does not support the hypothesis and contrasts with the GBBO results. <nl><nl>iii. Use of hedges and intensifiers <nl>Within this table a colour-coding system has been using to differentiate between the hedges and intensifiers that have been used in relation to negative statements, and those that have been used positively. Text in green represents the words and phrases that have be used in relation to praise, and red has been used for text that relates to dispraise or criticism. <nl><table><nl>The intensifier \"very very\" was kept as one phrase within the table rather than two instances of the word \"very\" to emphasise how strongly the praise was given. <nl>The results from the analysis on hedging and intensifiers is similar to the patterns seen when investigating the use of adjectives. In the GBBO data, Prue used more positively associated hedges and intensifiers and fewer negative ones than Paul. <nl>Similarly, in the MasterChef data Gregg did not use any negative forms of these linguistic features which correlates with his use of adjectives. Although Marcus used more negative forms of the features than Monica, he also used more positive forms therefore showing they have an equal level of politeness as shown with their use of adjectives. <nl>Overall, this section again confirms that the judges in GBBO conform to the ideas of gender and politeness, whereas the judges in MasterChef do not. This could be down to the individual\u2019s character, as the social constructivist theory suggests that gender is only one part of our identity that influences communication; Personality, status, level of education and ethnicity also all serve to shape our communication (Burr, 2015). It suggests that people make each element of this construction relevant or irrelevant as is necessary. This suggests that Monica and Gregg could be choosing not to make their gender relevant to their role as judge, and each is relying on other factors to influence their use of praise instead. <nl><nl>Discussion <nl>One section that is particularly interesting is where Paul and Prue discussed the issues with Dave\u2019s custard slice in the GGBO. In the extract below, both judges use a mixture of hedges and praise to try and soften their criticism of Dave and minimise their flouting of the maxim of approbation. <nl><data_extract><nl>In cooking the adjective \"strong\" can be both positive or negative. In this extract Prue signals that she is using it positively by her use of the phrase \"I love the coffee\" before describing it as strong, thereby using it to praise Dave. The use of the intensifier \"really\" emphasises the strength of the flavour which adds to this praise. This extract also features the word \"stodgy\" three times. In the first instance, Paul used it to criticise Dave\u2019s custard which is an example of a positive face threatening act. However, Paul lessens the impact of the criticism by using the hedging phrase \"a little bit\" therefore minimising the expression of dispraise as laid out in Leech\u2019s maxim of approbation (1983). Prue then repeats this criticism however she uses the adjective \"stodgy\" twice with an emphasis on the first time. In this instance she is using the first expression of stodgy as a hedge to minimise the impact of the second expression, hereby implying it is not as bad as it could be and is only minorly stodgy. Again, this helps to minimise the impoliteness and helps to save face. \"Pretty\" is also used as a hedge in this extract, which lessens the compliment of it being \"delicious\". The use of the adverb \"still\" serves to further lessen it, so although Prue is paying a compliment, she is still acknowledging that the baking has flaws. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, the hypothesises that female judges would use more language concerned with politeness were realised to a certain extent. The patterns of communication shown by the GBBO judges did match up with what was expected, however the judges in MasterChef conformed to these expectations to a much lesser extent. This could be due to the formality of the show as opposed to the more colloquial nature of The Great British Bake Off, although it could also be due to the individual backgrounds and personalities of each judge. There is also a possibility that the gender of the contestant being judged has an impact on how the judges use politeness. Future research could investigate further by looking at a greater range of programmes and including more data for each. There is also an age difference of 35 years between the two female judges so it could be interesting to investigate deeper into how the changes in society between these years have influenced how women use language in reference to politeness.", "Erm, not sure.

For instance, if a woman was sexually abused, she might experience anxiety or fear even after her abuse. A second cognitive change might be a severe lack of interest in activities. The women might have enjoyed spending time with her friends prior to her abuse but after the abuse she might resist and avoid any involvement in activities that were once pleasurable to her.

However, the frontal region with those who have PTSD does not function effectively and it does not dampen down the amygdala to the same degree as it does with people without the disorder. Another biological change may be a decrease in the size of the hippocampus, and this might explain why people with PTSD have difficulties consolidating their memories.<nl><nl><nl>Question 2: Outline the proposed role of operant conditioning in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).  How would a behavioural therapist treat OCD? (Both parts of this question are equally weighted). <nl><nl>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is made up of two components, obsessions and compulsions. The compulsion refers to the repetitive behaviour, for example, suffers may regularly wash their hands to reduce anxiety. The anxiety is caused by obsessive, irrational thoughts for example, the constant fear of germs and bacteria. According to the second stage of Mowrer\u2019s (1947) two stage theory, the removal of an aversive stimulus will negatively reinforce behaviour. In other words, the removal of anxiety is caused by the compulsive acts of washing hands \u2013 negative reinforcement and the relief from the anxiety might be rewarding to a sufferer \u2013 positive reinforcement. Thus, the behaviour will perpetuate because it is both negatively and positively reinforced.<nl><nl>Behavioural therapists treat OCD using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT involves the therapist and sufferer to actively break down and challenge irrational thoughts and behaviours through exposure and response prevention (ERP). This involves the gradual exposure to the feared object, this might be a fear of dirt and individuals are counter conditioned to learn new ways to control their compulsive behaviours around the fear. Once the fear is mastered, they will adopt these changes into their daily routine and try overcome their disorder.<nl><nl>Section B<nl>Critically evaluate the concept of dependence as an explanation for substance use.<nl>Dependence is an explanation for substance use and it refers to the need for drugs in order to function and in absence of the drugs, individuals may display withdrawal symptoms. There are two types of dependence, physical and mental. Mental dependence is when the use of a substance leads to a conditioned response to an emotion or feeling. For example, someone suffering from depression might rely heavily on benzodiazepines to evoke positive emotions such as relaxation and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, this could lead to drug misuse and the dependence explanation has helped lead to practical applications to avoid this occurring. For instance, doctors will prescribe benzodiazepines only in serious cases and for less than 4 weeks to avoid dependencyaddiction. This explanation has led to a greater understanding about drugs and positive social changes.<nl><nl>The dependence explanation is limited however, because substance use could also be a result of genetic predispositions. Kendler &amp; Prescott (1998) support this notion through their research on 1,934 twins, ranging in age from 22 to 62. They were given interviews about their drug addictions to cocaine and marijuana. Kendler reported that whilst examining pairs, it was evident that the concordance rates for both twins using drugs was higher in monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ) twins. The concordance rate for cocaine use in MZ twins was 54% and in DZ twins it was 42%. Thus, this gives weight to the influence of genetics on substance use. While it is important to understand the role of heredity on substance use, environmental factors are also as important. These factors may include stress, trauma, or community pressure. Exposure to trauma has been linked closely to substance use. Witnessing death or experiencing assault would be a traumatic experience and these people are more likely to take drugs. This may be because trauma symptoms may become more manageable after self-medicating. Turning to drugs may be the easier escape for some individuals when dealing with environmental difficulties. Thus, substance use may be a result of genetic and environmental factors interacting so therefore, a diathesis stress model should be proposed.<nl><nl>Behaviourists stress the important role operant conditioning has on behaviour. Operant conditioning as proposed by Skinner (1938) can be applied to substance use. For instance, people suffering from trauma may use drugs as a coping mechanism to alleviate their trauma related symptoms (this might include shocks and mood swings). Skinner referred to negative reinforcement as the continual of behaviour to remove any aversive outcomes. Similarly, individuals might repeat the act of taking drugs because it temporarily removes their symptoms. Another concept of operant conditioning is positive reinforcement. This refers to the continual of behaviour to gain a reward. Drugs are involved in the activation of dopamine pathways. These pathways stimulate pleasure and reward thus might also explain why people continue to take drugs. Therefore, the dependent explanation can not alone explain substance use as a variety of factors and explanations might account for it.", "Erm, so, in the first picture, I can see two young ladies, erm, er, one in stripy black and white top with blonde hair.

Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals.

Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001)."]}

The two independent variables (IV) are the task conditions (dual and single) and the other is age which has three levels (young, young-old and old-old). The dependent variable (DV) is the proportion of correctly recognised words corrected for false recognition.<nl>Material: <nl>The materials that were used were 4 lists of 30 words from the Toronto word pool (Friendly, Franklin, Hoffman, &amp; Rubin, 1982, see http:euclid.psych.yorku.cashinyTWP), a metronome and a Latin square.<nl>Procedure:<nl>Initially, participants were given 30 words following a word recognition task. Within this task they were presented with the 30 previously seen and 30 previously unseen targets. The words were moderately concrete and low imageability. Participants were assigned a mental arithmetic task to complete between study and recognition stages. They completed two consecutive word recognition tasks: one on its own and one concurrently with a finger tapping task where a metronome was used to track time per second (1Hz). In order to counterbalance, a Latin square was used to minimize order effect. False recognition was corrected and presented as decimal fractions at the end where the numbers were between 0 and 1 indicated the proportion of correctly recognised words.

Moreover, there is no difference in the mean for correct responses for the young-old group in dual and task conditions (t(57) =0.03, p = 1.000). The post hoc tests 95% confidence interval range did overlap suggesting that the population mean would be different.

{"id": "6f97e775-6fb7-46f2-bcfb-c5be46df7d7202659", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Aims and Research Questions<nl>The lockdown amidst COVID-19 has made significant disruptions in academic activities. In this lockdown period, it was reported that learners were mostly suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety (42.0%) (Kapasia, N., Paul, P., Roy, A., Saha, J., Zaveri, A., Mallick, R., ... &amp; Chouhan, P. 2020). The negative impact on student mental and physical well-being due to lockdown restrictions, may be seen as detrimental for their academia and overall performance. Other research has been carried out on the wider population, not students specifically, however the COVID-19 lockdown can be seen to affect others negatively, in terms of mental health. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderatesevere insomnia (Gualano, M. R., Lo Moro, G., Voglino, G., Bert, F., &amp; Siliquini, R. 2020). However, research on the wider student experience during COVID-19 in the UK lacks exposure, so the given indication to the gap, conducting this research could be beneficial to raise greater awareness to the subject.<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as the chosen method<nl>IPA is concerned with lived experience. Experience covers quite a lot of territory (Cooper, H. E., Camic, P. M., Long, D. L., Panter, A. T., Rindskopf, D. E., &amp; Sher, K. J. 2012). Furthermore, IPA focuses on the detailed examination of particulars, first providing an in-depth account of each case before moving to look for patterning\u2019s of convergence and divergence across cases (Eatough, V., &amp; Smith, J. A. 2008).  This method allows the researcher to analyse and understand an individual\u2019s experience towards a certain event \u2013 which in this case would be the global pandemic and how it has affected students: it allows us to explore different aspects that may have been impacted and gives us the chance to begin to comprehend those experiences. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>1. \"Feels like a waste of a university experience\"; a student who has been affected by the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>Missing out on experiences and opportunities as a university student, is a main theme in this account - which includes spending time with friends, enjoying the nightlife, parties and academic events (e.g. lectures and seminars). Natasha draws up on the fact that the university experience she is currently having is very different to what she had prior to the COVID-19 restrictions in her first year. Although, she highlights that she had been able to enjoy some of the perks of being a student in her first year of study, she emphasises the lack of it now and realises that she had taken for granted some of the opportunities she had in first year, as she states - \"I definitely should have taken those erm (.) opportunities and just spend it with the people I like being around\". This may highlight the idea that Natasha feels regret because certain experiences are not as readily available as they were before.<nl>1.1 \"I\u2019m not seeing my friends as often as I would do... I\u2019m not going out\": the negatives highlighted due to the lockdown. <nl>Natasha was asked to compare her first year to her current year of university, and the main focus had been that there is a lack of opportunity to go out with friends - to restaurants, clubs and parties: all of which have been impacted significantly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. Further down in the interview she once again emphasises the fact that she yearns for a greater chance to go out to social events: \"I really do miss going out with them and seeing them and spending time with them\". It may suggest that Natasha, who is already limited by the distance from university to her hometown and who may have relied on interaction from social events at university, has been severely impacted and may go on to feel \"lonely\" within these circumstances, as she had previously mentioned when asked who she was able to communicate with at the moment. <nl><nl>There is no doubt that one of the main disadvantages Natasha focuses on is the idea that her personality is hindered by the lockdown: \"there is a lot of downsides...one of the things I love the most like going out, seeing my friends\", she draws attention to this significant piece missing in her life and emphasises how much she enjoys going out and seeing my friends by using the word \"love\". Due to the restrictions there may be an imbalance of work and leisure, Natasha may feel as though she is trapped in unhappiness during this global pandemic. <nl>1.2 \"...I\u2019ve not met anyone new on my course which is a bit upsetting\": the lack of engagement due to face-to-face teaching being moved online. <nl>When Natasha was asked: \"How they get along with engaging with other students\" - the response steered in a direction where she expressed a disappointment in the lack of opportunity to meet new course mates. She stated this a couple of times whilst answering this question: \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\", which may indicate that she has been deeply affected by the fact that the opportunity to engage with other students has been stripped away.<nl>University can be advertised amongst students as being a place where there is a chance to meet many different people - however, the outlook has changed significantly as those opportunities have been limited due to the restrictions; \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\" - Natasha emphasises that university no longer serves the purpose of networking and meeting new people because of social distancing.<nl><nl>2.0 \"...detached mentally from my studies\": recognising the lack of motivation.<nl>Main theme in this segment is how Natasha highlights the depletion of her mental well-being towards her studies and daily life. The lack of face-to-face teaching seems to be the reason for this, as further down the interview she mentions - \"I don\u2019t feel like a uni student (.) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m mentally there so my motivation has decreased signi-significantly\" which further supports the idea that the restrictions are detrimental to university students - due to the vast amount of lectures being moved online. This mentality and decrease of motivation may indicate a severe impact towards Natasha\u2019s mental health and well-being during this period of time. However, this could also be catastrophic for her university grades, as the lack of motivation may hinder the quality of her work and may lead her to underachieve. <nl><nl>2.1 \"...my mind is always in autopilot\": there is a lack of conscious control. <nl>Natasha goes on to use this phrase to describe her consciousness during the days in lockdown. This may emphasise the idea that her time spent in lockdown is constant and uneventful leading her to lose conscious awareness of what she is doing. The use of the word \"autopilot\" underlines the fact that she is aware that she is mentally detached from her life due to the sudden societal changes from the virus. On the other hand, it can be implied that she is comparing herself to that of a machine - where she is constantly stuck in a pattern doing the same thing daily.<nl>She goes on to mention that her \"days kinda merge into one\"- and further explains that she finds it easy to \"lose track\" of what she is doing and what she \"should be doing\",  which may lead to imply that lockdown has had both mental and physical obstacles, that Natasha has encountered and finds it difficult to plan her days and keep to a schedule. The use of the strong verb \"merge\" accentuates the difficulty Natasha is having to distinguish the days as they go by, possibly creating a blurred sense of reality whilst living with the restrictions.<nl><nl>2.2 \"spend the whole day in bed and its really taking a toll on me mentally\": is showing traits of a mental health disorder due to the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>When Natasha was asked how her daily life had changed, she proceeded to emphasise that the gym after the first lockdown, had allowed her to make progress \"mentally and physically\". However, the gyms were forced to close again following the second national lockdown. This proved to be a significant impact for Natasha \u2013 as further down in the answer she stated that she would \"spend the whole day in bed\". This may suggest that she may have been experiencing a mental health related disorder which could have been onset due to the second lockdown. This may portray the risk that the restrictions have towards the well-being of students. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, Natasha has had a wide range of negative changes and experiences whilst being a university student during the global pandemic\u2013 most aspects do relate to the new introduction of social distancing: which has proven to be a big change for her as she thrives of socialising and meeting new people. Natasha who has moved out from their hometown and is now situated in the city where she attends university is likely to feel lonely due to not being around friends or family. The decline in mental health has been evident \u2013 towards both her studies and daily life in general. Natasha finds it hard to live in the present and feels mentally absent on some days. This may indicate that being a student during the global pandemic is detrimental for individuals such as Natasha; leading to unhappiness, loneliness, disappointment, decline in mental health and being unmotivated.

Alpha wave in the relaxation state has higher power spectrum than in the attention state. Yaomanee, K., Pan-ngum, S., &amp; Ayuthaya, P. I. N. (2012). Concluding that alpha activity can be modulated by attention, thus meaning that alpha activity is reduced when we pay attention to stimuli.<nl>This experiment is a partial replication of Sauseng et al., (2005). Overall, 22 participants used, and they were given a cued visual attention task. Cued with a fixation cross for 34ms, then an arrow cue would indicate which hemifield a target would appear in. There was a 50% chance of being cued left or right, 75% of the trials were valid and 25% of trials were invalid. Results indicated that parietal regions showed stronger alpha lower band frequency suppression contralateral to the attended hemifield. Similar results for upper frequencies. Therefore, the alpha inhibition hypothesis is supported by these findings as there is stronger alpha activity in the task irrelevant brain areas. <nl>To further support these findings, Mazahari et al., (2014) used 57 adolescent participants: 23 normally developing, 17 who have combined subtype ADHD (inattention and hyperactivity) and 17 who have predominantly inattentive ADHD. Used a cued flanker task. Response preparation cue predicted 84% accuracy, or a null cue was shown which had no information about correct response. Overall participants showed alpha suppression following response preparation cues, greater for normally developing participants and least for inattentive ADHD subtypes. The indicative alpha suppression supports the idea that alpha activity can be modulated by attention \u2013 thus being reduced when participants attended to the stimuli.<nl>Following on previous studies, it is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued to expect a stimulus on the left than when cued to expect a stimulus on the right, when recording from the left parietal lobe (P3).  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>To begin with, 39 undergraduate participants were obtained by volunteer sample, however, one participant was removed as they were only available for one of the two conditions: 38 participants overall. <nl>Design <nl>Within subject\u2019s design, with an independent variable of cue direction with two levels: either left or right. The dependent variable is the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V).<nl><nl>Materials <nl>A Biopac MP36 was used to record alpha range activity and receive event markers for cue left and cue right conditions. EEG electrodes which were attached to the head. AC Cream and Everi cream was used, in preparation prior to the attachment of electrodes. The software PsychoPy was used to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. Stimuli were used to present to the visual fields such as: arrow cues left (&lt;) and right (&gt;), large bar (Figure A) and small bar (Figure B) stimuli. <nl><figure><nl> <nl>Procedure <nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz. Digital channels were set up to receive the event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker. A calculation channel was also set up to record the activity in the alpha frequency range of (8 - 13 Hz). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. <nl>Before preparing the participants, they gave informed consent and were briefed on their right to withdraw from the experiment. To prepare the participants for electrode placement, Everi cream was used to abrase the areas P3, Fz and forehead, selected using the 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Techologies, 2012). The AC cream was then applied on the electrodes: an active electrode was attached to P3. Reference electrodes are attached at Fz. Earth electrodes were attached to the forehead, near the hairline. The impedance levels were checked to be below 10Kohms.  <nl>Participants were given instructions and a practice trial first and were cued with an arrow for 35ms to let participants know which side to expect a stimulus, with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) set to 600ms-800ms in the practice trial. Different event markers were sent at stimulus onset for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli consisted of either large or small white bars shown either left or right on the screen on a black background for 50ms. The participants respond with either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. They underwent 12 practice trials including feedback about their response, before undergoing 4 blocks of 20 trials. After the practice trail was complete, the participants were given feedback on their performance.<nl>The participants were shortly warned that the real experiment was about to start. The random ISI was set to 200ms-1200ms<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>To covert the raw 9-13 Hz Alpha EEG to averaged data. Event markers from PsychoPy were sent to identify when stimuli were presented. Then looked at the period 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown. The data was rectified, which turns the negative values into positive, in order to show alpha activity regardless of it being excitatory or inhibitory. Averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of the outlying or extreme values. The rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were then suitable for statistical analysis. <nl>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics<nl>Firstly, to determine whether the data is parametric, a Shapiro-Wilk test was used and p&lt;.005. The p value is less than .05, therefore, a non-parametric equivalent had to be used: <nl>Wilcoxon signed ranks test. <nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions and a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed this difference was significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were consistent with the predicted hypothesis, as the median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left, than cue right and this supports the idea that alpha activity at P3 is different depending on which side participants are cued to expect a stimulus. <nl>The results also support previous research and the alpha inhibition hypothesis, as high alpha shows the inhibition of task irrelevant areas due to more activity in the left hemisphere (Klimesch et al., 2007), on the ipsilateral side of where the cue was presented. <nl>Although the results are consistent with the hypothesis, confounding variables may have altered the data to an extent. The participants moving around, may have altered the validity as gross motor movements may contaminate the EEG recordings, (Bell, M. A., &amp; Cuevas, K., 2012).<nl>Overall, there may be some areas for improvement to prevent confounding variables from affecting the data. To prevent motor movements, the participants should be given strict instructions to follow due to the sensitivity of the EEG. The researchers should monitor the participants to check if those instructions are being followed. However, despite these issues, the results can be granted as valid as the correct procedures were taken during the experiment, such as ensuring the impedance levels were below 10Kohms and in addition the results were expected due to previous research.", "Hi,<nl>I still have not received my order which is very frustrating.

Within this task they were presented with the 30 previously seen and 30 previously unseen targets. The words were moderately concrete and low imageability. Participants were assigned a mental arithmetic task to complete between study and recognition stages. They completed two consecutive word recognition tasks: one on its own and one concurrently with a finger tapping task where a metronome was used to track time per second (1Hz). In order to counterbalance, a Latin square was used to minimize order effect. False recognition was corrected and presented as decimal fractions at the end where the numbers were between 0 and 1 indicated the proportion of correctly recognised words.

Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001)."]}

This region of the brain plays a role in memories related to emotion, therefore a smaller hippocampus represents a higher risk for developing PTSD after a traumatic event (Gilbertson 2002). Another biological change that is observed is the failure of the brain centres (e.g ventromedial frontal cortex) which dampens the activation of the brain's fear coordinating centre, the amygdala (Koenigs &amp; Grafman 2009).

Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent (CI) than the colour congruent (CC) condition. (M= 966.8, SD= 405.1). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( T= 403, n= 59, p= &lt; .001). Data shows that participants took longer to correctly identify the font colours when they were incongruent with the colour of the words written. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>The results that were found were consistent with previous research of Stroop (1935) and supported the hypothesis as participants did have a slower reaction time when identifying incongruent font colours and had a faster reaction time for the congruent condition. The reaction time was faster for the congruent condition because Cattell (1886) argued that wording reading is automatic therefore it\u2019s quicker for individuals to read the word represented to them in that condition. However, different research finding has been reported from a similar stroop task called emotional stroop (Williams et al. 1996). It was found that the emotional Stroop involves only emotional and neutral words and that color does not affect reaction time because it does not conflict with word meaning. The classic stroop test shows that the reaction time is slower because there is a conflict between an incongruent color and the word. Furthermore,  Salthouse and Meinz (1995) argue that even though age differences specific to stroop interference were minimal, other research may show the relationship between age and Stroop interference was still significant (West &amp; Baylis, 1998). <nl><nl>Finally, some of the methodological issues regarding the experiment were that volunteer sampling was used, only university students participated. Findings cannot be generalised to those who did not volunteer and the finding may not be representative of the whole population. An improvement could be made by selecting people of all ages not just university students. Another issue was that the experiment was not completed in a controlled environment, this means they could have had help from others. Another improvement could be that all the participants complete the test in a psychology lab. Also there may have been extraneous variables which may have affected the results, e.g. some participants may have completed at 9am, they would most likely been tired and have had a slower reaction time. This can be improved by making sure all students complete the test at the same time."]}

It is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued left than when cued right. Data from 38 participants was used. Within-subjects design. Independent variable had two levels: cue left, cue right. Dependant variable was the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V). EEG electrodes were attached to relevant areas using the 1020 system. The results showed that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions. The results are consistent with the hypothesis and previous research.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>The alpha inhibition hypothesis refers to the concept that high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha wave in the relaxation state has higher power spectrum than in the attention state. Yaomanee, K., Pan-ngum, S., &amp; Ayuthaya, P. I. N. (2012). Concluding that alpha activity can be modulated by attention, thus meaning that alpha activity is reduced when we pay attention to stimuli.<nl>This experiment is a partial replication of Sauseng et al., (2005). Overall, 22 participants used, and they were given a cued visual attention task. Cued with a fixation cross for 34ms, then an arrow cue would indicate which hemifield a target would appear in. There was a 50% chance of being cued left or right, 75% of the trials were valid and 25% of trials were invalid. Results indicated that parietal regions showed stronger alpha lower band frequency suppression contralateral to the attended hemifield. Similar results for upper frequencies. Therefore, the alpha inhibition hypothesis is supported by these findings as there is stronger alpha activity in the task irrelevant brain areas. <nl>To further support these findings, Mazahari et al., (2014) used 57 adolescent participants: 23 normally developing, 17 who have combined subtype ADHD (inattention and hyperactivity) and 17 who have predominantly inattentive ADHD. Used a cued flanker task. Response preparation cue predicted 84% accuracy, or a null cue was shown which had no information about correct response. Overall participants showed alpha suppression following response preparation cues, greater for normally developing participants and least for inattentive ADHD subtypes. The indicative alpha suppression supports the idea that alpha activity can be modulated by attention \u2013 thus being reduced when participants attended to the stimuli.<nl>Following on previous studies, it is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued to expect a stimulus on the left than when cued to expect a stimulus on the right, when recording from the left parietal lobe (P3).  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>To begin with, 39 undergraduate participants were obtained by volunteer sample, however, one participant was removed as they were only available for one of the two conditions: 38 participants overall. <nl>Design <nl>Within subject\u2019s design, with an independent variable of cue direction with two levels: either left or right. The dependent variable is the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V).<nl><nl>Materials <nl>A Biopac MP36 was used to record alpha range activity and receive event markers for cue left and cue right conditions. EEG electrodes which were attached to the head. AC Cream and Everi cream was used, in preparation prior to the attachment of electrodes. The software PsychoPy was used to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. Stimuli were used to present to the visual fields such as: arrow cues left (&lt;) and right (&gt;), large bar (Figure A) and small bar (Figure B) stimuli. <nl><figure><nl> <nl>Procedure <nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz. Digital channels were set up to receive the event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker. A calculation channel was also set up to record the activity in the alpha frequency range of (8 - 13 Hz). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. <nl>Before preparing the participants, they gave informed consent and were briefed on their right to withdraw from the experiment. To prepare the participants for electrode placement, Everi cream was used to abrase the areas P3, Fz and forehead, selected using the 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Techologies, 2012). The AC cream was then applied on the electrodes: an active electrode was attached to P3. Reference electrodes are attached at Fz. Earth electrodes were attached to the forehead, near the hairline. The impedance levels were checked to be below 10Kohms.  <nl>Participants were given instructions and a practice trial first and were cued with an arrow for 35ms to let participants know which side to expect a stimulus, with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) set to 600ms-800ms in the practice trial. Different event markers were sent at stimulus onset for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli consisted of either large or small white bars shown either left or right on the screen on a black background for 50ms. The participants respond with either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. They underwent 12 practice trials including feedback about their response, before undergoing 4 blocks of 20 trials. After the practice trail was complete, the participants were given feedback on their performance.<nl>The participants were shortly warned that the real experiment was about to start. The random ISI was set to 200ms-1200ms<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>To covert the raw 9-13 Hz Alpha EEG to averaged data. Event markers from PsychoPy were sent to identify when stimuli were presented. Then looked at the period 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown. The data was rectified, which turns the negative values into positive, in order to show alpha activity regardless of it being excitatory or inhibitory. Averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of the outlying or extreme values. The rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were then suitable for statistical analysis. <nl>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics<nl>Firstly, to determine whether the data is parametric, a Shapiro-Wilk test was used and p&lt;.005. The p value is less than .05, therefore, a non-parametric equivalent had to be used: <nl>Wilcoxon signed ranks test. <nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions and a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed this difference was significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were consistent with the predicted hypothesis, as the median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left, than cue right and this supports the idea that alpha activity at P3 is different depending on which side participants are cued to expect a stimulus. <nl>The results also support previous research and the alpha inhibition hypothesis, as high alpha shows the inhibition of task irrelevant areas due to more activity in the left hemisphere (Klimesch et al., 2007), on the ipsilateral side of where the cue was presented. <nl>Although the results are consistent with the hypothesis, confounding variables may have altered the data to an extent. The participants moving around, may have altered the validity as gross motor movements may contaminate the EEG recordings, (Bell, M. A., &amp; Cuevas, K., 2012).<nl>Overall, there may be some areas for improvement to prevent confounding variables from affecting the data. To prevent motor movements, the participants should be given strict instructions to follow due to the sensitivity of the EEG. The researchers should monitor the participants to check if those instructions are being followed. However, despite these issues, the results can be granted as valid as the correct procedures were taken during the experiment, such as ensuring the impedance levels were below 10Kohms and in addition the results were expected due to previous research.", "Oh, to cook, erm, I don\u2019t really cook that much.

Lastly, another cognitive change that is observed is that the individuals affected by PTSD may lose interest in activities or avoid participating in them. These might be the activities that they enjoyed before the event occurred. <nl><nl>One of the biological changes observed is that the hippocampus is significantly smaller in individuals who develop PTSD. This region of the brain plays a role in memories related to emotion, therefore a smaller hippocampus represents a higher risk for developing PTSD after a traumatic event (Gilbertson 2002). Another biological change that is observed is the failure of the brain centres (e.g ventromedial frontal cortex) which dampens the activation of the brain's fear coordinating centre, the amygdala (Koenigs &amp; Grafman 2009). Therefore, the individual is unable to control the activation of fear after trauma."]}

Lastly, another cognitive change that is observed is that the individuals affected by PTSD may lose interest in activities or avoid participating in them. These might be the activities that they enjoyed before the event occurred. <nl><nl>One of the biological changes observed is that the hippocampus is significantly smaller in individuals who develop PTSD. This region of the brain plays a role in memories related to emotion, therefore a smaller hippocampus represents a higher risk for developing PTSD after a traumatic event (Gilbertson 2002). Another biological change that is observed is the failure of the brain centres (e.g ventromedial frontal cortex) which dampens the activation of the brain's fear coordinating centre, the amygdala (Koenigs &amp; Grafman 2009). Therefore, the individual is unable to control the activation of fear after trauma."]}

This might include an increase in negative emotions and the inability to experience positive ones. For instance, if a woman was sexually abused, she might experience anxiety or fear even after her abuse. A second cognitive change might be a severe lack of interest in activities. The women might have enjoyed spending time with her friends prior to her abuse but after the abuse she might resist and avoid any involvement in activities that were once pleasurable to her. She may also blame herself for getting sexually abused. Her choice of wearing a scandalous outfit might justify why someone abused her and this would be another cognitive change.<nl><nl>There are also biological changes associated with PTSD. The amygdala is responsible for the perception of emotions and the ventromedial frontal cortex is responsible for regulating responses to emotions. However, the frontal region with those who have PTSD does not function effectively and it does not dampen down the amygdala to the same degree as it does with people without the disorder. Another biological change may be a decrease in the size of the hippocampus, and this might explain why people with PTSD have difficulties consolidating their memories.<nl><nl><nl>Question 2: Outline the proposed role of operant conditioning in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).  How would a behavioural therapist treat OCD? (Both parts of this question are equally weighted). <nl><nl>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is made up of two components, obsessions and compulsions. The compulsion refers to the repetitive behaviour, for example, suffers may regularly wash their hands to reduce anxiety. The anxiety is caused by obsessive, irrational thoughts for example, the constant fear of germs and bacteria. According to the second stage of Mowrer\u2019s (1947) two stage theory, the removal of an aversive stimulus will negatively reinforce behaviour. In other words, the removal of anxiety is caused by the compulsive acts of washing hands \u2013 negative reinforcement and the relief from the anxiety might be rewarding to a sufferer \u2013 positive reinforcement. Thus, the behaviour will perpetuate because it is both negatively and positively reinforced.<nl><nl>Behavioural therapists treat OCD using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT involves the therapist and sufferer to actively break down and challenge irrational thoughts and behaviours through exposure and response prevention (ERP). This involves the gradual exposure to the feared object, this might be a fear of dirt and individuals are counter conditioned to learn new ways to control their compulsive behaviours around the fear. Once the fear is mastered, they will adopt these changes into their daily routine and try overcome their disorder.<nl><nl>Section B<nl>Critically evaluate the concept of dependence as an explanation for substance use.<nl>Dependence is an explanation for substance use and it refers to the need for drugs in order to function and in absence of the drugs, individuals may display withdrawal symptoms. There are two types of dependence, physical and mental. Mental dependence is when the use of a substance leads to a conditioned response to an emotion or feeling. For example, someone suffering from depression might rely heavily on benzodiazepines to evoke positive emotions such as relaxation and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, this could lead to drug misuse and the dependence explanation has helped lead to practical applications to avoid this occurring. For instance, doctors will prescribe benzodiazepines only in serious cases and for less than 4 weeks to avoid dependencyaddiction. This explanation has led to a greater understanding about drugs and positive social changes.<nl><nl>The dependence explanation is limited however, because substance use could also be a result of genetic predispositions. Kendler &amp; Prescott (1998) support this notion through their research on 1,934 twins, ranging in age from 22 to 62. They were given interviews about their drug addictions to cocaine and marijuana. Kendler reported that whilst examining pairs, it was evident that the concordance rates for both twins using drugs was higher in monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ) twins. The concordance rate for cocaine use in MZ twins was 54% and in DZ twins it was 42%. Thus, this gives weight to the influence of genetics on substance use. While it is important to understand the role of heredity on substance use, environmental factors are also as important. These factors may include stress, trauma, or community pressure. Exposure to trauma has been linked closely to substance use. Witnessing death or experiencing assault would be a traumatic experience and these people are more likely to take drugs. This may be because trauma symptoms may become more manageable after self-medicating. Turning to drugs may be the easier escape for some individuals when dealing with environmental difficulties. Thus, substance use may be a result of genetic and environmental factors interacting so therefore, a diathesis stress model should be proposed.<nl><nl>Behaviourists stress the important role operant conditioning has on behaviour. Operant conditioning as proposed by Skinner (1938) can be applied to substance use. For instance, people suffering from trauma may use drugs as a coping mechanism to alleviate their trauma related symptoms (this might include shocks and mood swings). Skinner referred to negative reinforcement as the continual of behaviour to remove any aversive outcomes. Similarly, individuals might repeat the act of taking drugs because it temporarily removes their symptoms. Another concept of operant conditioning is positive reinforcement. This refers to the continual of behaviour to gain a reward. Drugs are involved in the activation of dopamine pathways. These pathways stimulate pleasure and reward thus might also explain why people continue to take drugs. Therefore, the dependent explanation can not alone explain substance use as a variety of factors and explanations might account for it.", "Oh, to cook, erm, I don\u2019t really cook that much.

Erm, she, the girl sitting down, is laughing. And the woman standing up is smiling a little bit, but she\u2019s not looking directly at her.

The girl has got her leather jacket on and some boots, and the background is, erm, is black with white dots making up the circle, and then a bigger circle, bigger circle, etc., etc. Erm, and maybe like I said also in a study session, erm, kind of setting, like students. They\u2019re both looking at someone else who\u2019s not in the picture, although there is a hand, so I guess that\u2019s the person\u2019s hand.

So, I\u2019d try and like, maybe, one or two days a week, try and not have any meat, just, obviously, it\u2019s not a particularly good thing but I just couldn\u2019t, I couldn\u2019t commit to it all the time.<new>Erm, I mean, it didn\u2019t last very long  <laugh>  but I thought it would be a good thing to do.

I can\u2019t eat raw cheese \u2013 I don\u2019t know if raw\u2019s the word but, erm, melted cheese. So, I found it quite hard to be a vegetarian when I don\u2019t eat most of their foods either.

How would a behavioural therapist treat OCD? (Both parts of this question are equally weighted). <nl><nl>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is made up of two components, obsessions and compulsions. The compulsion refers to the repetitive behaviour, for example, suffers may regularly wash their hands to reduce anxiety. The anxiety is caused by obsessive, irrational thoughts for example, the constant fear of germs and bacteria. According to the second stage of Mowrer\u2019s (1947) two stage theory, the removal of an aversive stimulus will negatively reinforce behaviour. In other words, the removal of anxiety is caused by the compulsive acts of washing hands \u2013 negative reinforcement and the relief from the anxiety might be rewarding to a sufferer \u2013 positive reinforcement. Thus, the behaviour will perpetuate because it is both negatively and positively reinforced.<nl><nl>Behavioural therapists treat OCD using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT involves the therapist and sufferer to actively break down and challenge irrational thoughts and behaviours through exposure and response prevention (ERP). This involves the gradual exposure to the feared object, this might be a fear of dirt and individuals are counter conditioned to learn new ways to control their compulsive behaviours around the fear. Once the fear is mastered, they will adopt these changes into their daily routine and try overcome their disorder.<nl><nl>Section B<nl>Critically evaluate the concept of dependence as an explanation for substance use.<nl>Dependence is an explanation for substance use and it refers to the need for drugs in order to function and in absence of the drugs, individuals may display withdrawal symptoms. There are two types of dependence, physical and mental. Mental dependence is when the use of a substance leads to a conditioned response to an emotion or feeling. For example, someone suffering from depression might rely heavily on benzodiazepines to evoke positive emotions such as relaxation and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, this could lead to drug misuse and the dependence explanation has helped lead to practical applications to avoid this occurring. For instance, doctors will prescribe benzodiazepines only in serious cases and for less than 4 weeks to avoid dependencyaddiction. This explanation has led to a greater understanding about drugs and positive social changes.<nl><nl>The dependence explanation is limited however, because substance use could also be a result of genetic predispositions. Kendler &amp; Prescott (1998) support this notion through their research on 1,934 twins, ranging in age from 22 to 62. They were given interviews about their drug addictions to cocaine and marijuana. Kendler reported that whilst examining pairs, it was evident that the concordance rates for both twins using drugs was higher in monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ) twins. The concordance rate for cocaine use in MZ twins was 54% and in DZ twins it was 42%. Thus, this gives weight to the influence of genetics on substance use. While it is important to understand the role of heredity on substance use, environmental factors are also as important. These factors may include stress, trauma, or community pressure. Exposure to trauma has been linked closely to substance use. Witnessing death or experiencing assault would be a traumatic experience and these people are more likely to take drugs. This may be because trauma symptoms may become more manageable after self-medicating. Turning to drugs may be the easier escape for some individuals when dealing with environmental difficulties. Thus, substance use may be a result of genetic and environmental factors interacting so therefore, a diathesis stress model should be proposed.<nl><nl>Behaviourists stress the important role operant conditioning has on behaviour. Operant conditioning as proposed by Skinner (1938) can be applied to substance use. For instance, people suffering from trauma may use drugs as a coping mechanism to alleviate their trauma related symptoms (this might include shocks and mood swings). Skinner referred to negative reinforcement as the continual of behaviour to remove any aversive outcomes. Similarly, individuals might repeat the act of taking drugs because it temporarily removes their symptoms. Another concept of operant conditioning is positive reinforcement. This refers to the continual of behaviour to gain a reward. Drugs are involved in the activation of dopamine pathways. These pathways stimulate pleasure and reward thus might also explain why people continue to take drugs. Therefore, the dependent explanation can not alone explain substance use as a variety of factors and explanations might account for it.", "Okay.<new>Li- okay, so I start off with breakfast.

Participants from the general population volunteered to participate.   <nl><nl>Design <nl>The design was a 3x2 mixed ANOVA, the 2 independent variables (IV) were age as a between-subject with three levels (young, young-old and old-old). Another IV was a task as a within-subject with 2 levels (single and dual-task). The dependent variable was the proportion of correctly identified responses (PCR) after corrected false recognition presented in decimal factors (a number between 0-1).<nl> <nl>Materials  <nl>The materials that were used were four lists of 30 words from the Toronto Word Pool (Friendly, Franklin, Hoffman, &amp; Rubin, 1982) and a metronome to measure the response time in seconds. <nl> <nl>Procedure  <nl>Firstly, the researchers obtained an informed consent from all the participants. After, the participants were shown a list of 30 words before they were given a word recognition task where the 30 previously seen targets were presented with 30 previously unseen words. Words were moderately concrete, low imageability words. Four lists of 30 words were used, participants were asked to complete a mental arithmetic task between study and recognition stages. After, the participants had completed two consecutive word recognition tasks. One of the task on their own and one concurrently with a finger tapping task, this time they had to keep time with a metronome. Latin square was used to change the order in which the participants completed the dual and single tasks.<nl>Results <nl><nl>Main effect of age group<nl>Table 1. showed the mean recall for the young group was the highest compared to the mean of young-old and old-old.

The 95% CI ranges do not overlap for the old-old participants compared to the other of participants, therefore, suggesting that the population means would be different.

It\u2019s, I\u2019ve never been a big eater, it\u2019s just personally the way I am, it\u2019s not because I don\u2019t have an appetite, I just don\u2019t find the time to do it. Erm, but yeah, I think it changed drastically. And, obviously, I\u2019ve been working throughout, erm, the whole pandemic so, erm, work has influenced me like to, to eat slightly less in the day. Erm, like, for example, obviously, I wouldn\u2019t have my lunch so my lunch would be combined into dinner and, you know, erm, evening meal kind of thing. So, yeah, it hasn\u2019t really influmen-, influenced me a lot. Maybe it\u2019s influenced me in terms of the fact that I\u2019ve done working so I have not been eating as much. But yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it.<new>Erm, I don\u2019t have a particular food that I hate but I hate an ingredient in food and it\u2019s ginger. I just can\u2019t stand the taste of it. Anything that has ginger in it, like, for example, if I\u2019m, if I\u2019m going to like an Asian restaurant, erm, and they have, it has ginger, it just ruins the whole meal for me. I think it\u2019s t-, way too overpowering and I just don\u2019t understand how people can enjoy it, really. I just, personally, I can\u2019t stomach ginger. It makes me, psh, just makes me feel ill.<new>Erm, mm. Let me think. I think it would be a jackfruit. I think that\u2019s what they\u2019re called. Erm, I think it\u2019s like an Asian kind of, erm, it\u2019s like a huge. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s Asian or just gen-, like generally kind of like an exotic fruit. Erm, but it\u2019s like a huge, green, like spikey kind of melon looking thing but, obviously, when you cut inside of it, then there\u2019s like a huge, strong smell of like rotting like, rotten fruit, basically. But it has a really, really sweet taste, which is really strange. Erm, I tasted some at my friend\u2019s house one time and I could never forget about it, honestly. It\u2019s, it was so strange, it was a real experience.", "Erm, so, in the first picture, I can see two young ladies, erm, er, one in stripy black and white top with blonde hair. And, er, another young lady who I can see smiling, maybe laughing at, erm, at someone\u2019s joke and she\u2019s wearing a denim jacket. And they both seem to be busy at doing something. Er, so maybe, they\u2019re doing uni work or any kind of work. Er, but they do look young so they view, they\u2019re probably, erm, uni students. And in the second picture, I can see two young lads, two young gentlemen, erm, sitting in front of a laptop. Erm, both of them are just, they\u2019re probably either friends or just two people who are working together on a project. Erm, yeah, and, er, one of them\u2019s wearing a red and black, erm, top. And one of them\u2019s wearing like a floral kind of top. And the last picture, erm, I can see, again, two young people, erm, sitting down, doing some work. Erm, they\u2019re wearing kind of blackish clothes, dark clothes, erm, even the background is kind of dark. Erm, but they're both smiling, erm. In all pictures, they bo-, like they all seem to, erm, be kind of doing something, engaging in something, most likely work like uni work or college work. Erm. So yeah."]}

One is standing up and leaning over a little bit. She is wearing a black and white stripey t-shirt and some jeans, and then sat down next to her is another girl in a leather jacket \u2013 not a leather jacket, a denim jacket. Erm, she, the girl sitting down, is laughing. And the woman standing up is smiling a little bit, but she\u2019s not looking directly at her. Erm, maybe they\u2019re looking at something together, but that\u2019s not in the picture. The picture is just the girls. The background is just plain white. Erm, there might be some shapes underneath it, I can\u2019t really see. But for the most part it\u2019s either white or blocked out, so the focus of the picture is the girls. Erm, they look like maybe they\u2019re friends or maybe they\u2019re in a study group together, like they could be students. They look about student age. I\u2019d say like early twenties kind of age. And yeah, that\u2019s the first image. The second picture has got two boys in it, and the fo- the main, at the front of the picture is a laptop, is an Apple MacBook. Erm, and the background is, I think they\u2019re in like a study booth, maybe. Erm, there\u2019s a table at the front, and then the back is like black with green spots on it, different sizes, dots. And then one of the boys is wearing a t-shirt with flowers on it and pink writing, and he\u2019s got an earring in. And the other boy is wearing like a, I think it\u2019s like plaid or flannel, or whatever, a shirt over a white t-shirt. And he is looking at the laptop, and the other boy is looking at him. Again, I think students, in probably a study session. I think they might be in a study group together. They both ar- they seem happy to be there,  <laugh>  I don\u2019t know, kind of not outwardly smiling but a bit of a smile. Erm, seems like they get on, but I don\u2019t know if I would say, they don\u2019t really look like best friends I would say. So maybe they\u2019ve met in a study group, or maybe they\u2019re just acquaintances, I don\u2019t know. And then the third picture is, I guess again might be a study situation, because there\u2019s a boy in it holding a book that looks, it\u2019s quite a thick book, so maybe a textbook. Erm, they, there\u2019s a table at the front, like a glass table, and they\u2019re both sat, there are two people in it, both sat on a bench, I think? Erm, sorry, this one\u2019s a boy and a girl. The boy is holding a textbook and he\u2019s got a coat on, and some, I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s, I don\u2019t know. The girl has got her leather jacket on and some boots, and the background is, erm, is black with white dots making up the circle, and then a bigger circle, bigger circle, etc., etc. Erm, and maybe like I said also in a study session, erm, kind of setting, like students. They\u2019re both looking at someone else who\u2019s not in the picture, although there is a hand, so I guess that\u2019s the person\u2019s hand. And they\u2019re both looking quite at them, not each other. So I guess that person\u2019s speaking and they\u2019re both listening. Again they\u2019re both smiling, so obviously comfortable in the situation. Erm, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know about their relationship. That\u2019s not really clear in the picture, whether they\u2019re friends or just been again put together as part of maybe a project or something. And yeah, is that enough?"]}

Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001)."]}

It is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued left than when cued right. Data from 38 participants was used. Within-subjects design. Independent variable had two levels: cue left, cue right. Dependant variable was the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V). EEG electrodes were attached to relevant areas using the 1020 system. The results showed that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions. The results are consistent with the hypothesis and previous research.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>The alpha inhibition hypothesis refers to the concept that high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha wave in the relaxation state has higher power spectrum than in the attention state. Yaomanee, K., Pan-ngum, S., &amp; Ayuthaya, P. I. N. (2012). Concluding that alpha activity can be modulated by attention, thus meaning that alpha activity is reduced when we pay attention to stimuli.<nl>This experiment is a partial replication of Sauseng et al., (2005). Overall, 22 participants used, and they were given a cued visual attention task. Cued with a fixation cross for 34ms, then an arrow cue would indicate which hemifield a target would appear in. There was a 50% chance of being cued left or right, 75% of the trials were valid and 25% of trials were invalid. Results indicated that parietal regions showed stronger alpha lower band frequency suppression contralateral to the attended hemifield. Similar results for upper frequencies. Therefore, the alpha inhibition hypothesis is supported by these findings as there is stronger alpha activity in the task irrelevant brain areas. <nl>To further support these findings, Mazahari et al., (2014) used 57 adolescent participants: 23 normally developing, 17 who have combined subtype ADHD (inattention and hyperactivity) and 17 who have predominantly inattentive ADHD. Used a cued flanker task. Response preparation cue predicted 84% accuracy, or a null cue was shown which had no information about correct response. Overall participants showed alpha suppression following response preparation cues, greater for normally developing participants and least for inattentive ADHD subtypes. The indicative alpha suppression supports the idea that alpha activity can be modulated by attention \u2013 thus being reduced when participants attended to the stimuli.<nl>Following on previous studies, it is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued to expect a stimulus on the left than when cued to expect a stimulus on the right, when recording from the left parietal lobe (P3).  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>To begin with, 39 undergraduate participants were obtained by volunteer sample, however, one participant was removed as they were only available for one of the two conditions: 38 participants overall. <nl>Design <nl>Within subject\u2019s design, with an independent variable of cue direction with two levels: either left or right. The dependent variable is the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V).<nl><nl>Materials <nl>A Biopac MP36 was used to record alpha range activity and receive event markers for cue left and cue right conditions. EEG electrodes which were attached to the head. AC Cream and Everi cream was used, in preparation prior to the attachment of electrodes. The software PsychoPy was used to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. Stimuli were used to present to the visual fields such as: arrow cues left (&lt;) and right (&gt;), large bar (Figure A) and small bar (Figure B) stimuli. <nl><figure><nl> <nl>Procedure <nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz. Digital channels were set up to receive the event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker. A calculation channel was also set up to record the activity in the alpha frequency range of (8 - 13 Hz). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. <nl>Before preparing the participants, they gave informed consent and were briefed on their right to withdraw from the experiment. To prepare the participants for electrode placement, Everi cream was used to abrase the areas P3, Fz and forehead, selected using the 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Techologies, 2012). The AC cream was then applied on the electrodes: an active electrode was attached to P3. Reference electrodes are attached at Fz. Earth electrodes were attached to the forehead, near the hairline. The impedance levels were checked to be below 10Kohms.  <nl>Participants were given instructions and a practice trial first and were cued with an arrow for 35ms to let participants know which side to expect a stimulus, with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) set to 600ms-800ms in the practice trial. Different event markers were sent at stimulus onset for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli consisted of either large or small white bars shown either left or right on the screen on a black background for 50ms. The participants respond with either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. They underwent 12 practice trials including feedback about their response, before undergoing 4 blocks of 20 trials. After the practice trail was complete, the participants were given feedback on their performance.<nl>The participants were shortly warned that the real experiment was about to start. The random ISI was set to 200ms-1200ms<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>To covert the raw 9-13 Hz Alpha EEG to averaged data. Event markers from PsychoPy were sent to identify when stimuli were presented. Then looked at the period 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown. The data was rectified, which turns the negative values into positive, in order to show alpha activity regardless of it being excitatory or inhibitory. Averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of the outlying or extreme values. The rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were then suitable for statistical analysis. <nl>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics<nl>Firstly, to determine whether the data is parametric, a Shapiro-Wilk test was used and p&lt;.005. The p value is less than .05, therefore, a non-parametric equivalent had to be used: <nl>Wilcoxon signed ranks test. <nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions and a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed this difference was significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were consistent with the predicted hypothesis, as the median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left, than cue right and this supports the idea that alpha activity at P3 is different depending on which side participants are cued to expect a stimulus. <nl>The results also support previous research and the alpha inhibition hypothesis, as high alpha shows the inhibition of task irrelevant areas due to more activity in the left hemisphere (Klimesch et al., 2007), on the ipsilateral side of where the cue was presented. <nl>Although the results are consistent with the hypothesis, confounding variables may have altered the data to an extent. The participants moving around, may have altered the validity as gross motor movements may contaminate the EEG recordings, (Bell, M. A., &amp; Cuevas, K., 2012).<nl>Overall, there may be some areas for improvement to prevent confounding variables from affecting the data. To prevent motor movements, the participants should be given strict instructions to follow due to the sensitivity of the EEG. The researchers should monitor the participants to check if those instructions are being followed. However, despite these issues, the results can be granted as valid as the correct procedures were taken during the experiment, such as ensuring the impedance levels were below 10Kohms and in addition the results were expected due to previous research.", "Erm, yeah, just yeah.

Within this task they were presented with the 30 previously seen and 30 previously unseen targets. The words were moderately concrete and low imageability. Participants were assigned a mental arithmetic task to complete between study and recognition stages. They completed two consecutive word recognition tasks: one on its own and one concurrently with a finger tapping task where a metronome was used to track time per second (1Hz). In order to counterbalance, a Latin square was used to minimize order effect. False recognition was corrected and presented as decimal fractions at the end where the numbers were between 0 and 1 indicated the proportion of correctly recognised words.

Another IV was a task as a within-subject with 2 levels (single and dual-task). The dependent variable was the proportion of correctly identified responses (PCR) after corrected false recognition presented in decimal factors (a number between 0-1).<nl> <nl>Materials  <nl>The materials that were used were four lists of 30 words from the Toronto Word Pool (Friendly, Franklin, Hoffman, &amp; Rubin, 1982) and a metronome to measure the response time in seconds. <nl> <nl>Procedure  <nl>Firstly, the researchers obtained an informed consent from all the participants. After, the participants were shown a list of 30 words before they were given a word recognition task where the 30 previously seen targets were presented with 30 previously unseen words. Words were moderately concrete, low imageability words. Four lists of 30 words were used, participants were asked to complete a mental arithmetic task between study and recognition stages. After, the participants had completed two consecutive word recognition tasks. One of the task on their own and one concurrently with a finger tapping task, this time they had to keep time with a metronome. Latin square was used to change the order in which the participants completed the dual and single tasks.<nl>Results <nl><nl>Main effect of age group<nl>Table 1. showed the mean recall for the young group was the highest compared to the mean of young-old and old-old. The main effect of age displayed that this difference was significant, with a large effect size of 51%in PCR (F(2,57)=74.9,p&lt;0.001,n2=0.52). 95% CI ranges did not overlap suggesting that the population would be different. <nl> <nl>Main effect of task<nl><nl><table><nl>Table 2. showed that the mean score for correctly recognised words in single task was higher compared to the mean of dual-task. The main effect of the task was significant, with a small effect of 1.8% in PCR (F(1,57)=4.32,p&lt;0.042, n2=0.018 and 95% CI ranges do not overlap which suggest that the population means would be different.  <nl> <nl>Interaction between age group and task<nl><nl><table><nl>Table 3. Showed the mean for single and dual tasks for young and young-old participants was higher compared to the mean for single and dual tasks for old-old participants. The interaction between the age and task was significant, with a small effect size of 3.7% in PCR (F(2,57)=4.53,p&lt;0.001, n2= 0.037). The 95% CI ranges do not overlap for the old-old participants compared to the other of participants, therefore, suggesting that the population means would be different. Lastly, T-test displayed that there was a significant difference between means."]}

Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent (CI) than the colour congruent (CC) condition. (M= 966.8, SD= 405.1). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( T= 403, n= 59, p= &lt; .001). Data shows that participants took longer to correctly identify the font colours when they were incongruent with the colour of the words written. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>The results that were found were consistent with previous research of Stroop (1935) and supported the hypothesis as participants did have a slower reaction time when identifying incongruent font colours and had a faster reaction time for the congruent condition. The reaction time was faster for the congruent condition because Cattell (1886) argued that wording reading is automatic therefore it\u2019s quicker for individuals to read the word represented to them in that condition. However, different research finding has been reported from a similar stroop task called emotional stroop (Williams et al. 1996). It was found that the emotional Stroop involves only emotional and neutral words and that color does not affect reaction time because it does not conflict with word meaning. The classic stroop test shows that the reaction time is slower because there is a conflict between an incongruent color and the word. Furthermore,  Salthouse and Meinz (1995) argue that even though age differences specific to stroop interference were minimal, other research may show the relationship between age and Stroop interference was still significant (West &amp; Baylis, 1998). <nl><nl>Finally, some of the methodological issues regarding the experiment were that volunteer sampling was used, only university students participated. Findings cannot be generalised to those who did not volunteer and the finding may not be representative of the whole population. An improvement could be made by selecting people of all ages not just university students. Another issue was that the experiment was not completed in a controlled environment, this means they could have had help from others. Another improvement could be that all the participants complete the test in a psychology lab. Also there may have been extraneous variables which may have affected the results, e.g. some participants may have completed at 9am, they would most likely been tired and have had a slower reaction time.

It is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued left than when cued right. Data from 38 participants was used. Within-subjects design. Independent variable had two levels: cue left, cue right. Dependant variable was the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V). EEG electrodes were attached to relevant areas using the 1020 system. The results showed that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions. The results are consistent with the hypothesis and previous research.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>The alpha inhibition hypothesis refers to the concept that high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha wave in the relaxation state has higher power spectrum than in the attention state. Yaomanee, K., Pan-ngum, S., &amp; Ayuthaya, P. I. N. (2012). Concluding that alpha activity can be modulated by attention, thus meaning that alpha activity is reduced when we pay attention to stimuli.<nl>This experiment is a partial replication of Sauseng et al., (2005). Overall, 22 participants used, and they were given a cued visual attention task. Cued with a fixation cross for 34ms, then an arrow cue would indicate which hemifield a target would appear in. There was a 50% chance of being cued left or right, 75% of the trials were valid and 25% of trials were invalid. Results indicated that parietal regions showed stronger alpha lower band frequency suppression contralateral to the attended hemifield. Similar results for upper frequencies. Therefore, the alpha inhibition hypothesis is supported by these findings as there is stronger alpha activity in the task irrelevant brain areas. <nl>To further support these findings, Mazahari et al., (2014) used 57 adolescent participants: 23 normally developing, 17 who have combined subtype ADHD (inattention and hyperactivity) and 17 who have predominantly inattentive ADHD. Used a cued flanker task. Response preparation cue predicted 84% accuracy, or a null cue was shown which had no information about correct response. Overall participants showed alpha suppression following response preparation cues, greater for normally developing participants and least for inattentive ADHD subtypes. The indicative alpha suppression supports the idea that alpha activity can be modulated by attention \u2013 thus being reduced when participants attended to the stimuli.<nl>Following on previous studies, it is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued to expect a stimulus on the left than when cued to expect a stimulus on the right, when recording from the left parietal lobe (P3).  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>To begin with, 39 undergraduate participants were obtained by volunteer sample, however, one participant was removed as they were only available for one of the two conditions: 38 participants overall. <nl>Design <nl>Within subject\u2019s design, with an independent variable of cue direction with two levels: either left or right. The dependent variable is the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V).<nl><nl>Materials <nl>A Biopac MP36 was used to record alpha range activity and receive event markers for cue left and cue right conditions. EEG electrodes which were attached to the head. AC Cream and Everi cream was used, in preparation prior to the attachment of electrodes. The software PsychoPy was used to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. Stimuli were used to present to the visual fields such as: arrow cues left (&lt;) and right (&gt;), large bar (Figure A) and small bar (Figure B) stimuli. <nl><figure><nl> <nl>Procedure <nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz. Digital channels were set up to receive the event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker. A calculation channel was also set up to record the activity in the alpha frequency range of (8 - 13 Hz). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. <nl>Before preparing the participants, they gave informed consent and were briefed on their right to withdraw from the experiment. To prepare the participants for electrode placement, Everi cream was used to abrase the areas P3, Fz and forehead, selected using the 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Techologies, 2012). The AC cream was then applied on the electrodes: an active electrode was attached to P3. Reference electrodes are attached at Fz. Earth electrodes were attached to the forehead, near the hairline. The impedance levels were checked to be below 10Kohms.  <nl>Participants were given instructions and a practice trial first and were cued with an arrow for 35ms to let participants know which side to expect a stimulus, with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) set to 600ms-800ms in the practice trial. Different event markers were sent at stimulus onset for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli consisted of either large or small white bars shown either left or right on the screen on a black background for 50ms. The participants respond with either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. They underwent 12 practice trials including feedback about their response, before undergoing 4 blocks of 20 trials. After the practice trail was complete, the participants were given feedback on their performance.<nl>The participants were shortly warned that the real experiment was about to start. The random ISI was set to 200ms-1200ms<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>To covert the raw 9-13 Hz Alpha EEG to averaged data. Event markers from PsychoPy were sent to identify when stimuli were presented. Then looked at the period 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown. The data was rectified, which turns the negative values into positive, in order to show alpha activity regardless of it being excitatory or inhibitory. Averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of the outlying or extreme values. The rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were then suitable for statistical analysis. <nl>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics<nl>Firstly, to determine whether the data is parametric, a Shapiro-Wilk test was used and p&lt;.005. The p value is less than .05, therefore, a non-parametric equivalent had to be used: <nl>Wilcoxon signed ranks test. <nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions and a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed this difference was significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were consistent with the predicted hypothesis, as the median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left, than cue right and this supports the idea that alpha activity at P3 is different depending on which side participants are cued to expect a stimulus. <nl>The results also support previous research and the alpha inhibition hypothesis, as high alpha shows the inhibition of task irrelevant areas due to more activity in the left hemisphere (Klimesch et al., 2007), on the ipsilateral side of where the cue was presented. <nl>Although the results are consistent with the hypothesis, confounding variables may have altered the data to an extent. The participants moving around, may have altered the validity as gross motor movements may contaminate the EEG recordings, (Bell, M. A., &amp; Cuevas, K., 2012).<nl>Overall, there may be some areas for improvement to prevent confounding variables from affecting the data. To prevent motor movements, the participants should be given strict instructions to follow due to the sensitivity of the EEG. The researchers should monitor the participants to check if those instructions are being followed. However, despite these issues, the results can be granted as valid as the correct procedures were taken during the experiment, such as ensuring the impedance levels were below 10Kohms and in addition the results were expected due to previous research.", "Hello,<nl><nl>I am emailing you in regards of the <module> tasks. <nl><nl><nl>Student ID: <student_number><nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hello, <nl><nl>I have recently had problems with one of the online quizzes for <module>.

But yeah.", "Unipolar depression is a form of major depression, this is when the patient focuses on negative emotions. Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001)."]}

Lastly, another cognitive change that is observed is that the individuals affected by PTSD may lose interest in activities or avoid participating in them. These might be the activities that they enjoyed before the event occurred. <nl><nl>One of the biological changes observed is that the hippocampus is significantly smaller in individuals who develop PTSD. This region of the brain plays a role in memories related to emotion, therefore a smaller hippocampus represents a higher risk for developing PTSD after a traumatic event (Gilbertson 2002). Another biological change that is observed is the failure of the brain centres (e.g ventromedial frontal cortex) which dampens the activation of the brain's fear coordinating centre, the amygdala (Koenigs &amp; Grafman 2009). Therefore, the individual is unable to control the activation of fear after trauma."]}

Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent (CI) than the colour congruent (CC) condition. (M= 966.8, SD= 405.1). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( T= 403, n= 59, p= &lt; .001). Data shows that participants took longer to correctly identify the font colours when they were incongruent with the colour of the words written. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>The results that were found were consistent with previous research of Stroop (1935) and supported the hypothesis as participants did have a slower reaction time when identifying incongruent font colours and had a faster reaction time for the congruent condition. The reaction time was faster for the congruent condition because Cattell (1886) argued that wording reading is automatic therefore it\u2019s quicker for individuals to read the word represented to them in that condition. However, different research finding has been reported from a similar stroop task called emotional stroop (Williams et al. 1996). It was found that the emotional Stroop involves only emotional and neutral words and that color does not affect reaction time because it does not conflict with word meaning. The classic stroop test shows that the reaction time is slower because there is a conflict between an incongruent color and the word. Furthermore,  Salthouse and Meinz (1995) argue that even though age differences specific to stroop interference were minimal, other research may show the relationship between age and Stroop interference was still significant (West &amp; Baylis, 1998). <nl><nl>Finally, some of the methodological issues regarding the experiment were that volunteer sampling was used, only university students participated. Findings cannot be generalised to those who did not volunteer and the finding may not be representative of the whole population. An improvement could be made by selecting people of all ages not just university students. Another issue was that the experiment was not completed in a controlled environment, this means they could have had help from others. Another improvement could be that all the participants complete the test in a psychology lab. Also there may have been extraneous variables which may have affected the results, e.g. some participants may have completed at 9am, they would most likely been tired and have had a slower reaction time. This can be improved by making sure all students complete the test at the same time."]}

Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001).", "Erm, yeah, just yeah.

This might include an increase in negative emotions and the inability to experience positive ones. For instance, if a woman was sexually abused, she might experience anxiety or fear even after her abuse. A second cognitive change might be a severe lack of interest in activities. The women might have enjoyed spending time with her friends prior to her abuse but after the abuse she might resist and avoid any involvement in activities that were once pleasurable to her. She may also blame herself for getting sexually abused. Her choice of wearing a scandalous outfit might justify why someone abused her and this would be another cognitive change.<nl><nl>There are also biological changes associated with PTSD. The amygdala is responsible for the perception of emotions and the ventromedial frontal cortex is responsible for regulating responses to emotions. However, the frontal region with those who have PTSD does not function effectively and it does not dampen down the amygdala to the same degree as it does with people without the disorder. Another biological change may be a decrease in the size of the hippocampus, and this might explain why people with PTSD have difficulties consolidating their memories.<nl><nl><nl>Question 2: Outline the proposed role of operant conditioning in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).  How would a behavioural therapist treat OCD? (Both parts of this question are equally weighted). <nl><nl>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is made up of two components, obsessions and compulsions. The compulsion refers to the repetitive behaviour, for example, suffers may regularly wash their hands to reduce anxiety. The anxiety is caused by obsessive, irrational thoughts for example, the constant fear of germs and bacteria. According to the second stage of Mowrer\u2019s (1947) two stage theory, the removal of an aversive stimulus will negatively reinforce behaviour. In other words, the removal of anxiety is caused by the compulsive acts of washing hands \u2013 negative reinforcement and the relief from the anxiety might be rewarding to a sufferer \u2013 positive reinforcement. Thus, the behaviour will perpetuate because it is both negatively and positively reinforced.<nl><nl>Behavioural therapists treat OCD using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT involves the therapist and sufferer to actively break down and challenge irrational thoughts and behaviours through exposure and response prevention (ERP). This involves the gradual exposure to the feared object, this might be a fear of dirt and individuals are counter conditioned to learn new ways to control their compulsive behaviours around the fear. Once the fear is mastered, they will adopt these changes into their daily routine and try overcome their disorder.<nl><nl>Section B<nl>Critically evaluate the concept of dependence as an explanation for substance use.<nl>Dependence is an explanation for substance use and it refers to the need for drugs in order to function and in absence of the drugs, individuals may display withdrawal symptoms. There are two types of dependence, physical and mental. Mental dependence is when the use of a substance leads to a conditioned response to an emotion or feeling. For example, someone suffering from depression might rely heavily on benzodiazepines to evoke positive emotions such as relaxation and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, this could lead to drug misuse and the dependence explanation has helped lead to practical applications to avoid this occurring. For instance, doctors will prescribe benzodiazepines only in serious cases and for less than 4 weeks to avoid dependencyaddiction. This explanation has led to a greater understanding about drugs and positive social changes.<nl><nl>The dependence explanation is limited however, because substance use could also be a result of genetic predispositions. Kendler &amp; Prescott (1998) support this notion through their research on 1,934 twins, ranging in age from 22 to 62. They were given interviews about their drug addictions to cocaine and marijuana. Kendler reported that whilst examining pairs, it was evident that the concordance rates for both twins using drugs was higher in monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ) twins. The concordance rate for cocaine use in MZ twins was 54% and in DZ twins it was 42%. Thus, this gives weight to the influence of genetics on substance use. While it is important to understand the role of heredity on substance use, environmental factors are also as important. These factors may include stress, trauma, or community pressure. Exposure to trauma has been linked closely to substance use. Witnessing death or experiencing assault would be a traumatic experience and these people are more likely to take drugs. This may be because trauma symptoms may become more manageable after self-medicating. Turning to drugs may be the easier escape for some individuals when dealing with environmental difficulties. Thus, substance use may be a result of genetic and environmental factors interacting so therefore, a diathesis stress model should be proposed.<nl><nl>Behaviourists stress the important role operant conditioning has on behaviour. Operant conditioning as proposed by Skinner (1938) can be applied to substance use. For instance, people suffering from trauma may use drugs as a coping mechanism to alleviate their trauma related symptoms (this might include shocks and mood swings). Skinner referred to negative reinforcement as the continual of behaviour to remove any aversive outcomes. Similarly, individuals might repeat the act of taking drugs because it temporarily removes their symptoms. Another concept of operant conditioning is positive reinforcement. This refers to the continual of behaviour to gain a reward. Drugs are involved in the activation of dopamine pathways. These pathways stimulate pleasure and reward thus might also explain why people continue to take drugs. Therefore, the dependent explanation can not alone explain substance use as a variety of factors and explanations might account for it.", "Hi,<nl><nl>So I've enclosed a copy of part of my IPA analysis on the transcript and through some of my annotations I came up with a main theme as <topic> because my participant was questioning his belief and always confused.

Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001)."]}

This might include an increase in negative emotions and the inability to experience positive ones. For instance, if a woman was sexually abused, she might experience anxiety or fear even after her abuse. A second cognitive change might be a severe lack of interest in activities. The women might have enjoyed spending time with her friends prior to her abuse but after the abuse she might resist and avoid any involvement in activities that were once pleasurable to her. She may also blame herself for getting sexually abused. Her choice of wearing a scandalous outfit might justify why someone abused her and this would be another cognitive change.<nl><nl>There are also biological changes associated with PTSD. The amygdala is responsible for the perception of emotions and the ventromedial frontal cortex is responsible for regulating responses to emotions. However, the frontal region with those who have PTSD does not function effectively and it does not dampen down the amygdala to the same degree as it does with people without the disorder. Another biological change may be a decrease in the size of the hippocampus, and this might explain why people with PTSD have difficulties consolidating their memories.<nl><nl><nl>Question 2: Outline the proposed role of operant conditioning in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).  How would a behavioural therapist treat OCD? (Both parts of this question are equally weighted). <nl><nl>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is made up of two components, obsessions and compulsions. The compulsion refers to the repetitive behaviour, for example, suffers may regularly wash their hands to reduce anxiety. The anxiety is caused by obsessive, irrational thoughts for example, the constant fear of germs and bacteria. According to the second stage of Mowrer\u2019s (1947) two stage theory, the removal of an aversive stimulus will negatively reinforce behaviour. In other words, the removal of anxiety is caused by the compulsive acts of washing hands \u2013 negative reinforcement and the relief from the anxiety might be rewarding to a sufferer \u2013 positive reinforcement. Thus, the behaviour will perpetuate because it is both negatively and positively reinforced.<nl><nl>Behavioural therapists treat OCD using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT involves the therapist and sufferer to actively break down and challenge irrational thoughts and behaviours through exposure and response prevention (ERP). This involves the gradual exposure to the feared object, this might be a fear of dirt and individuals are counter conditioned to learn new ways to control their compulsive behaviours around the fear. Once the fear is mastered, they will adopt these changes into their daily routine and try overcome their disorder.<nl><nl>Section B<nl>Critically evaluate the concept of dependence as an explanation for substance use.<nl>Dependence is an explanation for substance use and it refers to the need for drugs in order to function and in absence of the drugs, individuals may display withdrawal symptoms. There are two types of dependence, physical and mental. Mental dependence is when the use of a substance leads to a conditioned response to an emotion or feeling. For example, someone suffering from depression might rely heavily on benzodiazepines to evoke positive emotions such as relaxation and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, this could lead to drug misuse and the dependence explanation has helped lead to practical applications to avoid this occurring. For instance, doctors will prescribe benzodiazepines only in serious cases and for less than 4 weeks to avoid dependencyaddiction. This explanation has led to a greater understanding about drugs and positive social changes.<nl><nl>The dependence explanation is limited however, because substance use could also be a result of genetic predispositions. Kendler &amp; Prescott (1998) support this notion through their research on 1,934 twins, ranging in age from 22 to 62. They were given interviews about their drug addictions to cocaine and marijuana. Kendler reported that whilst examining pairs, it was evident that the concordance rates for both twins using drugs was higher in monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ) twins. The concordance rate for cocaine use in MZ twins was 54% and in DZ twins it was 42%. Thus, this gives weight to the influence of genetics on substance use. While it is important to understand the role of heredity on substance use, environmental factors are also as important. These factors may include stress, trauma, or community pressure. Exposure to trauma has been linked closely to substance use. Witnessing death or experiencing assault would be a traumatic experience and these people are more likely to take drugs. This may be because trauma symptoms may become more manageable after self-medicating. Turning to drugs may be the easier escape for some individuals when dealing with environmental difficulties. Thus, substance use may be a result of genetic and environmental factors interacting so therefore, a diathesis stress model should be proposed.<nl><nl>Behaviourists stress the important role operant conditioning has on behaviour. Operant conditioning as proposed by Skinner (1938) can be applied to substance use. For instance, people suffering from trauma may use drugs as a coping mechanism to alleviate their trauma related symptoms (this might include shocks and mood swings). Skinner referred to negative reinforcement as the continual of behaviour to remove any aversive outcomes. Similarly, individuals might repeat the act of taking drugs because it temporarily removes their symptoms. Another concept of operant conditioning is positive reinforcement. This refers to the continual of behaviour to gain a reward. Drugs are involved in the activation of dopamine pathways. These pathways stimulate pleasure and reward thus might also explain why people continue to take drugs. Therefore, the dependent explanation can not alone explain substance use as a variety of factors and explanations might account for it.", "Hi, <nl>my number is <phone_number><new>Hi <addr11_FN>, <nl>I am <part_FN_SN> from your tutorial group, this is my email. <nl><nl>Kind regards, <nl><part_FN><new>Hi Dr <addr3_SN>, <nl>I am <part_FN_SN> (<student_number>), first year <course> student and I wanted to contact you regarding my exam result.

Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001)."]}

These are experiences and sensations which are not comprehensible to others, but to the person experiencing them. Hallucinations include patients hearing, seeing, tasting, touching, and smelling things. An example of hallucinations is the patient may hear voices that may seem angry or urgent and often make demands on them which results in the patient getting injured.<nl><nl>Another positive symptom is delusions, these are beliefs which may conflict with reality. A schizophrenic patient will hold onto those beliefs even though they may be evidence that disproves those false beliefs. An example is paranoid delusions, they may believe people are out to hurt them or the thought people are doing things when there is no evidence that these things are taking place. <nl><nl>Lastly, a positive symptom of schizophrenia is thought disorder. This is a disorganised way of thinking which leads to abnormal ways of expressing language when speaking or writing. An example of a thought disorder is thought blocking.

Erm, she, the girl sitting down, is laughing. And the woman standing up is smiling a little bit, but she\u2019s not looking directly at her. Erm, maybe they\u2019re looking at something together, but that\u2019s not in the picture. The picture is just the girls. The background is just plain white. Erm, there might be some shapes underneath it, I can\u2019t really see. But for the most part it\u2019s either white or blocked out, so the focus of the picture is the girls. Erm, they look like maybe they\u2019re friends or maybe they\u2019re in a study group together, like they could be students. They look about student age. I\u2019d say like early twenties kind of age.

This region of the brain plays a role in memories related to emotion, therefore a smaller hippocampus represents a higher risk for developing PTSD after a traumatic event (Gilbertson 2002). Another biological change that is observed is the failure of the brain centres (e.g ventromedial frontal cortex) which dampens the activation of the brain's fear coordinating centre, the amygdala (Koenigs &amp; Grafman 2009).

{"id": "333a8797-9987-4500-bb4c-33710d4e76b908200", "discourse_types": ["essay", "speech_transcription"], "pair": ["Abstract <nl>The Stroop effect was introduced by John Ridley Stroop in 1935, the task works by examining the response time of the participant to name colors of words presented to them. Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent (CI) than the colour congruent (CC) condition. (M= 966.8, SD= 405.1). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( T= 403, n= 59, p= &lt; .001). Data shows that participants took longer to correctly identify the font colours when they were incongruent with the colour of the words written. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>The results that were found were consistent with previous research of Stroop (1935) and supported the hypothesis as participants did have a slower reaction time when identifying incongruent font colours and had a faster reaction time for the congruent condition. The reaction time was faster for the congruent condition because Cattell (1886) argued that wording reading is automatic therefore it\u2019s quicker for individuals to read the word represented to them in that condition. However, different research finding has been reported from a similar stroop task called emotional stroop (Williams et al. 1996). It was found that the emotional Stroop involves only emotional and neutral words and that color does not affect reaction time because it does not conflict with word meaning. The classic stroop test shows that the reaction time is slower because there is a conflict between an incongruent color and the word. Furthermore,  Salthouse and Meinz (1995) argue that even though age differences specific to stroop interference were minimal, other research may show the relationship between age and Stroop interference was still significant (West &amp; Baylis, 1998). <nl><nl>Finally, some of the methodological issues regarding the experiment were that volunteer sampling was used, only university students participated. Findings cannot be generalised to those who did not volunteer and the finding may not be representative of the whole population. An improvement could be made by selecting people of all ages not just university students. Another issue was that the experiment was not completed in a controlled environment, this means they could have had help from others. Another improvement could be that all the participants complete the test in a psychology lab. Also there may have been extraneous variables which may have affected the results, e.g. some participants may have completed at 9am, they would most likely been tired and have had a slower reaction time. This can be improved by making sure all students complete the test at the same time.", "Erm, so, in the first picture, I can see two young ladies, erm, er, one in stripy black and white top with blonde hair.

{"id": "6d12dfcc-a3bb-4552-9e97-23a20557798c04248", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Aims and Research Questions<nl>The lockdown amidst COVID-19 has made significant disruptions in academic activities. In this lockdown period, it was reported that learners were mostly suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety (42.0%) (Kapasia, N., Paul, P., Roy, A., Saha, J., Zaveri, A., Mallick, R., ... &amp; Chouhan, P. 2020). The negative impact on student mental and physical well-being due to lockdown restrictions, may be seen as detrimental for their academia and overall performance. Other research has been carried out on the wider population, not students specifically, however the COVID-19 lockdown can be seen to affect others negatively, in terms of mental health. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderatesevere insomnia (Gualano, M. R., Lo Moro, G., Voglino, G., Bert, F., &amp; Siliquini, R. 2020). However, research on the wider student experience during COVID-19 in the UK lacks exposure, so the given indication to the gap, conducting this research could be beneficial to raise greater awareness to the subject.<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as the chosen method<nl>IPA is concerned with lived experience. Experience covers quite a lot of territory (Cooper, H. E., Camic, P. M., Long, D. L., Panter, A. T., Rindskopf, D. E., &amp; Sher, K. J. 2012). Furthermore, IPA focuses on the detailed examination of particulars, first providing an in-depth account of each case before moving to look for patterning\u2019s of convergence and divergence across cases (Eatough, V., &amp; Smith, J. A. 2008).  This method allows the researcher to analyse and understand an individual\u2019s experience towards a certain event \u2013 which in this case would be the global pandemic and how it has affected students: it allows us to explore different aspects that may have been impacted and gives us the chance to begin to comprehend those experiences. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>1. \"Feels like a waste of a university experience\"; a student who has been affected by the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>Missing out on experiences and opportunities as a university student, is a main theme in this account - which includes spending time with friends, enjoying the nightlife, parties and academic events (e.g. lectures and seminars). Natasha draws up on the fact that the university experience she is currently having is very different to what she had prior to the COVID-19 restrictions in her first year. Although, she highlights that she had been able to enjoy some of the perks of being a student in her first year of study, she emphasises the lack of it now and realises that she had taken for granted some of the opportunities she had in first year, as she states - \"I definitely should have taken those erm (.) opportunities and just spend it with the people I like being around\". This may highlight the idea that Natasha feels regret because certain experiences are not as readily available as they were before.<nl>1.1 \"I\u2019m not seeing my friends as often as I would do... I\u2019m not going out\": the negatives highlighted due to the lockdown. <nl>Natasha was asked to compare her first year to her current year of university, and the main focus had been that there is a lack of opportunity to go out with friends - to restaurants, clubs and parties: all of which have been impacted significantly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. Further down in the interview she once again emphasises the fact that she yearns for a greater chance to go out to social events: \"I really do miss going out with them and seeing them and spending time with them\". It may suggest that Natasha, who is already limited by the distance from university to her hometown and who may have relied on interaction from social events at university, has been severely impacted and may go on to feel \"lonely\" within these circumstances, as she had previously mentioned when asked who she was able to communicate with at the moment. <nl><nl>There is no doubt that one of the main disadvantages Natasha focuses on is the idea that her personality is hindered by the lockdown: \"there is a lot of downsides...one of the things I love the most like going out, seeing my friends\", she draws attention to this significant piece missing in her life and emphasises how much she enjoys going out and seeing my friends by using the word \"love\". Due to the restrictions there may be an imbalance of work and leisure, Natasha may feel as though she is trapped in unhappiness during this global pandemic. <nl>1.2 \"...I\u2019ve not met anyone new on my course which is a bit upsetting\": the lack of engagement due to face-to-face teaching being moved online. <nl>When Natasha was asked: \"How they get along with engaging with other students\" - the response steered in a direction where she expressed a disappointment in the lack of opportunity to meet new course mates. She stated this a couple of times whilst answering this question: \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\", which may indicate that she has been deeply affected by the fact that the opportunity to engage with other students has been stripped away.<nl>University can be advertised amongst students as being a place where there is a chance to meet many different people - however, the outlook has changed significantly as those opportunities have been limited due to the restrictions; \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\" - Natasha emphasises that university no longer serves the purpose of networking and meeting new people because of social distancing.<nl><nl>2.0 \"...detached mentally from my studies\": recognising the lack of motivation.<nl>Main theme in this segment is how Natasha highlights the depletion of her mental well-being towards her studies and daily life. The lack of face-to-face teaching seems to be the reason for this, as further down the interview she mentions - \"I don\u2019t feel like a uni student (.) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m mentally there so my motivation has decreased signi-significantly\" which further supports the idea that the restrictions are detrimental to university students - due to the vast amount of lectures being moved online. This mentality and decrease of motivation may indicate a severe impact towards Natasha\u2019s mental health and well-being during this period of time. However, this could also be catastrophic for her university grades, as the lack of motivation may hinder the quality of her work and may lead her to underachieve. <nl><nl>2.1 \"...my mind is always in autopilot\": there is a lack of conscious control. <nl>Natasha goes on to use this phrase to describe her consciousness during the days in lockdown. This may emphasise the idea that her time spent in lockdown is constant and uneventful leading her to lose conscious awareness of what she is doing. The use of the word \"autopilot\" underlines the fact that she is aware that she is mentally detached from her life due to the sudden societal changes from the virus. On the other hand, it can be implied that she is comparing herself to that of a machine - where she is constantly stuck in a pattern doing the same thing daily.<nl>She goes on to mention that her \"days kinda merge into one\"- and further explains that she finds it easy to \"lose track\" of what she is doing and what she \"should be doing\",  which may lead to imply that lockdown has had both mental and physical obstacles, that Natasha has encountered and finds it difficult to plan her days and keep to a schedule. The use of the strong verb \"merge\" accentuates the difficulty Natasha is having to distinguish the days as they go by, possibly creating a blurred sense of reality whilst living with the restrictions.<nl><nl>2.2 \"spend the whole day in bed and its really taking a toll on me mentally\": is showing traits of a mental health disorder due to the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>When Natasha was asked how her daily life had changed, she proceeded to emphasise that the gym after the first lockdown, had allowed her to make progress \"mentally and physically\". However, the gyms were forced to close again following the second national lockdown. This proved to be a significant impact for Natasha \u2013 as further down in the answer she stated that she would \"spend the whole day in bed\". This may suggest that she may have been experiencing a mental health related disorder which could have been onset due to the second lockdown. This may portray the risk that the restrictions have towards the well-being of students. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, Natasha has had a wide range of negative changes and experiences whilst being a university student during the global pandemic\u2013 most aspects do relate to the new introduction of social distancing: which has proven to be a big change for her as she thrives of socialising and meeting new people. Natasha who has moved out from their hometown and is now situated in the city where she attends university is likely to feel lonely due to not being around friends or family. The decline in mental health has been evident \u2013 towards both her studies and daily life in general. Natasha finds it hard to live in the present and feels mentally absent on some days. This may indicate that being a student during the global pandemic is detrimental for individuals such as Natasha; leading to unhappiness, loneliness, disappointment, decline in mental health and being unmotivated.

One is standing up and leaning over a little bit. She is wearing a black and white stripey t-shirt and some jeans, and then sat down next to her is another girl in a leather jacket \u2013 not a leather jacket, a denim jacket. Erm, she, the girl sitting down, is laughing. And the woman standing up is smiling a little bit, but she\u2019s not looking directly at her. Erm, maybe they\u2019re looking at something together, but that\u2019s not in the picture. The picture is just the girls. The background is just plain white. Erm, there might be some shapes underneath it, I can\u2019t really see. But for the most part it\u2019s either white or blocked out, so the focus of the picture is the girls. Erm, they look like maybe they\u2019re friends or maybe they\u2019re in a study group together, like they could be students. They look about student age. I\u2019d say like early twenties kind of age. And yeah, that\u2019s the first image. The second picture has got two boys in it, and the fo- the main, at the front of the picture is a laptop, is an Apple MacBook. Erm, and the background is, I think they\u2019re in like a study booth, maybe. Erm, there\u2019s a table at the front, and then the back is like black with green spots on it, different sizes, dots. And then one of the boys is wearing a t-shirt with flowers on it and pink writing, and he\u2019s got an earring in. And the other boy is wearing like a, I think it\u2019s like plaid or flannel, or whatever, a shirt over a white t-shirt. And he is looking at the laptop, and the other boy is looking at him. Again, I think students, in probably a study session. I think they might be in a study group together. They both ar- they seem happy to be there,  <laugh>  I don\u2019t know, kind of not outwardly smiling but a bit of a smile. Erm, seems like they get on, but I don\u2019t know if I would say, they don\u2019t really look like best friends I would say. So maybe they\u2019ve met in a study group, or maybe they\u2019re just acquaintances, I don\u2019t know. And then the third picture is, I guess again might be a study situation, because there\u2019s a boy in it holding a book that looks, it\u2019s quite a thick book, so maybe a textbook. Erm, they, there\u2019s a table at the front, like a glass table, and they\u2019re both sat, there are two people in it, both sat on a bench, I think? Erm, sorry, this one\u2019s a boy and a girl. The boy is holding a textbook and he\u2019s got a coat on, and some, I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s, I don\u2019t know. The girl has got her leather jacket on and some boots, and the background is, erm, is black with white dots making up the circle, and then a bigger circle, bigger circle, etc., etc. Erm, and maybe like I said also in a study session, erm, kind of setting, like students. They\u2019re both looking at someone else who\u2019s not in the picture, although there is a hand, so I guess that\u2019s the person\u2019s hand. And they\u2019re both looking quite at them, not each other. So I guess that person\u2019s speaking and they\u2019re both listening. Again they\u2019re both smiling, so obviously comfortable in the situation. Erm, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know about their relationship. That\u2019s not really clear in the picture, whether they\u2019re friends or just been again put together as part of maybe a project or something. And yeah, is that enough?", "Okay, erm, so, I would normally get up about eight and have a cup of tea. So, usually, I like, I quite like PG Tips tea, erm, with milk, I don\u2019t have sugar in it. Erm, so I have that first. And then a bit later, about an hour later, I might have some cereal. So, at the minute, I\u2019ve got, I think it\u2019s like Crunchy Nut cereal with little bits of chocolate in it as a treat. And then sometimes, I might have toast with butter on it, erm, if I'm hungry, if I'm eating a bit later. And then lunchtime, lunchtime varies a lot. It depends what I\u2019ve had in the morning. So, if I\u2019d had toast in the morning, then I wouldn\u2019t want bread again at lunch.  <mobile_phone_alert>  Is that mine or yours? Sorry. And then, if I have cereal, then I might have bread at lunch so, might be a sandwich, maybe some toast. Erm, if not, some, I quite like salad with like couscous in it and maybe chicken if I\u2019ve got some like defrosted or something. And then for dinner, oh I don\u2019t know, dinner, just a hot dinner. Erm, I think I'm having pasta bake tonight and some garlic bread.  <unintelligible>  carbs, actually, when I say it all in one  <laugh> . I try and have some fruit in the day as well.<new>Erm, I like, like my evening meal, like my tea the best, erm, just because when I'm at home that\u2019s when all my family sit round together. So, we\u2019re all, we\u2019ve always been really strict on dinner time that everyone puts their phones away, everyone sits round the table together, like someone cooks, someone lays the table, someone makes drinks. That\u2019s when we all see each other and sit round and have a chat and catch up on everything. Erm, so, obviously, we\u2019re all busy in the day at the minute.<new>Erm, don\u2019t know, really. Erm, I don\u2019t know  <laugh> , I quite like, erm,  <laugh> , sorry, erm, I\u2019ll just say like home cooked foods, like stuff like if I'm at home and my mum cooks, I quite like that.

It\u2019s, it was so strange, it was a real experience.", "Abstract <nl>The Stroop effect was introduced by John Ridley Stroop in 1935, the task works by examining the response time of the participant to name colors of words presented to them. Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent (CI) than the colour congruent (CC) condition. (M= 966.8, SD= 405.1). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( T= 403, n= 59, p= &lt; .001). Data shows that participants took longer to correctly identify the font colours when they were incongruent with the colour of the words written. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>The results that were found were consistent with previous research of Stroop (1935) and supported the hypothesis as participants did have a slower reaction time when identifying incongruent font colours and had a faster reaction time for the congruent condition. The reaction time was faster for the congruent condition because Cattell (1886) argued that wording reading is automatic therefore it\u2019s quicker for individuals to read the word represented to them in that condition. However, different research finding has been reported from a similar stroop task called emotional stroop (Williams et al. 1996). It was found that the emotional Stroop involves only emotional and neutral words and that color does not affect reaction time because it does not conflict with word meaning. The classic stroop test shows that the reaction time is slower because there is a conflict between an incongruent color and the word. Furthermore,  Salthouse and Meinz (1995) argue that even though age differences specific to stroop interference were minimal, other research may show the relationship between age and Stroop interference was still significant (West &amp; Baylis, 1998). <nl><nl>Finally, some of the methodological issues regarding the experiment were that volunteer sampling was used, only university students participated. Findings cannot be generalised to those who did not volunteer and the finding may not be representative of the whole population. An improvement could be made by selecting people of all ages not just university students. Another issue was that the experiment was not completed in a controlled environment, this means they could have had help from others. Another improvement could be that all the participants complete the test in a psychology lab. Also there may have been extraneous variables which may have affected the results, e.g. some participants may have completed at 9am, they would most likely been tired and have had a slower reaction time. This can be improved by making sure all students complete the test at the same time."]}

Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001)."]}

{"id": "8224ce8f-67e8-475e-80aa-220806601203", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Aims and Research Questions<nl>The lockdown amidst COVID-19 has made significant disruptions in academic activities. In this lockdown period, it was reported that learners were mostly suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety (42.0%) (Kapasia, N., Paul, P., Roy, A., Saha, J., Zaveri, A., Mallick, R., ... &amp; Chouhan, P. 2020). The negative impact on student mental and physical well-being due to lockdown restrictions, may be seen as detrimental for their academia and overall performance. Other research has been carried out on the wider population, not students specifically, however the COVID-19 lockdown can be seen to affect others negatively, in terms of mental health. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderatesevere insomnia (Gualano, M. R., Lo Moro, G., Voglino, G., Bert, F., &amp; Siliquini, R. 2020). However, research on the wider student experience during COVID-19 in the UK lacks exposure, so the given indication to the gap, conducting this research could be beneficial to raise greater awareness to the subject.<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as the chosen method<nl>IPA is concerned with lived experience. Experience covers quite a lot of territory (Cooper, H. E., Camic, P. M., Long, D. L., Panter, A. T., Rindskopf, D. E., &amp; Sher, K. J. 2012). Furthermore, IPA focuses on the detailed examination of particulars, first providing an in-depth account of each case before moving to look for patterning\u2019s of convergence and divergence across cases (Eatough, V., &amp; Smith, J. A. 2008).  This method allows the researcher to analyse and understand an individual\u2019s experience towards a certain event \u2013 which in this case would be the global pandemic and how it has affected students: it allows us to explore different aspects that may have been impacted and gives us the chance to begin to comprehend those experiences. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>1. \"Feels like a waste of a university experience\"; a student who has been affected by the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>Missing out on experiences and opportunities as a university student, is a main theme in this account - which includes spending time with friends, enjoying the nightlife, parties and academic events (e.g. lectures and seminars). Natasha draws up on the fact that the university experience she is currently having is very different to what she had prior to the COVID-19 restrictions in her first year. Although, she highlights that she had been able to enjoy some of the perks of being a student in her first year of study, she emphasises the lack of it now and realises that she had taken for granted some of the opportunities she had in first year, as she states - \"I definitely should have taken those erm (.) opportunities and just spend it with the people I like being around\". This may highlight the idea that Natasha feels regret because certain experiences are not as readily available as they were before.<nl>1.1 \"I\u2019m not seeing my friends as often as I would do... I\u2019m not going out\": the negatives highlighted due to the lockdown. <nl>Natasha was asked to compare her first year to her current year of university, and the main focus had been that there is a lack of opportunity to go out with friends - to restaurants, clubs and parties: all of which have been impacted significantly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. Further down in the interview she once again emphasises the fact that she yearns for a greater chance to go out to social events: \"I really do miss going out with them and seeing them and spending time with them\". It may suggest that Natasha, who is already limited by the distance from university to her hometown and who may have relied on interaction from social events at university, has been severely impacted and may go on to feel \"lonely\" within these circumstances, as she had previously mentioned when asked who she was able to communicate with at the moment. <nl><nl>There is no doubt that one of the main disadvantages Natasha focuses on is the idea that her personality is hindered by the lockdown: \"there is a lot of downsides...one of the things I love the most like going out, seeing my friends\", she draws attention to this significant piece missing in her life and emphasises how much she enjoys going out and seeing my friends by using the word \"love\". Due to the restrictions there may be an imbalance of work and leisure, Natasha may feel as though she is trapped in unhappiness during this global pandemic. <nl>1.2 \"...I\u2019ve not met anyone new on my course which is a bit upsetting\": the lack of engagement due to face-to-face teaching being moved online. <nl>When Natasha was asked: \"How they get along with engaging with other students\" - the response steered in a direction where she expressed a disappointment in the lack of opportunity to meet new course mates. She stated this a couple of times whilst answering this question: \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\", which may indicate that she has been deeply affected by the fact that the opportunity to engage with other students has been stripped away.<nl>University can be advertised amongst students as being a place where there is a chance to meet many different people - however, the outlook has changed significantly as those opportunities have been limited due to the restrictions; \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\" - Natasha emphasises that university no longer serves the purpose of networking and meeting new people because of social distancing.<nl><nl>2.0 \"...detached mentally from my studies\": recognising the lack of motivation.<nl>Main theme in this segment is how Natasha highlights the depletion of her mental well-being towards her studies and daily life. The lack of face-to-face teaching seems to be the reason for this, as further down the interview she mentions - \"I don\u2019t feel like a uni student (.) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m mentally there so my motivation has decreased signi-significantly\" which further supports the idea that the restrictions are detrimental to university students - due to the vast amount of lectures being moved online. This mentality and decrease of motivation may indicate a severe impact towards Natasha\u2019s mental health and well-being during this period of time. However, this could also be catastrophic for her university grades, as the lack of motivation may hinder the quality of her work and may lead her to underachieve. <nl><nl>2.1 \"...my mind is always in autopilot\": there is a lack of conscious control. <nl>Natasha goes on to use this phrase to describe her consciousness during the days in lockdown. This may emphasise the idea that her time spent in lockdown is constant and uneventful leading her to lose conscious awareness of what she is doing. The use of the word \"autopilot\" underlines the fact that she is aware that she is mentally detached from her life due to the sudden societal changes from the virus. On the other hand, it can be implied that she is comparing herself to that of a machine - where she is constantly stuck in a pattern doing the same thing daily.<nl>She goes on to mention that her \"days kinda merge into one\"- and further explains that she finds it easy to \"lose track\" of what she is doing and what she \"should be doing\",  which may lead to imply that lockdown has had both mental and physical obstacles, that Natasha has encountered and finds it difficult to plan her days and keep to a schedule. The use of the strong verb \"merge\" accentuates the difficulty Natasha is having to distinguish the days as they go by, possibly creating a blurred sense of reality whilst living with the restrictions.<nl><nl>2.2 \"spend the whole day in bed and its really taking a toll on me mentally\": is showing traits of a mental health disorder due to the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>When Natasha was asked how her daily life had changed, she proceeded to emphasise that the gym after the first lockdown, had allowed her to make progress \"mentally and physically\". However, the gyms were forced to close again following the second national lockdown. This proved to be a significant impact for Natasha \u2013 as further down in the answer she stated that she would \"spend the whole day in bed\". This may suggest that she may have been experiencing a mental health related disorder which could have been onset due to the second lockdown. This may portray the risk that the restrictions have towards the well-being of students. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, Natasha has had a wide range of negative changes and experiences whilst being a university student during the global pandemic\u2013 most aspects do relate to the new introduction of social distancing: which has proven to be a big change for her as she thrives of socialising and meeting new people. Natasha who has moved out from their hometown and is now situated in the city where she attends university is likely to feel lonely due to not being around friends or family. The decline in mental health has been evident \u2013 towards both her studies and daily life in general. Natasha finds it hard to live in the present and feels mentally absent on some days. This may indicate that being a student during the global pandemic is detrimental for individuals such as Natasha; leading to unhappiness, loneliness, disappointment, decline in mental health and being unmotivated.

It is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued left than when cued right. Data from 38 participants was used. Within-subjects design. Independent variable had two levels: cue left, cue right. Dependant variable was the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V). EEG electrodes were attached to relevant areas using the 1020 system. The results showed that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions. The results are consistent with the hypothesis and previous research.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>The alpha inhibition hypothesis refers to the concept that high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha wave in the relaxation state has higher power spectrum than in the attention state. Yaomanee, K., Pan-ngum, S., &amp; Ayuthaya, P. I. N. (2012). Concluding that alpha activity can be modulated by attention, thus meaning that alpha activity is reduced when we pay attention to stimuli.<nl>This experiment is a partial replication of Sauseng et al., (2005). Overall, 22 participants used, and they were given a cued visual attention task. Cued with a fixation cross for 34ms, then an arrow cue would indicate which hemifield a target would appear in. There was a 50% chance of being cued left or right, 75% of the trials were valid and 25% of trials were invalid. Results indicated that parietal regions showed stronger alpha lower band frequency suppression contralateral to the attended hemifield. Similar results for upper frequencies. Therefore, the alpha inhibition hypothesis is supported by these findings as there is stronger alpha activity in the task irrelevant brain areas. <nl>To further support these findings, Mazahari et al., (2014) used 57 adolescent participants: 23 normally developing, 17 who have combined subtype ADHD (inattention and hyperactivity) and 17 who have predominantly inattentive ADHD. Used a cued flanker task. Response preparation cue predicted 84% accuracy, or a null cue was shown which had no information about correct response. Overall participants showed alpha suppression following response preparation cues, greater for normally developing participants and least for inattentive ADHD subtypes. The indicative alpha suppression supports the idea that alpha activity can be modulated by attention \u2013 thus being reduced when participants attended to the stimuli.<nl>Following on previous studies, it is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued to expect a stimulus on the left than when cued to expect a stimulus on the right, when recording from the left parietal lobe (P3).  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>To begin with, 39 undergraduate participants were obtained by volunteer sample, however, one participant was removed as they were only available for one of the two conditions: 38 participants overall. <nl>Design <nl>Within subject\u2019s design, with an independent variable of cue direction with two levels: either left or right. The dependent variable is the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V).<nl><nl>Materials <nl>A Biopac MP36 was used to record alpha range activity and receive event markers for cue left and cue right conditions. EEG electrodes which were attached to the head. AC Cream and Everi cream was used, in preparation prior to the attachment of electrodes. The software PsychoPy was used to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. Stimuli were used to present to the visual fields such as: arrow cues left (&lt;) and right (&gt;), large bar (Figure A) and small bar (Figure B) stimuli. <nl><figure><nl> <nl>Procedure <nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz. Digital channels were set up to receive the event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker. A calculation channel was also set up to record the activity in the alpha frequency range of (8 - 13 Hz). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. <nl>Before preparing the participants, they gave informed consent and were briefed on their right to withdraw from the experiment. To prepare the participants for electrode placement, Everi cream was used to abrase the areas P3, Fz and forehead, selected using the 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Techologies, 2012). The AC cream was then applied on the electrodes: an active electrode was attached to P3. Reference electrodes are attached at Fz. Earth electrodes were attached to the forehead, near the hairline. The impedance levels were checked to be below 10Kohms.  <nl>Participants were given instructions and a practice trial first and were cued with an arrow for 35ms to let participants know which side to expect a stimulus, with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) set to 600ms-800ms in the practice trial. Different event markers were sent at stimulus onset for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli consisted of either large or small white bars shown either left or right on the screen on a black background for 50ms. The participants respond with either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. They underwent 12 practice trials including feedback about their response, before undergoing 4 blocks of 20 trials. After the practice trail was complete, the participants were given feedback on their performance.<nl>The participants were shortly warned that the real experiment was about to start. The random ISI was set to 200ms-1200ms<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>To covert the raw 9-13 Hz Alpha EEG to averaged data. Event markers from PsychoPy were sent to identify when stimuli were presented. Then looked at the period 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown. The data was rectified, which turns the negative values into positive, in order to show alpha activity regardless of it being excitatory or inhibitory. Averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of the outlying or extreme values. The rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were then suitable for statistical analysis. <nl>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics<nl>Firstly, to determine whether the data is parametric, a Shapiro-Wilk test was used and p&lt;.005. The p value is less than .05, therefore, a non-parametric equivalent had to be used: <nl>Wilcoxon signed ranks test. <nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions and a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed this difference was significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were consistent with the predicted hypothesis, as the median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left, than cue right and this supports the idea that alpha activity at P3 is different depending on which side participants are cued to expect a stimulus. <nl>The results also support previous research and the alpha inhibition hypothesis, as high alpha shows the inhibition of task irrelevant areas due to more activity in the left hemisphere (Klimesch et al., 2007), on the ipsilateral side of where the cue was presented. <nl>Although the results are consistent with the hypothesis, confounding variables may have altered the data to an extent. The participants moving around, may have altered the validity as gross motor movements may contaminate the EEG recordings, (Bell, M. A., &amp; Cuevas, K., 2012).<nl>Overall, there may be some areas for improvement to prevent confounding variables from affecting the data. To prevent motor movements, the participants should be given strict instructions to follow due to the sensitivity of the EEG. The researchers should monitor the participants to check if those instructions are being followed. However, despite these issues, the results can be granted as valid as the correct procedures were taken during the experiment, such as ensuring the impedance levels were below 10Kohms and in addition the results were expected due to previous research.", "Hi <addr2_FN>, <nl><nl> <nl><nl>Thank you for getting back to me.

This might include an increase in negative emotions and the inability to experience positive ones. For instance, if a woman was sexually abused, she might experience anxiety or fear even after her abuse. A second cognitive change might be a severe lack of interest in activities. The women might have enjoyed spending time with her friends prior to her abuse but after the abuse she might resist and avoid any involvement in activities that were once pleasurable to her. She may also blame herself for getting sexually abused. Her choice of wearing a scandalous outfit might justify why someone abused her and this would be another cognitive change.<nl><nl>There are also biological changes associated with PTSD. The amygdala is responsible for the perception of emotions and the ventromedial frontal cortex is responsible for regulating responses to emotions. However, the frontal region with those who have PTSD does not function effectively and it does not dampen down the amygdala to the same degree as it does with people without the disorder. Another biological change may be a decrease in the size of the hippocampus, and this might explain why people with PTSD have difficulties consolidating their memories.<nl><nl><nl>Question 2: Outline the proposed role of operant conditioning in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).  How would a behavioural therapist treat OCD? (Both parts of this question are equally weighted). <nl><nl>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is made up of two components, obsessions and compulsions. The compulsion refers to the repetitive behaviour, for example, suffers may regularly wash their hands to reduce anxiety. The anxiety is caused by obsessive, irrational thoughts for example, the constant fear of germs and bacteria. According to the second stage of Mowrer\u2019s (1947) two stage theory, the removal of an aversive stimulus will negatively reinforce behaviour. In other words, the removal of anxiety is caused by the compulsive acts of washing hands \u2013 negative reinforcement and the relief from the anxiety might be rewarding to a sufferer \u2013 positive reinforcement. Thus, the behaviour will perpetuate because it is both negatively and positively reinforced.<nl><nl>Behavioural therapists treat OCD using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT involves the therapist and sufferer to actively break down and challenge irrational thoughts and behaviours through exposure and response prevention (ERP). This involves the gradual exposure to the feared object, this might be a fear of dirt and individuals are counter conditioned to learn new ways to control their compulsive behaviours around the fear. Once the fear is mastered, they will adopt these changes into their daily routine and try overcome their disorder.<nl><nl>Section B<nl>Critically evaluate the concept of dependence as an explanation for substance use.<nl>Dependence is an explanation for substance use and it refers to the need for drugs in order to function and in absence of the drugs, individuals may display withdrawal symptoms. There are two types of dependence, physical and mental. Mental dependence is when the use of a substance leads to a conditioned response to an emotion or feeling. For example, someone suffering from depression might rely heavily on benzodiazepines to evoke positive emotions such as relaxation and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, this could lead to drug misuse and the dependence explanation has helped lead to practical applications to avoid this occurring. For instance, doctors will prescribe benzodiazepines only in serious cases and for less than 4 weeks to avoid dependencyaddiction. This explanation has led to a greater understanding about drugs and positive social changes.<nl><nl>The dependence explanation is limited however, because substance use could also be a result of genetic predispositions. Kendler &amp; Prescott (1998) support this notion through their research on 1,934 twins, ranging in age from 22 to 62. They were given interviews about their drug addictions to cocaine and marijuana. Kendler reported that whilst examining pairs, it was evident that the concordance rates for both twins using drugs was higher in monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ) twins. The concordance rate for cocaine use in MZ twins was 54% and in DZ twins it was 42%. Thus, this gives weight to the influence of genetics on substance use. While it is important to understand the role of heredity on substance use, environmental factors are also as important. These factors may include stress, trauma, or community pressure. Exposure to trauma has been linked closely to substance use. Witnessing death or experiencing assault would be a traumatic experience and these people are more likely to take drugs. This may be because trauma symptoms may become more manageable after self-medicating. Turning to drugs may be the easier escape for some individuals when dealing with environmental difficulties. Thus, substance use may be a result of genetic and environmental factors interacting so therefore, a diathesis stress model should be proposed.<nl><nl>Behaviourists stress the important role operant conditioning has on behaviour. Operant conditioning as proposed by Skinner (1938) can be applied to substance use. For instance, people suffering from trauma may use drugs as a coping mechanism to alleviate their trauma related symptoms (this might include shocks and mood swings). Skinner referred to negative reinforcement as the continual of behaviour to remove any aversive outcomes. Similarly, individuals might repeat the act of taking drugs because it temporarily removes their symptoms. Another concept of operant conditioning is positive reinforcement. This refers to the continual of behaviour to gain a reward. Drugs are involved in the activation of dopamine pathways. These pathways stimulate pleasure and reward thus might also explain why people continue to take drugs. Therefore, the dependent explanation can not alone explain substance use as a variety of factors and explanations might account for it.", " Yeah.

{"id": "5a7d986d-19c2-4a78-a7cb-992768329a5f07308", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>This paper will examine whether there is a difference in how males and females use language when in the role of competition judge, and whether the formality of the situation has an impact. This study will focus on the politeness strategies used by each gender when critiquing the contestants. To achieve this, it will investigate the number of lines of speech, the use of positive as opposed to negative adjectives and the use of hedges or intensifiers. A hedge is a linguistic device used to mitigate a statement by lowering epistemic modality and directness with the goal of reducing the threat to face (Salager-Meyer, 1994; Brown and Levinson, 1978.) On the other hand, an intensifier is an adverb or adverbial phrase used to give emphasis (Bolinger, 1972). <nl>The data used in this study is from The Great British Bake Off (which will from here onwards be referred to as GBBO) and MasterChef: The Professionals, which will simply be referred to as MasterChef. These two programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions, but MasterChef features professional chefs and GBBO amateur bakers. There is also a difference in formality as GBBO is more informal and light-hearted which is shown by its two presenters both being comedians. On the other hand, MasterChef is more formal in tone and takes a more serious approach. <nl>This topic has been chosen as it combines politeness theories with gender theory in order to examine how they interact with each other, applying this to a competition environment. Both of the datasets are from television shows therefore it is important to take into account that they may be edited to portray people in a certain way or to best fulfil the main purpose of the shows, which is to entertain. It will be interesting to see how this artificial environment impacts the judges as they may be inclined to be more polite than usual in order to portray themselves well on television, or less polite if their career is based on them playing a \"villain\" role.<nl><nl>Research Background <nl>There has been much debate by linguistics over the relationship between gender and language and the effect the former has on the latter. One of the seminal theorists in this subject is Robin Lakoff (1975) who suggested that there are fundamental differences in how men and women use language. Most relevant to this paper was her identified differences in the use of polite forms, with women typically using more polite forms than men. Janet Holmes (2013) also agreed that women are more likely to use polite forms, although acknowledged that there are differences depending on factors such as the context of the interaction and the specific people involved. She argued that: <nl>\"when all the necessary reservations and qualifications have been taken into account, I think the answer is \u2018yes, women are more polite than men\u2019\" (Holmes, 1995: 5). <nl>It has also been suggested that women use more polite forms as they are more powerless than men (Deuchar, 1988). One theory that supports this is the dominance theory which investigated the number of interruptions between men and women in a mixed gender conversation (Zimmerman and West, 1975). The study found that men are much more likely to interrupt than women and across the eleven conversations they recorded women interrupted only twice whereas men interrupted 46 times. This supports the idea that women are more polite than men, however the study only has a small sample size of 35 participants, all of whom were from a similar background, and is over 45 years old. <nl>Looking more closely at politeness, it can be defined as a type of communication that shows respect and gives some benefit to the other communicators (Leech, 2014). It is an act which aims to maintain the other participants\u2019 positive and negative face (Goffman, 1967). <nl>Leech\u2019s politeness principle (1983) argues that speakers must follow six maxims in order to be considered polite. The theory builds on Grice\u2019s maxims of conversation (1975) but expands these maxim\u2019s and focuses them specifically on appearing polite. These maxims of politeness are; tact, generosity, approbation, modesty and agreement. This study will focus on the maxim of approbation, which involves maximising expressions of praise and approval and lessening the expressions of dispraise. <nl>In a recent study, these maxims were applied to high school students and their interactions with teachers in order to investigate how gender influences politeness (Ningsih et al., 2020). The study used a qualitive approach and gathered data through observations and recordings. They found that both male and female students adhered to the politeness principle more strongly with female teachers than with male teachers. This could suggest that how polite a speaker is depends on the gender of the person they are speaking to more than their own gender identification. Although this study looks only at the speaker and does not take into account the gender of the addressee, this could account for some of the patterns of politeness encountered and therefore is worth taking into consideration. <nl>Looking at this previous research, it could be expected that the female judges in this study will show more behaviours associated with politeness than the male judges, which will be shown through an increase of positive adjectives and a decrease of negative adjectives. It is also expected that the female judges will more often seek to minimise the amount of dispraise given and use hedges to save the hearer\u2019s positive face, whilst using more intensifiers to emphasise praise. It is also anticipated that males will dominate the conversation more, which could be seen as impolite as they allow less room in the conversation for the female judges to speak.<nl><nl>Methodology <nl>The data used in this investigation is from the final episode of the 2020 series of GBBO and the 2020 final of MasterChef. In each episode there are three contestants remaining and so, by using the first challenge they are given in each, there are three sets of comparable data for each show. Each judgement was then transcribed using the key in appendix one. The narration in MasterChef was excluded from the transcripts as it was edited in later and therefore was not part of the conversation being analysed. This analysis only focused on the judge\u2019s communication; however, the contestants and presenter\u2019s speech were included in the transcriptions for context. <nl>These programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions and so the type of praisecriticism given is comparable. However, the difference in tone and level of formality between the programmes allows a deeper investigation into the impact of context on politeness. It will be of interest to see whether the hypothesises are realised and whether the tone and formality of each programme impacts this, and if so to what extent. These programmes were also chosen as they have mixed gender judging panels thus the impact of gender can be observed. <nl>Once the data had been collected, it was analysed using a quantitative approach. The number of lines of speech by each of the judges was counted in each extract and placed into table one. In MasterChef there were three judges, two of which were male. In order to calculate the number of lines of speech for the males, the number for each judge was added together and then divided by two. Although this removes the influence of the individual, which is a disadvantage, it allows the proportion of speech by each gender to be directly compared, which for the purposes of this investigation was deemed more important. <nl>When counting the lines of speech, each line was counted as a whole regardless of the length. However, there is one result which contains a half due to the calculation used to find the average. Speech was also counted as one line if it was transcribed across two due to interruption but the utterance carried on unbroken. <nl>The use of adjectives was also counted and placed into a table (table two) and the context of the utterance was used to determine whether an adjective was used positively as praise, or negatively to criticise. The same method was then applied to the use of hedges and intensifiers, which were then discussed in a qualitative light to determine the effect they had on the overall politeness of each statement.<nl><nl>Findings <nl>i. Amount of speech by male and female judges <nl>The following table summarises the number of lines of speech made by male and female judges in each dataset. As there were two male judges in MasterChef the average number of lines of speech made between them has been used, as mentioned in the methodology. <nl><table><nl>Looking at GBBO first, on average the male judge (Paul) utters more lines of speech than the female judge (Prue). In the judgements of contestants one and three, Paul utters eight lines of speech as opposed to Prue\u2019s six lines, an increase of 28.57%. This is befitting the hypothesis that the male judge will speak more than the female judge, however the data featuring contestant two conflicts with this. In this instance, Prue has one more line of speech than Paul which is a 22.22% difference. Overall, Paul speaks more than Prue in two of the three extracts, and in there is a greater difference between the judges when Paul is the one speaking more. Across all three extracts Paul is shown to utter 16.22% more lines of speech than Prue, conforming to the expected results. <nl>Analysing the MasterChef results, the males (Gregg and Marcus) utter more lines of speech in the judgements of contestants one and two than the female judge (Monica). In the transcript featuring contestant one there is a 40% difference in the number of utterances, and in the next there is a 22.22% difference. This is a greater increase in the amount of speech by males as opposed to females than was seen in GBBO. Yet, when the judgement of contestant three is analysed, the largest difference in speech of all the transcripts is shown with Monica speaking 66.67% more lines than the male judges. This means that overall, there is only a 3.39% difference between the male and female judges, with the female judge having uttered more lines in total. This disagrees with the hypothesis that men would talk more but the difference in utterance of lines is minimal. <nl>To conclude, the data from GBBO is in accordance with the hypothesis made that males will utter more lines of speech than females, but the data from MasterChef contradicts it. There are a few possible explanations for why this might have occurred. One explanation is the difference in tone between the two shows; In MasterChef the setting is more formal and professional whereas GBBO is a more informal setting where the judges interact with the contestants more colloquially. Therefore, GBBO mirrors normal conversations more than MasterChef and the context relates more closely to that of the studies researched for this paper. There is also a difference in the way the programmes are formatted. The judgement in GBBO is more like a conversation in the first challenge, so there are examples of turn-taking within the conversation. In contrast, on MasterChef the judges speak one at a time in longer instances and there are no conversations between them. This could influence the results as it means the participants are not dominating the conversation but rather giving a longer individual monologue. <nl>It is also of note that the extracts transcribed are only a couple of minutes long and therefore there is only a relatively small amount of data. In a longer conversation there is a possibility that the difference between male and female speech could become more defined.<nl><nl>ii. Use of adjectives <nl>When categorising the use of adjectives into positive or negative classifications, the context of the sentence was used to determine what category was most appropriate. They were then collated into the table below. <nl><table><nl>For example, \"wobbly\" was classed as a positive adjective as it was used in the utterance \"I like the wobbly lines\" (Appendix three, lines 20-22). <nl>Analysing the use of adjectives by the GBBO judges, Prue used more positive adjectives with each contestant as well as a greater range of adjectives. Looking at the use of negative adjectives, both judges used a similar number however Paul used one more. Therefore, the GBBO data aligns with the hypothesis that the female judge would use more adjectives that signal praise, and the male more negative adjectives. <nl>When comparing this to the results for the MasterChef data, Monica used an equal number of negative adjectives as Marcus, and one more than Gregg who did not use any. This contradicts the hypothesis and suggests that Monica is more willing to risk threatening the contestants face than Gregg, who only uses compliments. When judging the first contestant, Gregg used seven times as many adjectives to give praise than Monica did, and more than twice as many as Marcus. With the next contestant all three judges used the same number of positive adjectives and with the final contestant Monica used the most; using four times as many as Gregg and twice as many as Marcus. Ranking the judges based on their use of positive minus negative adjectives, Marcus and Monica both ranked the same and Gregg ranked highest meaning he is most concerned with politeness and least willing to flout the maxim of approbation. In summary, the data from MasterChef does not support the hypothesis and contrasts with the GBBO results. <nl><nl>iii. Use of hedges and intensifiers <nl>Within this table a colour-coding system has been using to differentiate between the hedges and intensifiers that have been used in relation to negative statements, and those that have been used positively. Text in green represents the words and phrases that have be used in relation to praise, and red has been used for text that relates to dispraise or criticism. <nl><table><nl>The intensifier \"very very\" was kept as one phrase within the table rather than two instances of the word \"very\" to emphasise how strongly the praise was given. <nl>The results from the analysis on hedging and intensifiers is similar to the patterns seen when investigating the use of adjectives. In the GBBO data, Prue used more positively associated hedges and intensifiers and fewer negative ones than Paul. <nl>Similarly, in the MasterChef data Gregg did not use any negative forms of these linguistic features which correlates with his use of adjectives. Although Marcus used more negative forms of the features than Monica, he also used more positive forms therefore showing they have an equal level of politeness as shown with their use of adjectives. <nl>Overall, this section again confirms that the judges in GBBO conform to the ideas of gender and politeness, whereas the judges in MasterChef do not. This could be down to the individual\u2019s character, as the social constructivist theory suggests that gender is only one part of our identity that influences communication; Personality, status, level of education and ethnicity also all serve to shape our communication (Burr, 2015). It suggests that people make each element of this construction relevant or irrelevant as is necessary. This suggests that Monica and Gregg could be choosing not to make their gender relevant to their role as judge, and each is relying on other factors to influence their use of praise instead. <nl><nl>Discussion <nl>One section that is particularly interesting is where Paul and Prue discussed the issues with Dave\u2019s custard slice in the GGBO. In the extract below, both judges use a mixture of hedges and praise to try and soften their criticism of Dave and minimise their flouting of the maxim of approbation. <nl><data_extract><nl>In cooking the adjective \"strong\" can be both positive or negative. In this extract Prue signals that she is using it positively by her use of the phrase \"I love the coffee\" before describing it as strong, thereby using it to praise Dave. The use of the intensifier \"really\" emphasises the strength of the flavour which adds to this praise. This extract also features the word \"stodgy\" three times. In the first instance, Paul used it to criticise Dave\u2019s custard which is an example of a positive face threatening act. However, Paul lessens the impact of the criticism by using the hedging phrase \"a little bit\" therefore minimising the expression of dispraise as laid out in Leech\u2019s maxim of approbation (1983). Prue then repeats this criticism however she uses the adjective \"stodgy\" twice with an emphasis on the first time. In this instance she is using the first expression of stodgy as a hedge to minimise the impact of the second expression, hereby implying it is not as bad as it could be and is only minorly stodgy. Again, this helps to minimise the impoliteness and helps to save face. \"Pretty\" is also used as a hedge in this extract, which lessens the compliment of it being \"delicious\". The use of the adverb \"still\" serves to further lessen it, so although Prue is paying a compliment, she is still acknowledging that the baking has flaws. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, the hypothesises that female judges would use more language concerned with politeness were realised to a certain extent. The patterns of communication shown by the GBBO judges did match up with what was expected, however the judges in MasterChef conformed to these expectations to a much lesser extent. This could be due to the formality of the show as opposed to the more colloquial nature of The Great British Bake Off, although it could also be due to the individual backgrounds and personalities of each judge. There is also a possibility that the gender of the contestant being judged has an impact on how the judges use politeness. Future research could investigate further by looking at a greater range of programmes and including more data for each. There is also an age difference of 35 years between the two female judges so it could be interesting to investigate deeper into how the changes in society between these years have influenced how women use language in reference to politeness.", "Mm, I quite like making a lasagne, just \u2018cause of all the different parts of it and it\u2019s quite well done to make all of it from scratch.

It is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued left than when cued right. Data from 38 participants was used. Within-subjects design. Independent variable had two levels: cue left, cue right. Dependant variable was the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V). EEG electrodes were attached to relevant areas using the 1020 system. The results showed that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions. The results are consistent with the hypothesis and previous research.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>The alpha inhibition hypothesis refers to the concept that high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha wave in the relaxation state has higher power spectrum than in the attention state. Yaomanee, K., Pan-ngum, S., &amp; Ayuthaya, P. I. N. (2012). Concluding that alpha activity can be modulated by attention, thus meaning that alpha activity is reduced when we pay attention to stimuli.<nl>This experiment is a partial replication of Sauseng et al., (2005). Overall, 22 participants used, and they were given a cued visual attention task. Cued with a fixation cross for 34ms, then an arrow cue would indicate which hemifield a target would appear in. There was a 50% chance of being cued left or right, 75% of the trials were valid and 25% of trials were invalid. Results indicated that parietal regions showed stronger alpha lower band frequency suppression contralateral to the attended hemifield. Similar results for upper frequencies. Therefore, the alpha inhibition hypothesis is supported by these findings as there is stronger alpha activity in the task irrelevant brain areas. <nl>To further support these findings, Mazahari et al., (2014) used 57 adolescent participants: 23 normally developing, 17 who have combined subtype ADHD (inattention and hyperactivity) and 17 who have predominantly inattentive ADHD. Used a cued flanker task. Response preparation cue predicted 84% accuracy, or a null cue was shown which had no information about correct response. Overall participants showed alpha suppression following response preparation cues, greater for normally developing participants and least for inattentive ADHD subtypes. The indicative alpha suppression supports the idea that alpha activity can be modulated by attention \u2013 thus being reduced when participants attended to the stimuli.<nl>Following on previous studies, it is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued to expect a stimulus on the left than when cued to expect a stimulus on the right, when recording from the left parietal lobe (P3).  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>To begin with, 39 undergraduate participants were obtained by volunteer sample, however, one participant was removed as they were only available for one of the two conditions: 38 participants overall. <nl>Design <nl>Within subject\u2019s design, with an independent variable of cue direction with two levels: either left or right. The dependent variable is the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V).<nl><nl>Materials <nl>A Biopac MP36 was used to record alpha range activity and receive event markers for cue left and cue right conditions. EEG electrodes which were attached to the head. AC Cream and Everi cream was used, in preparation prior to the attachment of electrodes. The software PsychoPy was used to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. Stimuli were used to present to the visual fields such as: arrow cues left (&lt;) and right (&gt;), large bar (Figure A) and small bar (Figure B) stimuli. <nl><figure><nl> <nl>Procedure <nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz. Digital channels were set up to receive the event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker. A calculation channel was also set up to record the activity in the alpha frequency range of (8 - 13 Hz). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. <nl>Before preparing the participants, they gave informed consent and were briefed on their right to withdraw from the experiment. To prepare the participants for electrode placement, Everi cream was used to abrase the areas P3, Fz and forehead, selected using the 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Techologies, 2012). The AC cream was then applied on the electrodes: an active electrode was attached to P3. Reference electrodes are attached at Fz. Earth electrodes were attached to the forehead, near the hairline. The impedance levels were checked to be below 10Kohms.  <nl>Participants were given instructions and a practice trial first and were cued with an arrow for 35ms to let participants know which side to expect a stimulus, with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) set to 600ms-800ms in the practice trial. Different event markers were sent at stimulus onset for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli consisted of either large or small white bars shown either left or right on the screen on a black background for 50ms. The participants respond with either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. They underwent 12 practice trials including feedback about their response, before undergoing 4 blocks of 20 trials. After the practice trail was complete, the participants were given feedback on their performance.<nl>The participants were shortly warned that the real experiment was about to start. The random ISI was set to 200ms-1200ms<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>To covert the raw 9-13 Hz Alpha EEG to averaged data. Event markers from PsychoPy were sent to identify when stimuli were presented. Then looked at the period 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown. The data was rectified, which turns the negative values into positive, in order to show alpha activity regardless of it being excitatory or inhibitory. Averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of the outlying or extreme values. The rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were then suitable for statistical analysis. <nl>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics<nl>Firstly, to determine whether the data is parametric, a Shapiro-Wilk test was used and p&lt;.005. The p value is less than .05, therefore, a non-parametric equivalent had to be used: <nl>Wilcoxon signed ranks test. <nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions and a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed this difference was significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were consistent with the predicted hypothesis, as the median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left, than cue right and this supports the idea that alpha activity at P3 is different depending on which side participants are cued to expect a stimulus. <nl>The results also support previous research and the alpha inhibition hypothesis, as high alpha shows the inhibition of task irrelevant areas due to more activity in the left hemisphere (Klimesch et al., 2007), on the ipsilateral side of where the cue was presented. <nl>Although the results are consistent with the hypothesis, confounding variables may have altered the data to an extent. The participants moving around, may have altered the validity as gross motor movements may contaminate the EEG recordings, (Bell, M. A., &amp; Cuevas, K., 2012).<nl>Overall, there may be some areas for improvement to prevent confounding variables from affecting the data. To prevent motor movements, the participants should be given strict instructions to follow due to the sensitivity of the EEG. The researchers should monitor the participants to check if those instructions are being followed. However, despite these issues, the results can be granted as valid as the correct procedures were taken during the experiment, such as ensuring the impedance levels were below 10Kohms and in addition the results were expected due to previous research.", "Hi, <nl>my number is <phone_number><new>Hi <addr11_FN>, <nl>I am <part_FN_SN> from your tutorial group, this is my email. <nl><nl>Kind regards, <nl><part_FN><new>Hi Dr <addr3_SN>, <nl>I am <part_FN_SN> (<student_number>), first year <course> student and I wanted to contact you regarding my exam result.

{"id": "79d854cd-11fb-434d-b415-6aac0cf4f3a704424", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Aims and Research Questions<nl>The lockdown amidst COVID-19 has made significant disruptions in academic activities. In this lockdown period, it was reported that learners were mostly suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety (42.0%) (Kapasia, N., Paul, P., Roy, A., Saha, J., Zaveri, A., Mallick, R., ... &amp; Chouhan, P. 2020). The negative impact on student mental and physical well-being due to lockdown restrictions, may be seen as detrimental for their academia and overall performance. Other research has been carried out on the wider population, not students specifically, however the COVID-19 lockdown can be seen to affect others negatively, in terms of mental health. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderatesevere insomnia (Gualano, M. R., Lo Moro, G., Voglino, G., Bert, F., &amp; Siliquini, R. 2020). However, research on the wider student experience during COVID-19 in the UK lacks exposure, so the given indication to the gap, conducting this research could be beneficial to raise greater awareness to the subject.<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as the chosen method<nl>IPA is concerned with lived experience. Experience covers quite a lot of territory (Cooper, H. E., Camic, P. M., Long, D. L., Panter, A. T., Rindskopf, D. E., &amp; Sher, K. J. 2012). Furthermore, IPA focuses on the detailed examination of particulars, first providing an in-depth account of each case before moving to look for patterning\u2019s of convergence and divergence across cases (Eatough, V., &amp; Smith, J. A. 2008).  This method allows the researcher to analyse and understand an individual\u2019s experience towards a certain event \u2013 which in this case would be the global pandemic and how it has affected students: it allows us to explore different aspects that may have been impacted and gives us the chance to begin to comprehend those experiences. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>1. \"Feels like a waste of a university experience\"; a student who has been affected by the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>Missing out on experiences and opportunities as a university student, is a main theme in this account - which includes spending time with friends, enjoying the nightlife, parties and academic events (e.g. lectures and seminars). Natasha draws up on the fact that the university experience she is currently having is very different to what she had prior to the COVID-19 restrictions in her first year. Although, she highlights that she had been able to enjoy some of the perks of being a student in her first year of study, she emphasises the lack of it now and realises that she had taken for granted some of the opportunities she had in first year, as she states - \"I definitely should have taken those erm (.) opportunities and just spend it with the people I like being around\". This may highlight the idea that Natasha feels regret because certain experiences are not as readily available as they were before.<nl>1.1 \"I\u2019m not seeing my friends as often as I would do... I\u2019m not going out\": the negatives highlighted due to the lockdown. <nl>Natasha was asked to compare her first year to her current year of university, and the main focus had been that there is a lack of opportunity to go out with friends - to restaurants, clubs and parties: all of which have been impacted significantly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. Further down in the interview she once again emphasises the fact that she yearns for a greater chance to go out to social events: \"I really do miss going out with them and seeing them and spending time with them\". It may suggest that Natasha, who is already limited by the distance from university to her hometown and who may have relied on interaction from social events at university, has been severely impacted and may go on to feel \"lonely\" within these circumstances, as she had previously mentioned when asked who she was able to communicate with at the moment. <nl><nl>There is no doubt that one of the main disadvantages Natasha focuses on is the idea that her personality is hindered by the lockdown: \"there is a lot of downsides...one of the things I love the most like going out, seeing my friends\", she draws attention to this significant piece missing in her life and emphasises how much she enjoys going out and seeing my friends by using the word \"love\". Due to the restrictions there may be an imbalance of work and leisure, Natasha may feel as though she is trapped in unhappiness during this global pandemic. <nl>1.2 \"...I\u2019ve not met anyone new on my course which is a bit upsetting\": the lack of engagement due to face-to-face teaching being moved online. <nl>When Natasha was asked: \"How they get along with engaging with other students\" - the response steered in a direction where she expressed a disappointment in the lack of opportunity to meet new course mates. She stated this a couple of times whilst answering this question: \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\", which may indicate that she has been deeply affected by the fact that the opportunity to engage with other students has been stripped away.<nl>University can be advertised amongst students as being a place where there is a chance to meet many different people - however, the outlook has changed significantly as those opportunities have been limited due to the restrictions; \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\" - Natasha emphasises that university no longer serves the purpose of networking and meeting new people because of social distancing.<nl><nl>2.0 \"...detached mentally from my studies\": recognising the lack of motivation.<nl>Main theme in this segment is how Natasha highlights the depletion of her mental well-being towards her studies and daily life. The lack of face-to-face teaching seems to be the reason for this, as further down the interview she mentions - \"I don\u2019t feel like a uni student (.) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m mentally there so my motivation has decreased signi-significantly\" which further supports the idea that the restrictions are detrimental to university students - due to the vast amount of lectures being moved online. This mentality and decrease of motivation may indicate a severe impact towards Natasha\u2019s mental health and well-being during this period of time. However, this could also be catastrophic for her university grades, as the lack of motivation may hinder the quality of her work and may lead her to underachieve. <nl><nl>2.1 \"...my mind is always in autopilot\": there is a lack of conscious control. <nl>Natasha goes on to use this phrase to describe her consciousness during the days in lockdown. This may emphasise the idea that her time spent in lockdown is constant and uneventful leading her to lose conscious awareness of what she is doing. The use of the word \"autopilot\" underlines the fact that she is aware that she is mentally detached from her life due to the sudden societal changes from the virus. On the other hand, it can be implied that she is comparing herself to that of a machine - where she is constantly stuck in a pattern doing the same thing daily.<nl>She goes on to mention that her \"days kinda merge into one\"- and further explains that she finds it easy to \"lose track\" of what she is doing and what she \"should be doing\",  which may lead to imply that lockdown has had both mental and physical obstacles, that Natasha has encountered and finds it difficult to plan her days and keep to a schedule. The use of the strong verb \"merge\" accentuates the difficulty Natasha is having to distinguish the days as they go by, possibly creating a blurred sense of reality whilst living with the restrictions.<nl><nl>2.2 \"spend the whole day in bed and its really taking a toll on me mentally\": is showing traits of a mental health disorder due to the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>When Natasha was asked how her daily life had changed, she proceeded to emphasise that the gym after the first lockdown, had allowed her to make progress \"mentally and physically\". However, the gyms were forced to close again following the second national lockdown. This proved to be a significant impact for Natasha \u2013 as further down in the answer she stated that she would \"spend the whole day in bed\". This may suggest that she may have been experiencing a mental health related disorder which could have been onset due to the second lockdown. This may portray the risk that the restrictions have towards the well-being of students. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, Natasha has had a wide range of negative changes and experiences whilst being a university student during the global pandemic\u2013 most aspects do relate to the new introduction of social distancing: which has proven to be a big change for her as she thrives of socialising and meeting new people. Natasha who has moved out from their hometown and is now situated in the city where she attends university is likely to feel lonely due to not being around friends or family. The decline in mental health has been evident \u2013 towards both her studies and daily life in general. Natasha finds it hard to live in the present and feels mentally absent on some days. This may indicate that being a student during the global pandemic is detrimental for individuals such as Natasha; leading to unhappiness, loneliness, disappointment, decline in mental health and being unmotivated. ", " Okay. Erm, so normally, every single day I have around two full meals. So, that would be breakfast and dinner. So, for breakfast, I normally have either baked oats, erm, and that will be with different toppings so, for example, be like golden syrup, white chocolate. And then I can have like a cup of tea or a hot chocolate with it. Other times, I might be having scrambled eggs, toast and, erm, tea. I don\u2019t really do too much breakfast because I normally just kind of make it to the  <unintelligible>  bus because I\u2019m rushing for work.

So, after that, I stay up quite late as well, I stay up till around two o\u2019clock in the morning.

So, obviously, I try make as, like, as an exciting dinner as I can do, really,  <cough> . So, I think that\u2019s, obviously, my biggest meal as well so, yeah, a hundred percent say dinner.<new>Erm, I would definitely say it\u2019s between Italian and, erm,  <regional_adj>  food. Erm, just because Italian, erm, I love pasta, I love the pizza, erm, it\u2019s just really easy to make as well. So, living at uni like I\u2019m stocked up on pasta all the time. Erm, but  <regional_adj>  food, it\u2019s just because I\u2019ve grown up a lot, like around a lot of, erm,  <regional_adj>  people so, obviously, growing up I\u2019ve been eating  <regional_adj>  food and I\u2019ve just really grown to like it.

Lastly, another cognitive change that is observed is that the individuals affected by PTSD may lose interest in activities or avoid participating in them. These might be the activities that they enjoyed before the event occurred. <nl><nl>One of the biological changes observed is that the hippocampus is significantly smaller in individuals who develop PTSD. This region of the brain plays a role in memories related to emotion, therefore a smaller hippocampus represents a higher risk for developing PTSD after a traumatic event (Gilbertson 2002). Another biological change that is observed is the failure of the brain centres (e.g ventromedial frontal cortex) which dampens the activation of the brain's fear coordinating centre, the amygdala (Koenigs &amp; Grafman 2009). Therefore, the individual is unable to control the activation of fear after trauma."]}

{"id": "1f7fd453-d7e3-4fd9-a4c9-85fc302ced4408094", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Abstract <nl>The Stroop effect was introduced by John Ridley Stroop in 1935, the task works by examining the response time of the participant to name colors of words presented to them. Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent (CI) than the colour congruent (CC) condition. (M= 966.8, SD= 405.1). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( T= 403, n= 59, p= &lt; .001). Data shows that participants took longer to correctly identify the font colours when they were incongruent with the colour of the words written. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>The results that were found were consistent with previous research of Stroop (1935) and supported the hypothesis as participants did have a slower reaction time when identifying incongruent font colours and had a faster reaction time for the congruent condition. The reaction time was faster for the congruent condition because Cattell (1886) argued that wording reading is automatic therefore it\u2019s quicker for individuals to read the word represented to them in that condition. However, different research finding has been reported from a similar stroop task called emotional stroop (Williams et al. 1996).

In this lockdown period, it was reported that learners were mostly suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety (42.0%) (Kapasia, N., Paul, P., Roy, A., Saha, J., Zaveri, A., Mallick, R., ... &amp; Chouhan, P. 2020). The negative impact on student mental and physical well-being due to lockdown restrictions, may be seen as detrimental for their academia and overall performance. Other research has been carried out on the wider population, not students specifically, however the COVID-19 lockdown can be seen to affect others negatively, in terms of mental health. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderatesevere insomnia (Gualano, M. R., Lo Moro, G., Voglino, G., Bert, F., &amp; Siliquini, R. 2020). However, research on the wider student experience during COVID-19 in the UK lacks exposure, so the given indication to the gap, conducting this research could be beneficial to raise greater awareness to the subject.<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as the chosen method<nl>IPA is concerned with lived experience. Experience covers quite a lot of territory (Cooper, H. E., Camic, P. M., Long, D. L., Panter, A. T., Rindskopf, D. E., &amp; Sher, K. J. 2012). Furthermore, IPA focuses on the detailed examination of particulars, first providing an in-depth account of each case before moving to look for patterning\u2019s of convergence and divergence across cases (Eatough, V., &amp; Smith, J. A. 2008).  This method allows the researcher to analyse and understand an individual\u2019s experience towards a certain event \u2013 which in this case would be the global pandemic and how it has affected students: it allows us to explore different aspects that may have been impacted and gives us the chance to begin to comprehend those experiences. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>1. \"Feels like a waste of a university experience\"; a student who has been affected by the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>Missing out on experiences and opportunities as a university student, is a main theme in this account - which includes spending time with friends, enjoying the nightlife, parties and academic events (e.g. lectures and seminars). Natasha draws up on the fact that the university experience she is currently having is very different to what she had prior to the COVID-19 restrictions in her first year. Although, she highlights that she had been able to enjoy some of the perks of being a student in her first year of study, she emphasises the lack of it now and realises that she had taken for granted some of the opportunities she had in first year, as she states - \"I definitely should have taken those erm (.) opportunities and just spend it with the people I like being around\". This may highlight the idea that Natasha feels regret because certain experiences are not as readily available as they were before.<nl>1.1 \"I\u2019m not seeing my friends as often as I would do... I\u2019m not going out\": the negatives highlighted due to the lockdown. <nl>Natasha was asked to compare her first year to her current year of university, and the main focus had been that there is a lack of opportunity to go out with friends - to restaurants, clubs and parties: all of which have been impacted significantly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. Further down in the interview she once again emphasises the fact that she yearns for a greater chance to go out to social events: \"I really do miss going out with them and seeing them and spending time with them\". It may suggest that Natasha, who is already limited by the distance from university to her hometown and who may have relied on interaction from social events at university, has been severely impacted and may go on to feel \"lonely\" within these circumstances, as she had previously mentioned when asked who she was able to communicate with at the moment. <nl><nl>There is no doubt that one of the main disadvantages Natasha focuses on is the idea that her personality is hindered by the lockdown: \"there is a lot of downsides...one of the things I love the most like going out, seeing my friends\", she draws attention to this significant piece missing in her life and emphasises how much she enjoys going out and seeing my friends by using the word \"love\". Due to the restrictions there may be an imbalance of work and leisure, Natasha may feel as though she is trapped in unhappiness during this global pandemic. <nl>1.2 \"...I\u2019ve not met anyone new on my course which is a bit upsetting\": the lack of engagement due to face-to-face teaching being moved online. <nl>When Natasha was asked: \"How they get along with engaging with other students\" - the response steered in a direction where she expressed a disappointment in the lack of opportunity to meet new course mates. She stated this a couple of times whilst answering this question: \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\", which may indicate that she has been deeply affected by the fact that the opportunity to engage with other students has been stripped away.<nl>University can be advertised amongst students as being a place where there is a chance to meet many different people - however, the outlook has changed significantly as those opportunities have been limited due to the restrictions; \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\" - Natasha emphasises that university no longer serves the purpose of networking and meeting new people because of social distancing.<nl><nl>2.0 \"...detached mentally from my studies\": recognising the lack of motivation.<nl>Main theme in this segment is how Natasha highlights the depletion of her mental well-being towards her studies and daily life. The lack of face-to-face teaching seems to be the reason for this, as further down the interview she mentions - \"I don\u2019t feel like a uni student (.) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m mentally there so my motivation has decreased signi-significantly\" which further supports the idea that the restrictions are detrimental to university students - due to the vast amount of lectures being moved online. This mentality and decrease of motivation may indicate a severe impact towards Natasha\u2019s mental health and well-being during this period of time. However, this could also be catastrophic for her university grades, as the lack of motivation may hinder the quality of her work and may lead her to underachieve. <nl><nl>2.1 \"...my mind is always in autopilot\": there is a lack of conscious control. <nl>Natasha goes on to use this phrase to describe her consciousness during the days in lockdown. This may emphasise the idea that her time spent in lockdown is constant and uneventful leading her to lose conscious awareness of what she is doing. The use of the word \"autopilot\" underlines the fact that she is aware that she is mentally detached from her life due to the sudden societal changes from the virus. On the other hand, it can be implied that she is comparing herself to that of a machine - where she is constantly stuck in a pattern doing the same thing daily.<nl>She goes on to mention that her \"days kinda merge into one\"- and further explains that she finds it easy to \"lose track\" of what she is doing and what she \"should be doing\",  which may lead to imply that lockdown has had both mental and physical obstacles, that Natasha has encountered and finds it difficult to plan her days and keep to a schedule. The use of the strong verb \"merge\" accentuates the difficulty Natasha is having to distinguish the days as they go by, possibly creating a blurred sense of reality whilst living with the restrictions.<nl><nl>2.2 \"spend the whole day in bed and its really taking a toll on me mentally\": is showing traits of a mental health disorder due to the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>When Natasha was asked how her daily life had changed, she proceeded to emphasise that the gym after the first lockdown, had allowed her to make progress \"mentally and physically\". However, the gyms were forced to close again following the second national lockdown. This proved to be a significant impact for Natasha \u2013 as further down in the answer she stated that she would \"spend the whole day in bed\". This may suggest that she may have been experiencing a mental health related disorder which could have been onset due to the second lockdown. This may portray the risk that the restrictions have towards the well-being of students. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, Natasha has had a wide range of negative changes and experiences whilst being a university student during the global pandemic\u2013 most aspects do relate to the new introduction of social distancing: which has proven to be a big change for her as she thrives of socialising and meeting new people. Natasha who has moved out from their hometown and is now situated in the city where she attends university is likely to feel lonely due to not being around friends or family. The decline in mental health has been evident \u2013 towards both her studies and daily life in general. Natasha finds it hard to live in the present and feels mentally absent on some days. This may indicate that being a student during the global pandemic is detrimental for individuals such as Natasha; leading to unhappiness, loneliness, disappointment, decline in mental health and being unmotivated.

{"id": "522f8301-917c-4dc8-ac9f-af18d03117dd05587", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Abstract <nl>The Stroop effect was introduced by John Ridley Stroop in 1935, the task works by examining the response time of the participant to name colors of words presented to them. Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent (CI) than the colour congruent (CC) condition. (M= 966.8, SD= 405.1). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( T= 403, n= 59, p= &lt; .001). Data shows that participants took longer to correctly identify the font colours when they were incongruent with the colour of the words written. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>The results that were found were consistent with previous research of Stroop (1935) and supported the hypothesis as participants did have a slower reaction time when identifying incongruent font colours and had a faster reaction time for the congruent condition. The reaction time was faster for the congruent condition because Cattell (1886) argued that wording reading is automatic therefore it\u2019s quicker for individuals to read the word represented to them in that condition. However, different research finding has been reported from a similar stroop task called emotional stroop (Williams et al. 1996). It was found that the emotional Stroop involves only emotional and neutral words and that color does not affect reaction time because it does not conflict with word meaning. The classic stroop test shows that the reaction time is slower because there is a conflict between an incongruent color and the word.

Participants were assigned a mental arithmetic task to complete between study and recognition stages. They completed two consecutive word recognition tasks: one on its own and one concurrently with a finger tapping task where a metronome was used to track time per second (1Hz). In order to counterbalance, a Latin square was used to minimize order effect.

Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001).", "Hi,<nl>I still have not received my order which is very frustrating.

Erm, at the minute as well, when I'm at home, there\u2019s, everyone\u2019s at home at the minute, well, everyone was at home for a few weeks. So, with more people, erm, more people in the house, what we ate, what I ate lunchtime changed. So, sometimes, instead of just me making myself a sandwich, if there\u2019s four or five of us in the house, we might make something together. Or if my dad\u2019s at home. I think I eat a lot more in the house, probably, when my dad\u2019s at home in the day because instead of me making myself a salad, he\u2019ll be like frying some bacon or something and I\u2019ll come downstairs and be like, \"I don\u2019t want salad now,\"  <laugh>  and I\u2019ll have a bacon sandwich. So, I think in that way, I'm probably eating a bit less healthily.<new>Erm, probably just a cup of tea. Erm, just, think it\u2019s always, I dunno. I could always have a cup of tea, like sometimes, I'm not in the mood for like an alcoholic drink or fizzy drinks, I'm not that big on them.

After, the participants were shown a list of 30 words before they were given a word recognition task where the 30 previously seen targets were presented with 30 previously unseen words. Words were moderately concrete, low imageability words. Four lists of 30 words were used, participants were asked to complete a mental arithmetic task between study and recognition stages.

Overall, 22 participants used, and they were given a cued visual attention task. Cued with a fixation cross for 34ms, then an arrow cue would indicate which hemifield a target would appear in. There was a 50% chance of being cued left or right, 75% of the trials were valid and 25% of trials were invalid. Results indicated that parietal regions showed stronger alpha lower band frequency suppression contralateral to the attended hemifield. Similar results for upper frequencies.

To prevent motor movements, the participants should be given strict instructions to follow due to the sensitivity of the EEG.

Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001)."]}

That\u2019s all.", "Unipolar depression is a form of major depression, this is when the patient focuses on negative emotions. Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001)."]}

{"id": "48e5c232-bf0f-433a-bfb8-dcf6a151d026", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Aims and Research Questions<nl>The lockdown amidst COVID-19 has made significant disruptions in academic activities. In this lockdown period, it was reported that learners were mostly suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety (42.0%) (Kapasia, N., Paul, P., Roy, A., Saha, J., Zaveri, A., Mallick, R., ... &amp; Chouhan, P. 2020). The negative impact on student mental and physical well-being due to lockdown restrictions, may be seen as detrimental for their academia and overall performance. Other research has been carried out on the wider population, not students specifically, however the COVID-19 lockdown can be seen to affect others negatively, in terms of mental health. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderatesevere insomnia (Gualano, M. R., Lo Moro, G., Voglino, G., Bert, F., &amp; Siliquini, R. 2020). However, research on the wider student experience during COVID-19 in the UK lacks exposure, so the given indication to the gap, conducting this research could be beneficial to raise greater awareness to the subject.<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as the chosen method<nl>IPA is concerned with lived experience. Experience covers quite a lot of territory (Cooper, H. E., Camic, P. M., Long, D. L., Panter, A. T., Rindskopf, D. E., &amp; Sher, K. J. 2012). Furthermore, IPA focuses on the detailed examination of particulars, first providing an in-depth account of each case before moving to look for patterning\u2019s of convergence and divergence across cases (Eatough, V., &amp; Smith, J. A. 2008).  This method allows the researcher to analyse and understand an individual\u2019s experience towards a certain event \u2013 which in this case would be the global pandemic and how it has affected students: it allows us to explore different aspects that may have been impacted and gives us the chance to begin to comprehend those experiences. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>1. \"Feels like a waste of a university experience\"; a student who has been affected by the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>Missing out on experiences and opportunities as a university student, is a main theme in this account - which includes spending time with friends, enjoying the nightlife, parties and academic events (e.g. lectures and seminars). Natasha draws up on the fact that the university experience she is currently having is very different to what she had prior to the COVID-19 restrictions in her first year. Although, she highlights that she had been able to enjoy some of the perks of being a student in her first year of study, she emphasises the lack of it now and realises that she had taken for granted some of the opportunities she had in first year, as she states - \"I definitely should have taken those erm (.) opportunities and just spend it with the people I like being around\". This may highlight the idea that Natasha feels regret because certain experiences are not as readily available as they were before.<nl>1.1 \"I\u2019m not seeing my friends as often as I would do... I\u2019m not going out\": the negatives highlighted due to the lockdown. <nl>Natasha was asked to compare her first year to her current year of university, and the main focus had been that there is a lack of opportunity to go out with friends - to restaurants, clubs and parties: all of which have been impacted significantly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. Further down in the interview she once again emphasises the fact that she yearns for a greater chance to go out to social events: \"I really do miss going out with them and seeing them and spending time with them\". It may suggest that Natasha, who is already limited by the distance from university to her hometown and who may have relied on interaction from social events at university, has been severely impacted and may go on to feel \"lonely\" within these circumstances, as she had previously mentioned when asked who she was able to communicate with at the moment. <nl><nl>There is no doubt that one of the main disadvantages Natasha focuses on is the idea that her personality is hindered by the lockdown: \"there is a lot of downsides...one of the things I love the most like going out, seeing my friends\", she draws attention to this significant piece missing in her life and emphasises how much she enjoys going out and seeing my friends by using the word \"love\". Due to the restrictions there may be an imbalance of work and leisure, Natasha may feel as though she is trapped in unhappiness during this global pandemic. <nl>1.2 \"...I\u2019ve not met anyone new on my course which is a bit upsetting\": the lack of engagement due to face-to-face teaching being moved online. <nl>When Natasha was asked: \"How they get along with engaging with other students\" - the response steered in a direction where she expressed a disappointment in the lack of opportunity to meet new course mates. She stated this a couple of times whilst answering this question: \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\", which may indicate that she has been deeply affected by the fact that the opportunity to engage with other students has been stripped away.<nl>University can be advertised amongst students as being a place where there is a chance to meet many different people - however, the outlook has changed significantly as those opportunities have been limited due to the restrictions; \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\" - Natasha emphasises that university no longer serves the purpose of networking and meeting new people because of social distancing.<nl><nl>2.0 \"...detached mentally from my studies\": recognising the lack of motivation.<nl>Main theme in this segment is how Natasha highlights the depletion of her mental well-being towards her studies and daily life. The lack of face-to-face teaching seems to be the reason for this, as further down the interview she mentions - \"I don\u2019t feel like a uni student (.) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m mentally there so my motivation has decreased signi-significantly\" which further supports the idea that the restrictions are detrimental to university students - due to the vast amount of lectures being moved online. This mentality and decrease of motivation may indicate a severe impact towards Natasha\u2019s mental health and well-being during this period of time. However, this could also be catastrophic for her university grades, as the lack of motivation may hinder the quality of her work and may lead her to underachieve. <nl><nl>2.1 \"...my mind is always in autopilot\": there is a lack of conscious control. <nl>Natasha goes on to use this phrase to describe her consciousness during the days in lockdown. This may emphasise the idea that her time spent in lockdown is constant and uneventful leading her to lose conscious awareness of what she is doing. The use of the word \"autopilot\" underlines the fact that she is aware that she is mentally detached from her life due to the sudden societal changes from the virus. On the other hand, it can be implied that she is comparing herself to that of a machine - where she is constantly stuck in a pattern doing the same thing daily.<nl>She goes on to mention that her \"days kinda merge into one\"- and further explains that she finds it easy to \"lose track\" of what she is doing and what she \"should be doing\",  which may lead to imply that lockdown has had both mental and physical obstacles, that Natasha has encountered and finds it difficult to plan her days and keep to a schedule. The use of the strong verb \"merge\" accentuates the difficulty Natasha is having to distinguish the days as they go by, possibly creating a blurred sense of reality whilst living with the restrictions.<nl><nl>2.2 \"spend the whole day in bed and its really taking a toll on me mentally\": is showing traits of a mental health disorder due to the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>When Natasha was asked how her daily life had changed, she proceeded to emphasise that the gym after the first lockdown, had allowed her to make progress \"mentally and physically\". However, the gyms were forced to close again following the second national lockdown. This proved to be a significant impact for Natasha \u2013 as further down in the answer she stated that she would \"spend the whole day in bed\". This may suggest that she may have been experiencing a mental health related disorder which could have been onset due to the second lockdown. This may portray the risk that the restrictions have towards the well-being of students. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, Natasha has had a wide range of negative changes and experiences whilst being a university student during the global pandemic\u2013 most aspects do relate to the new introduction of social distancing: which has proven to be a big change for her as she thrives of socialising and meeting new people. Natasha who has moved out from their hometown and is now situated in the city where she attends university is likely to feel lonely due to not being around friends or family. The decline in mental health has been evident \u2013 towards both her studies and daily life in general. Natasha finds it hard to live in the present and feels mentally absent on some days. This may indicate that being a student during the global pandemic is detrimental for individuals such as Natasha; leading to unhappiness, loneliness, disappointment, decline in mental health and being unmotivated.

These are experiences and sensations which are not comprehensible to others, but to the person experiencing them. Hallucinations include patients hearing, seeing, tasting, touching, and smelling things. An example of hallucinations is the patient may hear voices that may seem angry or urgent and often make demands on them which results in the patient getting injured.<nl><nl>Another positive symptom is delusions, these are beliefs which may conflict with reality. A schizophrenic patient will hold onto those beliefs even though they may be evidence that disproves those false beliefs. An example is paranoid delusions, they may believe people are out to hurt them or the thought people are doing things when there is no evidence that these things are taking place. <nl><nl>Lastly, a positive symptom of schizophrenia is thought disorder. This is a disorganised way of thinking which leads to abnormal ways of expressing language when speaking or writing. An example of a thought disorder is thought blocking. This the patient interrupts themselves inappropriately mid-sentence and changes the topic of conversation. They may pause for several seconds or minutes."]}

Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001).", "Oh, to cook, erm, I don\u2019t really cook that much.

Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent (CI) than the colour congruent (CC) condition. (M= 966.8, SD= 405.1). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( T= 403, n= 59, p= &lt; .001). Data shows that participants took longer to correctly identify the font colours when they were incongruent with the colour of the words written. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>The results that were found were consistent with previous research of Stroop (1935) and supported the hypothesis as participants did have a slower reaction time when identifying incongruent font colours and had a faster reaction time for the congruent condition. The reaction time was faster for the congruent condition because Cattell (1886) argued that wording reading is automatic therefore it\u2019s quicker for individuals to read the word represented to them in that condition. However, different research finding has been reported from a similar stroop task called emotional stroop (Williams et al. 1996). It was found that the emotional Stroop involves only emotional and neutral words and that color does not affect reaction time because it does not conflict with word meaning. The classic stroop test shows that the reaction time is slower because there is a conflict between an incongruent color and the word. Furthermore,  Salthouse and Meinz (1995) argue that even though age differences specific to stroop interference were minimal, other research may show the relationship between age and Stroop interference was still significant (West &amp; Baylis, 1998). <nl><nl>Finally, some of the methodological issues regarding the experiment were that volunteer sampling was used, only university students participated. Findings cannot be generalised to those who did not volunteer and the finding may not be representative of the whole population. An improvement could be made by selecting people of all ages not just university students. Another issue was that the experiment was not completed in a controlled environment, this means they could have had help from others. Another improvement could be that all the participants complete the test in a psychology lab. Also there may have been extraneous variables which may have affected the results, e.g. some participants may have completed at 9am, they would most likely been tired and have had a slower reaction time. This can be improved by making sure all students complete the test at the same time."]}

The two independent variables (IV) are the task conditions (dual and single) and the other is age which has three levels (young, young-old and old-old). The dependent variable (DV) is the proportion of correctly recognised words corrected for false recognition.<nl>Material: <nl>The materials that were used were 4 lists of 30 words from the Toronto word pool (Friendly, Franklin, Hoffman, &amp; Rubin, 1982, see http:euclid.psych.yorku.cashinyTWP), a metronome and a Latin square.<nl>Procedure:<nl>Initially, participants were given 30 words following a word recognition task. Within this task they were presented with the 30 previously seen and 30 previously unseen targets. The words were moderately concrete and low imageability. Participants were assigned a mental arithmetic task to complete between study and recognition stages. They completed two consecutive word recognition tasks: one on its own and one concurrently with a finger tapping task where a metronome was used to track time per second (1Hz). In order to counterbalance, a Latin square was used to minimize order effect. False recognition was corrected and presented as decimal fractions at the end where the numbers were between 0 and 1 indicated the proportion of correctly recognised words. To ensure the study was ethical participants were debriefed at the end.<nl>Results<nl>Levene\u2019s and Shapiro-Wilk tests weren\u2019t significant (p&gt;0.05) so this means the data are suitable for parametric analysis.<nl><table><nl>Table 1. showed that the mean recall for the young condition was higher than the mean recall of young-old and old-old condition. The main effect of age showed that this difference was significant with a large effect size of 51% in proportion of correct responses (PCR), (F(2,57)=74.9,p&lt;0.001,n\u00b2=0.52) and 95% CI ranges did not overlap suggesting that population means would be different.<nl><table><nl>Table 2. shows that reaction times were faster for dual than single tasks and this difference was significant with a small effect size of 2% in PCR and 95% CI ranges do not overlap (F(1,57)=4.32,p&lt;0.042, n\u00b2=0.018), suggesting the population means would be the same.<nl><table><nl>Table. 3 shows the mean for old-old participants for both single and dual tasks was lower in comparison to the mean in single and dual tasks for young and young-old participants.

Moreover, there is no difference in the mean for correct responses for the young-old group in dual and task conditions (t(57) =0.03, p = 1.000). The post hoc tests 95% confidence interval range did overlap suggesting that the population mean would be different.

Erm, they\u2019re wearing kind of blackish clothes, dark clothes, erm, even the background is kind of dark. Erm, but they're both smiling, erm.

One is standing up and leaning over a little bit. She is wearing a black and white stripey t-shirt and some jeans, and then sat down next to her is another girl in a leather jacket \u2013 not a leather jacket, a denim jacket. Erm, she, the girl sitting down, is laughing. And the woman standing up is smiling a little bit, but she\u2019s not looking directly at her. Erm, maybe they\u2019re looking at something together, but that\u2019s not in the picture. The picture is just the girls. The background is just plain white. Erm, there might be some shapes underneath it, I can\u2019t really see. But for the most part it\u2019s either white or blocked out, so the focus of the picture is the girls. Erm, they look like maybe they\u2019re friends or maybe they\u2019re in a study group together, like they could be students. They look about student age. I\u2019d say like early twenties kind of age. And yeah, that\u2019s the first image. The second picture has got two boys in it, and the fo- the main, at the front of the picture is a laptop, is an Apple MacBook. Erm, and the background is, I think they\u2019re in like a study booth, maybe. Erm, there\u2019s a table at the front, and then the back is like black with green spots on it, different sizes, dots.

And the other boy is wearing like a, I think it\u2019s like plaid or flannel, or whatever, a shirt over a white t-shirt. And he is looking at the laptop, and the other boy is looking at him. Again, I think students, in probably a study session. I think they might be in a study group together. They both ar- they seem happy to be there,  <laugh>  I don\u2019t know, kind of not outwardly smiling but a bit of a smile. Erm, seems like they get on, but I don\u2019t know if I would say, they don\u2019t really look like best friends I would say. So maybe they\u2019ve met in a study group, or maybe they\u2019re just acquaintances, I don\u2019t know. And then the third picture is, I guess again might be a study situation, because there\u2019s a boy in it holding a book that looks, it\u2019s quite a thick book, so maybe a textbook. Erm, they, there\u2019s a table at the front, like a glass table, and they\u2019re both sat, there are two people in it, both sat on a bench, I think? Erm, sorry, this one\u2019s a boy and a girl. The boy is holding a textbook and he\u2019s got a coat on, and some, I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s, I don\u2019t know. The girl has got her leather jacket on and some boots, and the background is, erm, is black with white dots making up the circle, and then a bigger circle, bigger circle, etc., etc. Erm, and maybe like I said also in a study session, erm, kind of setting, like students. They\u2019re both looking at someone else who\u2019s not in the picture, although there is a hand, so I guess that\u2019s the person\u2019s hand.

But maybe, yeah, the restaurants I went to would be nicer restaurants and even might have a dessert,  <laugh> , I don\u2019t know.<new>I have a takeaway once a week  <laugh> , as I just said so we never used to do that. But that\u2019s something we\u2019ve started doing. Erm, I guess just to break your week up a little bit, I suppose it gets quite samey. Erm, at the minute as well, when I'm at home, there\u2019s, everyone\u2019s at home at the minute, well, everyone was at home for a few weeks. So, with more people, erm, more people in the house, what we ate, what I ate lunchtime changed. So, sometimes, instead of just me making myself a sandwich, if there\u2019s four or five of us in the house, we might make something together. Or if my dad\u2019s at home. I think I eat a lot more in the house, probably, when my dad\u2019s at home in the day because instead of me making myself a salad, he\u2019ll be like frying some bacon or something and I\u2019ll come downstairs and be like, \"I don\u2019t want salad now,\"  <laugh>  and I\u2019ll have a bacon sandwich. So, I think in that way, I'm probably eating a bit less healthily.<new>Erm, probably just a cup of tea. Erm, just, think it\u2019s always, I dunno. I could always have a cup of tea, like sometimes, I'm not in the mood for like an alcoholic drink or fizzy drinks, I'm not that big on them.

Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent (CI) than the colour congruent (CC) condition. (M= 966.8, SD= 405.1). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( T= 403, n= 59, p= &lt; .001). Data shows that participants took longer to correctly identify the font colours when they were incongruent with the colour of the words written. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>The results that were found were consistent with previous research of Stroop (1935) and supported the hypothesis as participants did have a slower reaction time when identifying incongruent font colours and had a faster reaction time for the congruent condition. The reaction time was faster for the congruent condition because Cattell (1886) argued that wording reading is automatic therefore it\u2019s quicker for individuals to read the word represented to them in that condition. However, different research finding has been reported from a similar stroop task called emotional stroop (Williams et al. 1996). It was found that the emotional Stroop involves only emotional and neutral words and that color does not affect reaction time because it does not conflict with word meaning. The classic stroop test shows that the reaction time is slower because there is a conflict between an incongruent color and the word. Furthermore,  Salthouse and Meinz (1995) argue that even though age differences specific to stroop interference were minimal, other research may show the relationship between age and Stroop interference was still significant (West &amp; Baylis, 1998). <nl><nl>Finally, some of the methodological issues regarding the experiment were that volunteer sampling was used, only university students participated. Findings cannot be generalised to those who did not volunteer and the finding may not be representative of the whole population. An improvement could be made by selecting people of all ages not just university students. Another issue was that the experiment was not completed in a controlled environment, this means they could have had help from others. Another improvement could be that all the participants complete the test in a psychology lab. Also there may have been extraneous variables which may have affected the results, e.g. some participants may have completed at 9am, they would most likely been tired and have had a slower reaction time. This can be improved by making sure all students complete the test at the same time."]}

This study will focus on the politeness strategies used by each gender when critiquing the contestants. To achieve this, it will investigate the number of lines of speech, the use of positive as opposed to negative adjectives and the use of hedges or intensifiers. A hedge is a linguistic device used to mitigate a statement by lowering epistemic modality and directness with the goal of reducing the threat to face (Salager-Meyer, 1994; Brown and Levinson, 1978.) On the other hand, an intensifier is an adverb or adverbial phrase used to give emphasis (Bolinger, 1972). <nl>The data used in this study is from The Great British Bake Off (which will from here onwards be referred to as GBBO) and MasterChef: The Professionals, which will simply be referred to as MasterChef. These two programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions, but MasterChef features professional chefs and GBBO amateur bakers. There is also a difference in formality as GBBO is more informal and light-hearted which is shown by its two presenters both being comedians. On the other hand, MasterChef is more formal in tone and takes a more serious approach. <nl>This topic has been chosen as it combines politeness theories with gender theory in order to examine how they interact with each other, applying this to a competition environment. Both of the datasets are from television shows therefore it is important to take into account that they may be edited to portray people in a certain way or to best fulfil the main purpose of the shows, which is to entertain. It will be interesting to see how this artificial environment impacts the judges as they may be inclined to be more polite than usual in order to portray themselves well on television, or less polite if their career is based on them playing a \"villain\" role.<nl><nl>Research Background <nl>There has been much debate by linguistics over the relationship between gender and language and the effect the former has on the latter. One of the seminal theorists in this subject is Robin Lakoff (1975) who suggested that there are fundamental differences in how men and women use language. Most relevant to this paper was her identified differences in the use of polite forms, with women typically using more polite forms than men. Janet Holmes (2013) also agreed that women are more likely to use polite forms, although acknowledged that there are differences depending on factors such as the context of the interaction and the specific people involved. She argued that: <nl>\"when all the necessary reservations and qualifications have been taken into account, I think the answer is \u2018yes, women are more polite than men\u2019\" (Holmes, 1995: 5). <nl>It has also been suggested that women use more polite forms as they are more powerless than men (Deuchar, 1988). One theory that supports this is the dominance theory which investigated the number of interruptions between men and women in a mixed gender conversation (Zimmerman and West, 1975). The study found that men are much more likely to interrupt than women and across the eleven conversations they recorded women interrupted only twice whereas men interrupted 46 times. This supports the idea that women are more polite than men, however the study only has a small sample size of 35 participants, all of whom were from a similar background, and is over 45 years old. <nl>Looking more closely at politeness, it can be defined as a type of communication that shows respect and gives some benefit to the other communicators (Leech, 2014). It is an act which aims to maintain the other participants\u2019 positive and negative face (Goffman, 1967). <nl>Leech\u2019s politeness principle (1983) argues that speakers must follow six maxims in order to be considered polite. The theory builds on Grice\u2019s maxims of conversation (1975) but expands these maxim\u2019s and focuses them specifically on appearing polite. These maxims of politeness are; tact, generosity, approbation, modesty and agreement. This study will focus on the maxim of approbation, which involves maximising expressions of praise and approval and lessening the expressions of dispraise. <nl>In a recent study, these maxims were applied to high school students and their interactions with teachers in order to investigate how gender influences politeness (Ningsih et al., 2020). The study used a qualitive approach and gathered data through observations and recordings. They found that both male and female students adhered to the politeness principle more strongly with female teachers than with male teachers. This could suggest that how polite a speaker is depends on the gender of the person they are speaking to more than their own gender identification. Although this study looks only at the speaker and does not take into account the gender of the addressee, this could account for some of the patterns of politeness encountered and therefore is worth taking into consideration. <nl>Looking at this previous research, it could be expected that the female judges in this study will show more behaviours associated with politeness than the male judges, which will be shown through an increase of positive adjectives and a decrease of negative adjectives. It is also expected that the female judges will more often seek to minimise the amount of dispraise given and use hedges to save the hearer\u2019s positive face, whilst using more intensifiers to emphasise praise. It is also anticipated that males will dominate the conversation more, which could be seen as impolite as they allow less room in the conversation for the female judges to speak.<nl><nl>Methodology <nl>The data used in this investigation is from the final episode of the 2020 series of GBBO and the 2020 final of MasterChef. In each episode there are three contestants remaining and so, by using the first challenge they are given in each, there are three sets of comparable data for each show. Each judgement was then transcribed using the key in appendix one. The narration in MasterChef was excluded from the transcripts as it was edited in later and therefore was not part of the conversation being analysed. This analysis only focused on the judge\u2019s communication; however, the contestants and presenter\u2019s speech were included in the transcriptions for context. <nl>These programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions and so the type of praisecriticism given is comparable. However, the difference in tone and level of formality between the programmes allows a deeper investigation into the impact of context on politeness. It will be of interest to see whether the hypothesises are realised and whether the tone and formality of each programme impacts this, and if so to what extent. These programmes were also chosen as they have mixed gender judging panels thus the impact of gender can be observed. <nl>Once the data had been collected, it was analysed using a quantitative approach. The number of lines of speech by each of the judges was counted in each extract and placed into table one. In MasterChef there were three judges, two of which were male. In order to calculate the number of lines of speech for the males, the number for each judge was added together and then divided by two. Although this removes the influence of the individual, which is a disadvantage, it allows the proportion of speech by each gender to be directly compared, which for the purposes of this investigation was deemed more important. <nl>When counting the lines of speech, each line was counted as a whole regardless of the length. However, there is one result which contains a half due to the calculation used to find the average. Speech was also counted as one line if it was transcribed across two due to interruption but the utterance carried on unbroken. <nl>The use of adjectives was also counted and placed into a table (table two) and the context of the utterance was used to determine whether an adjective was used positively as praise, or negatively to criticise. The same method was then applied to the use of hedges and intensifiers, which were then discussed in a qualitative light to determine the effect they had on the overall politeness of each statement.<nl><nl>Findings <nl>i. Amount of speech by male and female judges <nl>The following table summarises the number of lines of speech made by male and female judges in each dataset. As there were two male judges in MasterChef the average number of lines of speech made between them has been used, as mentioned in the methodology. <nl><table><nl>Looking at GBBO first, on average the male judge (Paul) utters more lines of speech than the female judge (Prue). In the judgements of contestants one and three, Paul utters eight lines of speech as opposed to Prue\u2019s six lines, an increase of 28.57%. This is befitting the hypothesis that the male judge will speak more than the female judge, however the data featuring contestant two conflicts with this. In this instance, Prue has one more line of speech than Paul which is a 22.22% difference. Overall, Paul speaks more than Prue in two of the three extracts, and in there is a greater difference between the judges when Paul is the one speaking more. Across all three extracts Paul is shown to utter 16.22% more lines of speech than Prue, conforming to the expected results. <nl>Analysing the MasterChef results, the males (Gregg and Marcus) utter more lines of speech in the judgements of contestants one and two than the female judge (Monica). In the transcript featuring contestant one there is a 40% difference in the number of utterances, and in the next there is a 22.22% difference. This is a greater increase in the amount of speech by males as opposed to females than was seen in GBBO. Yet, when the judgement of contestant three is analysed, the largest difference in speech of all the transcripts is shown with Monica speaking 66.67% more lines than the male judges. This means that overall, there is only a 3.39% difference between the male and female judges, with the female judge having uttered more lines in total. This disagrees with the hypothesis that men would talk more but the difference in utterance of lines is minimal. <nl>To conclude, the data from GBBO is in accordance with the hypothesis made that males will utter more lines of speech than females, but the data from MasterChef contradicts it. There are a few possible explanations for why this might have occurred. One explanation is the difference in tone between the two shows; In MasterChef the setting is more formal and professional whereas GBBO is a more informal setting where the judges interact with the contestants more colloquially. Therefore, GBBO mirrors normal conversations more than MasterChef and the context relates more closely to that of the studies researched for this paper. There is also a difference in the way the programmes are formatted. The judgement in GBBO is more like a conversation in the first challenge, so there are examples of turn-taking within the conversation. In contrast, on MasterChef the judges speak one at a time in longer instances and there are no conversations between them. This could influence the results as it means the participants are not dominating the conversation but rather giving a longer individual monologue. <nl>It is also of note that the extracts transcribed are only a couple of minutes long and therefore there is only a relatively small amount of data. In a longer conversation there is a possibility that the difference between male and female speech could become more defined.<nl><nl>ii. Use of adjectives <nl>When categorising the use of adjectives into positive or negative classifications, the context of the sentence was used to determine what category was most appropriate. They were then collated into the table below. <nl><table><nl>For example, \"wobbly\" was classed as a positive adjective as it was used in the utterance \"I like the wobbly lines\" (Appendix three, lines 20-22). <nl>Analysing the use of adjectives by the GBBO judges, Prue used more positive adjectives with each contestant as well as a greater range of adjectives. Looking at the use of negative adjectives, both judges used a similar number however Paul used one more. Therefore, the GBBO data aligns with the hypothesis that the female judge would use more adjectives that signal praise, and the male more negative adjectives. <nl>When comparing this to the results for the MasterChef data, Monica used an equal number of negative adjectives as Marcus, and one more than Gregg who did not use any. This contradicts the hypothesis and suggests that Monica is more willing to risk threatening the contestants face than Gregg, who only uses compliments. When judging the first contestant, Gregg used seven times as many adjectives to give praise than Monica did, and more than twice as many as Marcus. With the next contestant all three judges used the same number of positive adjectives and with the final contestant Monica used the most; using four times as many as Gregg and twice as many as Marcus. Ranking the judges based on their use of positive minus negative adjectives, Marcus and Monica both ranked the same and Gregg ranked highest meaning he is most concerned with politeness and least willing to flout the maxim of approbation. In summary, the data from MasterChef does not support the hypothesis and contrasts with the GBBO results. <nl><nl>iii. Use of hedges and intensifiers <nl>Within this table a colour-coding system has been using to differentiate between the hedges and intensifiers that have been used in relation to negative statements, and those that have been used positively. Text in green represents the words and phrases that have be used in relation to praise, and red has been used for text that relates to dispraise or criticism. <nl><table><nl>The intensifier \"very very\" was kept as one phrase within the table rather than two instances of the word \"very\" to emphasise how strongly the praise was given. <nl>The results from the analysis on hedging and intensifiers is similar to the patterns seen when investigating the use of adjectives. In the GBBO data, Prue used more positively associated hedges and intensifiers and fewer negative ones than Paul. <nl>Similarly, in the MasterChef data Gregg did not use any negative forms of these linguistic features which correlates with his use of adjectives. Although Marcus used more negative forms of the features than Monica, he also used more positive forms therefore showing they have an equal level of politeness as shown with their use of adjectives. <nl>Overall, this section again confirms that the judges in GBBO conform to the ideas of gender and politeness, whereas the judges in MasterChef do not. This could be down to the individual\u2019s character, as the social constructivist theory suggests that gender is only one part of our identity that influences communication; Personality, status, level of education and ethnicity also all serve to shape our communication (Burr, 2015). It suggests that people make each element of this construction relevant or irrelevant as is necessary. This suggests that Monica and Gregg could be choosing not to make their gender relevant to their role as judge, and each is relying on other factors to influence their use of praise instead. <nl><nl>Discussion <nl>One section that is particularly interesting is where Paul and Prue discussed the issues with Dave\u2019s custard slice in the GGBO. In the extract below, both judges use a mixture of hedges and praise to try and soften their criticism of Dave and minimise their flouting of the maxim of approbation. <nl><data_extract><nl>In cooking the adjective \"strong\" can be both positive or negative. In this extract Prue signals that she is using it positively by her use of the phrase \"I love the coffee\" before describing it as strong, thereby using it to praise Dave. The use of the intensifier \"really\" emphasises the strength of the flavour which adds to this praise. This extract also features the word \"stodgy\" three times. In the first instance, Paul used it to criticise Dave\u2019s custard which is an example of a positive face threatening act. However, Paul lessens the impact of the criticism by using the hedging phrase \"a little bit\" therefore minimising the expression of dispraise as laid out in Leech\u2019s maxim of approbation (1983). Prue then repeats this criticism however she uses the adjective \"stodgy\" twice with an emphasis on the first time. In this instance she is using the first expression of stodgy as a hedge to minimise the impact of the second expression, hereby implying it is not as bad as it could be and is only minorly stodgy. Again, this helps to minimise the impoliteness and helps to save face. \"Pretty\" is also used as a hedge in this extract, which lessens the compliment of it being \"delicious\". The use of the adverb \"still\" serves to further lessen it, so although Prue is paying a compliment, she is still acknowledging that the baking has flaws. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, the hypothesises that female judges would use more language concerned with politeness were realised to a certain extent. The patterns of communication shown by the GBBO judges did match up with what was expected, however the judges in MasterChef conformed to these expectations to a much lesser extent. This could be due to the formality of the show as opposed to the more colloquial nature of The Great British Bake Off, although it could also be due to the individual backgrounds and personalities of each judge. There is also a possibility that the gender of the contestant being judged has an impact on how the judges use politeness. Future research could investigate further by looking at a greater range of programmes and including more data for each. There is also an age difference of 35 years between the two female judges so it could be interesting to investigate deeper into how the changes in society between these years have influenced how women use language in reference to politeness.", "Hi <addr11_FN>,<nl><nl>Thank you for your email and for this opportunity.

The judgement in GBBO is more like a conversation in the first challenge, so there are examples of turn-taking within the conversation. In contrast, on MasterChef the judges speak one at a time in longer instances and there are no conversations between them. This could influence the results as it means the participants are not dominating the conversation but rather giving a longer individual monologue. <nl>It is also of note that the extracts transcribed are only a couple of minutes long and therefore there is only a relatively small amount of data. In a longer conversation there is a possibility that the difference between male and female speech could become more defined.<nl><nl>ii. Use of adjectives <nl>When categorising the use of adjectives into positive or negative classifications, the context of the sentence was used to determine what category was most appropriate. They were then collated into the table below. <nl><table><nl>For example, \"wobbly\" was classed as a positive adjective as it was used in the utterance \"I like the wobbly lines\" (Appendix three, lines 20-22). <nl>Analysing the use of adjectives by the GBBO judges, Prue used more positive adjectives with each contestant as well as a greater range of adjectives. Looking at the use of negative adjectives, both judges used a similar number however Paul used one more. Therefore, the GBBO data aligns with the hypothesis that the female judge would use more adjectives that signal praise, and the male more negative adjectives. <nl>When comparing this to the results for the MasterChef data, Monica used an equal number of negative adjectives as Marcus, and one more than Gregg who did not use any. This contradicts the hypothesis and suggests that Monica is more willing to risk threatening the contestants face than Gregg, who only uses compliments. When judging the first contestant, Gregg used seven times as many adjectives to give praise than Monica did, and more than twice as many as Marcus. With the next contestant all three judges used the same number of positive adjectives and with the final contestant Monica used the most; using four times as many as Gregg and twice as many as Marcus. Ranking the judges based on their use of positive minus negative adjectives, Marcus and Monica both ranked the same and Gregg ranked highest meaning he is most concerned with politeness and least willing to flout the maxim of approbation. In summary, the data from MasterChef does not support the hypothesis and contrasts with the GBBO results. <nl><nl>iii. Use of hedges and intensifiers <nl>Within this table a colour-coding system has been using to differentiate between the hedges and intensifiers that have been used in relation to negative statements, and those that have been used positively. Text in green represents the words and phrases that have be used in relation to praise, and red has been used for text that relates to dispraise or criticism. <nl><table><nl>The intensifier \"very very\" was kept as one phrase within the table rather than two instances of the word \"very\" to emphasise how strongly the praise was given. <nl>The results from the analysis on hedging and intensifiers is similar to the patterns seen when investigating the use of adjectives. In the GBBO data, Prue used more positively associated hedges and intensifiers and fewer negative ones than Paul. <nl>Similarly, in the MasterChef data Gregg did not use any negative forms of these linguistic features which correlates with his use of adjectives. Although Marcus used more negative forms of the features than Monica, he also used more positive forms therefore showing they have an equal level of politeness as shown with their use of adjectives. <nl>Overall, this section again confirms that the judges in GBBO conform to the ideas of gender and politeness, whereas the judges in MasterChef do not. This could be down to the individual\u2019s character, as the social constructivist theory suggests that gender is only one part of our identity that influences communication; Personality, status, level of education and ethnicity also all serve to shape our communication (Burr, 2015). It suggests that people make each element of this construction relevant or irrelevant as is necessary. This suggests that Monica and Gregg could be choosing not to make their gender relevant to their role as judge, and each is relying on other factors to influence their use of praise instead. <nl><nl>Discussion <nl>One section that is particularly interesting is where Paul and Prue discussed the issues with Dave\u2019s custard slice in the GGBO. In the extract below, both judges use a mixture of hedges and praise to try and soften their criticism of Dave and minimise their flouting of the maxim of approbation. <nl><data_extract><nl>In cooking the adjective \"strong\" can be both positive or negative. In this extract Prue signals that she is using it positively by her use of the phrase \"I love the coffee\" before describing it as strong, thereby using it to praise Dave. The use of the intensifier \"really\" emphasises the strength of the flavour which adds to this praise. This extract also features the word \"stodgy\" three times. In the first instance, Paul used it to criticise Dave\u2019s custard which is an example of a positive face threatening act. However, Paul lessens the impact of the criticism by using the hedging phrase \"a little bit\" therefore minimising the expression of dispraise as laid out in Leech\u2019s maxim of approbation (1983). Prue then repeats this criticism however she uses the adjective \"stodgy\" twice with an emphasis on the first time. In this instance she is using the first expression of stodgy as a hedge to minimise the impact of the second expression, hereby implying it is not as bad as it could be and is only minorly stodgy. Again, this helps to minimise the impoliteness and helps to save face. \"Pretty\" is also used as a hedge in this extract, which lessens the compliment of it being \"delicious\". The use of the adverb \"still\" serves to further lessen it, so although Prue is paying a compliment, she is still acknowledging that the baking has flaws. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, the hypothesises that female judges would use more language concerned with politeness were realised to a certain extent. The patterns of communication shown by the GBBO judges did match up with what was expected, however the judges in MasterChef conformed to these expectations to a much lesser extent. This could be due to the formality of the show as opposed to the more colloquial nature of The Great British Bake Off, although it could also be due to the individual backgrounds and personalities of each judge. There is also a possibility that the gender of the contestant being judged has an impact on how the judges use politeness. Future research could investigate further by looking at a greater range of programmes and including more data for each. There is also an age difference of 35 years between the two female judges so it could be interesting to investigate deeper into how the changes in society between these years have influenced how women use language in reference to politeness.", "Okay, erm, so, I would normally get up about eight and have a cup of tea.

Lastly, another cognitive change that is observed is that the individuals affected by PTSD may lose interest in activities or avoid participating in them. These might be the activities that they enjoyed before the event occurred. <nl><nl>One of the biological changes observed is that the hippocampus is significantly smaller in individuals who develop PTSD. This region of the brain plays a role in memories related to emotion, therefore a smaller hippocampus represents a higher risk for developing PTSD after a traumatic event (Gilbertson 2002). Another biological change that is observed is the failure of the brain centres (e.g ventromedial frontal cortex) which dampens the activation of the brain's fear coordinating centre, the amygdala (Koenigs &amp; Grafman 2009). Therefore, the individual is unable to control the activation of fear after trauma."]}

{"id": "6ebf6b86-d0d0-4160-9399-f2cd3e16b14005115", "discourse_types": ["essay", "speech_transcription"], "pair": ["Aims and Research Questions<nl>The lockdown amidst COVID-19 has made significant disruptions in academic activities. In this lockdown period, it was reported that learners were mostly suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety (42.0%) (Kapasia, N., Paul, P., Roy, A., Saha, J., Zaveri, A., Mallick, R., ... &amp; Chouhan, P. 2020). The negative impact on student mental and physical well-being due to lockdown restrictions, may be seen as detrimental for their academia and overall performance. Other research has been carried out on the wider population, not students specifically, however the COVID-19 lockdown can be seen to affect others negatively, in terms of mental health. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderatesevere insomnia (Gualano, M. R., Lo Moro, G., Voglino, G., Bert, F., &amp; Siliquini, R. 2020). However, research on the wider student experience during COVID-19 in the UK lacks exposure, so the given indication to the gap, conducting this research could be beneficial to raise greater awareness to the subject.<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as the chosen method<nl>IPA is concerned with lived experience. Experience covers quite a lot of territory (Cooper, H. E., Camic, P. M., Long, D. L., Panter, A. T., Rindskopf, D. E., &amp; Sher, K. J. 2012). Furthermore, IPA focuses on the detailed examination of particulars, first providing an in-depth account of each case before moving to look for patterning\u2019s of convergence and divergence across cases (Eatough, V., &amp; Smith, J. A. 2008).  This method allows the researcher to analyse and understand an individual\u2019s experience towards a certain event \u2013 which in this case would be the global pandemic and how it has affected students: it allows us to explore different aspects that may have been impacted and gives us the chance to begin to comprehend those experiences. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>1. \"Feels like a waste of a university experience\"; a student who has been affected by the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>Missing out on experiences and opportunities as a university student, is a main theme in this account - which includes spending time with friends, enjoying the nightlife, parties and academic events (e.g. lectures and seminars). Natasha draws up on the fact that the university experience she is currently having is very different to what she had prior to the COVID-19 restrictions in her first year. Although, she highlights that she had been able to enjoy some of the perks of being a student in her first year of study, she emphasises the lack of it now and realises that she had taken for granted some of the opportunities she had in first year, as she states - \"I definitely should have taken those erm (.) opportunities and just spend it with the people I like being around\". This may highlight the idea that Natasha feels regret because certain experiences are not as readily available as they were before.<nl>1.1 \"I\u2019m not seeing my friends as often as I would do... I\u2019m not going out\": the negatives highlighted due to the lockdown. <nl>Natasha was asked to compare her first year to her current year of university, and the main focus had been that there is a lack of opportunity to go out with friends - to restaurants, clubs and parties: all of which have been impacted significantly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. Further down in the interview she once again emphasises the fact that she yearns for a greater chance to go out to social events: \"I really do miss going out with them and seeing them and spending time with them\". It may suggest that Natasha, who is already limited by the distance from university to her hometown and who may have relied on interaction from social events at university, has been severely impacted and may go on to feel \"lonely\" within these circumstances, as she had previously mentioned when asked who she was able to communicate with at the moment. <nl><nl>There is no doubt that one of the main disadvantages Natasha focuses on is the idea that her personality is hindered by the lockdown: \"there is a lot of downsides...one of the things I love the most like going out, seeing my friends\", she draws attention to this significant piece missing in her life and emphasises how much she enjoys going out and seeing my friends by using the word \"love\". Due to the restrictions there may be an imbalance of work and leisure, Natasha may feel as though she is trapped in unhappiness during this global pandemic. <nl>1.2 \"...I\u2019ve not met anyone new on my course which is a bit upsetting\": the lack of engagement due to face-to-face teaching being moved online. <nl>When Natasha was asked: \"How they get along with engaging with other students\" - the response steered in a direction where she expressed a disappointment in the lack of opportunity to meet new course mates. She stated this a couple of times whilst answering this question: \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\", which may indicate that she has been deeply affected by the fact that the opportunity to engage with other students has been stripped away.<nl>University can be advertised amongst students as being a place where there is a chance to meet many different people - however, the outlook has changed significantly as those opportunities have been limited due to the restrictions; \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\" - Natasha emphasises that university no longer serves the purpose of networking and meeting new people because of social distancing.<nl><nl>2.0 \"...detached mentally from my studies\": recognising the lack of motivation.<nl>Main theme in this segment is how Natasha highlights the depletion of her mental well-being towards her studies and daily life. The lack of face-to-face teaching seems to be the reason for this, as further down the interview she mentions - \"I don\u2019t feel like a uni student (.) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m mentally there so my motivation has decreased signi-significantly\" which further supports the idea that the restrictions are detrimental to university students - due to the vast amount of lectures being moved online. This mentality and decrease of motivation may indicate a severe impact towards Natasha\u2019s mental health and well-being during this period of time. However, this could also be catastrophic for her university grades, as the lack of motivation may hinder the quality of her work and may lead her to underachieve. <nl><nl>2.1 \"...my mind is always in autopilot\": there is a lack of conscious control. <nl>Natasha goes on to use this phrase to describe her consciousness during the days in lockdown. This may emphasise the idea that her time spent in lockdown is constant and uneventful leading her to lose conscious awareness of what she is doing. The use of the word \"autopilot\" underlines the fact that she is aware that she is mentally detached from her life due to the sudden societal changes from the virus. On the other hand, it can be implied that she is comparing herself to that of a machine - where she is constantly stuck in a pattern doing the same thing daily.<nl>She goes on to mention that her \"days kinda merge into one\"- and further explains that she finds it easy to \"lose track\" of what she is doing and what she \"should be doing\",  which may lead to imply that lockdown has had both mental and physical obstacles, that Natasha has encountered and finds it difficult to plan her days and keep to a schedule. The use of the strong verb \"merge\" accentuates the difficulty Natasha is having to distinguish the days as they go by, possibly creating a blurred sense of reality whilst living with the restrictions.<nl><nl>2.2 \"spend the whole day in bed and its really taking a toll on me mentally\": is showing traits of a mental health disorder due to the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>When Natasha was asked how her daily life had changed, she proceeded to emphasise that the gym after the first lockdown, had allowed her to make progress \"mentally and physically\". However, the gyms were forced to close again following the second national lockdown. This proved to be a significant impact for Natasha \u2013 as further down in the answer she stated that she would \"spend the whole day in bed\". This may suggest that she may have been experiencing a mental health related disorder which could have been onset due to the second lockdown. This may portray the risk that the restrictions have towards the well-being of students. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, Natasha has had a wide range of negative changes and experiences whilst being a university student during the global pandemic\u2013 most aspects do relate to the new introduction of social distancing: which has proven to be a big change for her as she thrives of socialising and meeting new people. Natasha who has moved out from their hometown and is now situated in the city where she attends university is likely to feel lonely due to not being around friends or family. The decline in mental health has been evident \u2013 towards both her studies and daily life in general. Natasha finds it hard to live in the present and feels mentally absent on some days. This may indicate that being a student during the global pandemic is detrimental for individuals such as Natasha; leading to unhappiness, loneliness, disappointment, decline in mental health and being unmotivated.

Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent (CI) than the colour congruent (CC) condition. (M= 966.8, SD= 405.1). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( T= 403, n= 59, p= &lt; .001). Data shows that participants took longer to correctly identify the font colours when they were incongruent with the colour of the words written. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>The results that were found were consistent with previous research of Stroop (1935) and supported the hypothesis as participants did have a slower reaction time when identifying incongruent font colours and had a faster reaction time for the congruent condition. The reaction time was faster for the congruent condition because Cattell (1886) argued that wording reading is automatic therefore it\u2019s quicker for individuals to read the word represented to them in that condition. However, different research finding has been reported from a similar stroop task called emotional stroop (Williams et al. 1996). It was found that the emotional Stroop involves only emotional and neutral words and that color does not affect reaction time because it does not conflict with word meaning. The classic stroop test shows that the reaction time is slower because there is a conflict between an incongruent color and the word. Furthermore,  Salthouse and Meinz (1995) argue that even though age differences specific to stroop interference were minimal, other research may show the relationship between age and Stroop interference was still significant (West &amp; Baylis, 1998). <nl><nl>Finally, some of the methodological issues regarding the experiment were that volunteer sampling was used, only university students participated. Findings cannot be generalised to those who did not volunteer and the finding may not be representative of the whole population. An improvement could be made by selecting people of all ages not just university students. Another issue was that the experiment was not completed in a controlled environment, this means they could have had help from others. Another improvement could be that all the participants complete the test in a psychology lab. Also there may have been extraneous variables which may have affected the results, e.g. some participants may have completed at 9am, they would most likely been tired and have had a slower reaction time. This can be improved by making sure all students complete the test at the same time."]}

{"id": "f2341e00-80f0-4778-8e6a-73b16aafd2bc01714", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>This paper will examine whether there is a difference in how males and females use language when in the role of competition judge, and whether the formality of the situation has an impact. This study will focus on the politeness strategies used by each gender when critiquing the contestants. To achieve this, it will investigate the number of lines of speech, the use of positive as opposed to negative adjectives and the use of hedges or intensifiers. A hedge is a linguistic device used to mitigate a statement by lowering epistemic modality and directness with the goal of reducing the threat to face (Salager-Meyer, 1994; Brown and Levinson, 1978.) On the other hand, an intensifier is an adverb or adverbial phrase used to give emphasis (Bolinger, 1972). <nl>The data used in this study is from The Great British Bake Off (which will from here onwards be referred to as GBBO) and MasterChef: The Professionals, which will simply be referred to as MasterChef. These two programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions, but MasterChef features professional chefs and GBBO amateur bakers. There is also a difference in formality as GBBO is more informal and light-hearted which is shown by its two presenters both being comedians. On the other hand, MasterChef is more formal in tone and takes a more serious approach. <nl>This topic has been chosen as it combines politeness theories with gender theory in order to examine how they interact with each other, applying this to a competition environment. Both of the datasets are from television shows therefore it is important to take into account that they may be edited to portray people in a certain way or to best fulfil the main purpose of the shows, which is to entertain. It will be interesting to see how this artificial environment impacts the judges as they may be inclined to be more polite than usual in order to portray themselves well on television, or less polite if their career is based on them playing a \"villain\" role.<nl><nl>Research Background <nl>There has been much debate by linguistics over the relationship between gender and language and the effect the former has on the latter. One of the seminal theorists in this subject is Robin Lakoff (1975) who suggested that there are fundamental differences in how men and women use language. Most relevant to this paper was her identified differences in the use of polite forms, with women typically using more polite forms than men. Janet Holmes (2013) also agreed that women are more likely to use polite forms, although acknowledged that there are differences depending on factors such as the context of the interaction and the specific people involved. She argued that: <nl>\"when all the necessary reservations and qualifications have been taken into account, I think the answer is \u2018yes, women are more polite than men\u2019\" (Holmes, 1995: 5). <nl>It has also been suggested that women use more polite forms as they are more powerless than men (Deuchar, 1988). One theory that supports this is the dominance theory which investigated the number of interruptions between men and women in a mixed gender conversation (Zimmerman and West, 1975). The study found that men are much more likely to interrupt than women and across the eleven conversations they recorded women interrupted only twice whereas men interrupted 46 times. This supports the idea that women are more polite than men, however the study only has a small sample size of 35 participants, all of whom were from a similar background, and is over 45 years old. <nl>Looking more closely at politeness, it can be defined as a type of communication that shows respect and gives some benefit to the other communicators (Leech, 2014). It is an act which aims to maintain the other participants\u2019 positive and negative face (Goffman, 1967). <nl>Leech\u2019s politeness principle (1983) argues that speakers must follow six maxims in order to be considered polite. The theory builds on Grice\u2019s maxims of conversation (1975) but expands these maxim\u2019s and focuses them specifically on appearing polite. These maxims of politeness are; tact, generosity, approbation, modesty and agreement. This study will focus on the maxim of approbation, which involves maximising expressions of praise and approval and lessening the expressions of dispraise. <nl>In a recent study, these maxims were applied to high school students and their interactions with teachers in order to investigate how gender influences politeness (Ningsih et al., 2020). The study used a qualitive approach and gathered data through observations and recordings. They found that both male and female students adhered to the politeness principle more strongly with female teachers than with male teachers. This could suggest that how polite a speaker is depends on the gender of the person they are speaking to more than their own gender identification. Although this study looks only at the speaker and does not take into account the gender of the addressee, this could account for some of the patterns of politeness encountered and therefore is worth taking into consideration. <nl>Looking at this previous research, it could be expected that the female judges in this study will show more behaviours associated with politeness than the male judges, which will be shown through an increase of positive adjectives and a decrease of negative adjectives. It is also expected that the female judges will more often seek to minimise the amount of dispraise given and use hedges to save the hearer\u2019s positive face, whilst using more intensifiers to emphasise praise. It is also anticipated that males will dominate the conversation more, which could be seen as impolite as they allow less room in the conversation for the female judges to speak.<nl><nl>Methodology <nl>The data used in this investigation is from the final episode of the 2020 series of GBBO and the 2020 final of MasterChef. In each episode there are three contestants remaining and so, by using the first challenge they are given in each, there are three sets of comparable data for each show. Each judgement was then transcribed using the key in appendix one. The narration in MasterChef was excluded from the transcripts as it was edited in later and therefore was not part of the conversation being analysed. This analysis only focused on the judge\u2019s communication; however, the contestants and presenter\u2019s speech were included in the transcriptions for context. <nl>These programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions and so the type of praisecriticism given is comparable. However, the difference in tone and level of formality between the programmes allows a deeper investigation into the impact of context on politeness. It will be of interest to see whether the hypothesises are realised and whether the tone and formality of each programme impacts this, and if so to what extent. These programmes were also chosen as they have mixed gender judging panels thus the impact of gender can be observed. <nl>Once the data had been collected, it was analysed using a quantitative approach. The number of lines of speech by each of the judges was counted in each extract and placed into table one. In MasterChef there were three judges, two of which were male. In order to calculate the number of lines of speech for the males, the number for each judge was added together and then divided by two. Although this removes the influence of the individual, which is a disadvantage, it allows the proportion of speech by each gender to be directly compared, which for the purposes of this investigation was deemed more important. <nl>When counting the lines of speech, each line was counted as a whole regardless of the length. However, there is one result which contains a half due to the calculation used to find the average. Speech was also counted as one line if it was transcribed across two due to interruption but the utterance carried on unbroken. <nl>The use of adjectives was also counted and placed into a table (table two) and the context of the utterance was used to determine whether an adjective was used positively as praise, or negatively to criticise. The same method was then applied to the use of hedges and intensifiers, which were then discussed in a qualitative light to determine the effect they had on the overall politeness of each statement.<nl><nl>Findings <nl>i. Amount of speech by male and female judges <nl>The following table summarises the number of lines of speech made by male and female judges in each dataset. As there were two male judges in MasterChef the average number of lines of speech made between them has been used, as mentioned in the methodology. <nl><table><nl>Looking at GBBO first, on average the male judge (Paul) utters more lines of speech than the female judge (Prue). In the judgements of contestants one and three, Paul utters eight lines of speech as opposed to Prue\u2019s six lines, an increase of 28.57%. This is befitting the hypothesis that the male judge will speak more than the female judge, however the data featuring contestant two conflicts with this. In this instance, Prue has one more line of speech than Paul which is a 22.22% difference. Overall, Paul speaks more than Prue in two of the three extracts, and in there is a greater difference between the judges when Paul is the one speaking more. Across all three extracts Paul is shown to utter 16.22% more lines of speech than Prue, conforming to the expected results. <nl>Analysing the MasterChef results, the males (Gregg and Marcus) utter more lines of speech in the judgements of contestants one and two than the female judge (Monica). In the transcript featuring contestant one there is a 40% difference in the number of utterances, and in the next there is a 22.22% difference. This is a greater increase in the amount of speech by males as opposed to females than was seen in GBBO. Yet, when the judgement of contestant three is analysed, the largest difference in speech of all the transcripts is shown with Monica speaking 66.67% more lines than the male judges. This means that overall, there is only a 3.39% difference between the male and female judges, with the female judge having uttered more lines in total. This disagrees with the hypothesis that men would talk more but the difference in utterance of lines is minimal. <nl>To conclude, the data from GBBO is in accordance with the hypothesis made that males will utter more lines of speech than females, but the data from MasterChef contradicts it. There are a few possible explanations for why this might have occurred. One explanation is the difference in tone between the two shows; In MasterChef the setting is more formal and professional whereas GBBO is a more informal setting where the judges interact with the contestants more colloquially. Therefore, GBBO mirrors normal conversations more than MasterChef and the context relates more closely to that of the studies researched for this paper. There is also a difference in the way the programmes are formatted. The judgement in GBBO is more like a conversation in the first challenge, so there are examples of turn-taking within the conversation. In contrast, on MasterChef the judges speak one at a time in longer instances and there are no conversations between them. This could influence the results as it means the participants are not dominating the conversation but rather giving a longer individual monologue. <nl>It is also of note that the extracts transcribed are only a couple of minutes long and therefore there is only a relatively small amount of data. In a longer conversation there is a possibility that the difference between male and female speech could become more defined.<nl><nl>ii. Use of adjectives <nl>When categorising the use of adjectives into positive or negative classifications, the context of the sentence was used to determine what category was most appropriate. They were then collated into the table below. <nl><table><nl>For example, \"wobbly\" was classed as a positive adjective as it was used in the utterance \"I like the wobbly lines\" (Appendix three, lines 20-22). <nl>Analysing the use of adjectives by the GBBO judges, Prue used more positive adjectives with each contestant as well as a greater range of adjectives. Looking at the use of negative adjectives, both judges used a similar number however Paul used one more. Therefore, the GBBO data aligns with the hypothesis that the female judge would use more adjectives that signal praise, and the male more negative adjectives. <nl>When comparing this to the results for the MasterChef data, Monica used an equal number of negative adjectives as Marcus, and one more than Gregg who did not use any. This contradicts the hypothesis and suggests that Monica is more willing to risk threatening the contestants face than Gregg, who only uses compliments. When judging the first contestant, Gregg used seven times as many adjectives to give praise than Monica did, and more than twice as many as Marcus. With the next contestant all three judges used the same number of positive adjectives and with the final contestant Monica used the most; using four times as many as Gregg and twice as many as Marcus. Ranking the judges based on their use of positive minus negative adjectives, Marcus and Monica both ranked the same and Gregg ranked highest meaning he is most concerned with politeness and least willing to flout the maxim of approbation. In summary, the data from MasterChef does not support the hypothesis and contrasts with the GBBO results. <nl><nl>iii. Use of hedges and intensifiers <nl>Within this table a colour-coding system has been using to differentiate between the hedges and intensifiers that have been used in relation to negative statements, and those that have been used positively. Text in green represents the words and phrases that have be used in relation to praise, and red has been used for text that relates to dispraise or criticism. <nl><table><nl>The intensifier \"very very\" was kept as one phrase within the table rather than two instances of the word \"very\" to emphasise how strongly the praise was given. <nl>The results from the analysis on hedging and intensifiers is similar to the patterns seen when investigating the use of adjectives. In the GBBO data, Prue used more positively associated hedges and intensifiers and fewer negative ones than Paul. <nl>Similarly, in the MasterChef data Gregg did not use any negative forms of these linguistic features which correlates with his use of adjectives. Although Marcus used more negative forms of the features than Monica, he also used more positive forms therefore showing they have an equal level of politeness as shown with their use of adjectives. <nl>Overall, this section again confirms that the judges in GBBO conform to the ideas of gender and politeness, whereas the judges in MasterChef do not. This could be down to the individual\u2019s character, as the social constructivist theory suggests that gender is only one part of our identity that influences communication; Personality, status, level of education and ethnicity also all serve to shape our communication (Burr, 2015). It suggests that people make each element of this construction relevant or irrelevant as is necessary. This suggests that Monica and Gregg could be choosing not to make their gender relevant to their role as judge, and each is relying on other factors to influence their use of praise instead. <nl><nl>Discussion <nl>One section that is particularly interesting is where Paul and Prue discussed the issues with Dave\u2019s custard slice in the GGBO. In the extract below, both judges use a mixture of hedges and praise to try and soften their criticism of Dave and minimise their flouting of the maxim of approbation. <nl><data_extract><nl>In cooking the adjective \"strong\" can be both positive or negative. In this extract Prue signals that she is using it positively by her use of the phrase \"I love the coffee\" before describing it as strong, thereby using it to praise Dave. The use of the intensifier \"really\" emphasises the strength of the flavour which adds to this praise. This extract also features the word \"stodgy\" three times. In the first instance, Paul used it to criticise Dave\u2019s custard which is an example of a positive face threatening act. However, Paul lessens the impact of the criticism by using the hedging phrase \"a little bit\" therefore minimising the expression of dispraise as laid out in Leech\u2019s maxim of approbation (1983). Prue then repeats this criticism however she uses the adjective \"stodgy\" twice with an emphasis on the first time. In this instance she is using the first expression of stodgy as a hedge to minimise the impact of the second expression, hereby implying it is not as bad as it could be and is only minorly stodgy. Again, this helps to minimise the impoliteness and helps to save face. \"Pretty\" is also used as a hedge in this extract, which lessens the compliment of it being \"delicious\". The use of the adverb \"still\" serves to further lessen it, so although Prue is paying a compliment, she is still acknowledging that the baking has flaws. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, the hypothesises that female judges would use more language concerned with politeness were realised to a certain extent. The patterns of communication shown by the GBBO judges did match up with what was expected, however the judges in MasterChef conformed to these expectations to a much lesser extent. This could be due to the formality of the show as opposed to the more colloquial nature of The Great British Bake Off, although it could also be due to the individual backgrounds and personalities of each judge. There is also a possibility that the gender of the contestant being judged has an impact on how the judges use politeness. Future research could investigate further by looking at a greater range of programmes and including more data for each. There is also an age difference of 35 years between the two female judges so it could be interesting to investigate deeper into how the changes in society between these years have influenced how women use language in reference to politeness.", "Hi <addr3_FN>, <nl><nl><nl>I made a few minor changes, let me know what you think.

{"id": "062e1250-39c4-443f-a293-29b60bd7e87000813", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Abstract <nl>The Stroop effect was introduced by John Ridley Stroop in 1935, the task works by examining the response time of the participant to name colors of words presented to them. Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent (CI) than the colour congruent (CC) condition. (M= 966.8, SD= 405.1). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( T= 403, n= 59, p= &lt; .001). Data shows that participants took longer to correctly identify the font colours when they were incongruent with the colour of the words written. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>The results that were found were consistent with previous research of Stroop (1935) and supported the hypothesis as participants did have a slower reaction time when identifying incongruent font colours and had a faster reaction time for the congruent condition. The reaction time was faster for the congruent condition because Cattell (1886) argued that wording reading is automatic therefore it\u2019s quicker for individuals to read the word represented to them in that condition. However, different research finding has been reported from a similar stroop task called emotional stroop (Williams et al. 1996). It was found that the emotional Stroop involves only emotional and neutral words and that color does not affect reaction time because it does not conflict with word meaning. The classic stroop test shows that the reaction time is slower because there is a conflict between an incongruent color and the word. Furthermore,  Salthouse and Meinz (1995) argue that even though age differences specific to stroop interference were minimal, other research may show the relationship between age and Stroop interference was still significant (West &amp; Baylis, 1998). <nl><nl>Finally, some of the methodological issues regarding the experiment were that volunteer sampling was used, only university students participated. Findings cannot be generalised to those who did not volunteer and the finding may not be representative of the whole population. An improvement could be made by selecting people of all ages not just university students. Another issue was that the experiment was not completed in a controlled environment, this means they could have had help from others. Another improvement could be that all the participants complete the test in a psychology lab. Also there may have been extraneous variables which may have affected the results, e.g. some participants may have completed at 9am, they would most likely been tired and have had a slower reaction time. This can be improved by making sure all students complete the test at the same time.", "Hi,<nl>I still have not received my order which is very frustrating.

Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001).", "Hi, <nl><nl>I have completed all the tasks. <nl><nl>AGE: <age><nl>DOB: &lt;DDMMYYYY&gt;<nl>Handedness (left or right): right<new>Hi <addr10_FN>, <nl><nl>I am a second-year student, and I am currently doing my transcript for the project due next week.

In this lockdown period, it was reported that learners were mostly suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety (42.0%) (Kapasia, N., Paul, P., Roy, A., Saha, J., Zaveri, A., Mallick, R., ... &amp; Chouhan, P. 2020). The negative impact on student mental and physical well-being due to lockdown restrictions, may be seen as detrimental for their academia and overall performance. Other research has been carried out on the wider population, not students specifically, however the COVID-19 lockdown can be seen to affect others negatively, in terms of mental health. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderatesevere insomnia (Gualano, M. R., Lo Moro, G., Voglino, G., Bert, F., &amp; Siliquini, R. 2020). However, research on the wider student experience during COVID-19 in the UK lacks exposure, so the given indication to the gap, conducting this research could be beneficial to raise greater awareness to the subject.<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as the chosen method<nl>IPA is concerned with lived experience. Experience covers quite a lot of territory (Cooper, H. E., Camic, P. M., Long, D. L., Panter, A. T., Rindskopf, D. E., &amp; Sher, K. J. 2012). Furthermore, IPA focuses on the detailed examination of particulars, first providing an in-depth account of each case before moving to look for patterning\u2019s of convergence and divergence across cases (Eatough, V., &amp; Smith, J. A. 2008).  This method allows the researcher to analyse and understand an individual\u2019s experience towards a certain event \u2013 which in this case would be the global pandemic and how it has affected students: it allows us to explore different aspects that may have been impacted and gives us the chance to begin to comprehend those experiences. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>1. \"Feels like a waste of a university experience\"; a student who has been affected by the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>Missing out on experiences and opportunities as a university student, is a main theme in this account - which includes spending time with friends, enjoying the nightlife, parties and academic events (e.g. lectures and seminars). Natasha draws up on the fact that the university experience she is currently having is very different to what she had prior to the COVID-19 restrictions in her first year. Although, she highlights that she had been able to enjoy some of the perks of being a student in her first year of study, she emphasises the lack of it now and realises that she had taken for granted some of the opportunities she had in first year, as she states - \"I definitely should have taken those erm (.) opportunities and just spend it with the people I like being around\". This may highlight the idea that Natasha feels regret because certain experiences are not as readily available as they were before.<nl>1.1 \"I\u2019m not seeing my friends as often as I would do... I\u2019m not going out\": the negatives highlighted due to the lockdown. <nl>Natasha was asked to compare her first year to her current year of university, and the main focus had been that there is a lack of opportunity to go out with friends - to restaurants, clubs and parties: all of which have been impacted significantly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. Further down in the interview she once again emphasises the fact that she yearns for a greater chance to go out to social events: \"I really do miss going out with them and seeing them and spending time with them\". It may suggest that Natasha, who is already limited by the distance from university to her hometown and who may have relied on interaction from social events at university, has been severely impacted and may go on to feel \"lonely\" within these circumstances, as she had previously mentioned when asked who she was able to communicate with at the moment. <nl><nl>There is no doubt that one of the main disadvantages Natasha focuses on is the idea that her personality is hindered by the lockdown: \"there is a lot of downsides...one of the things I love the most like going out, seeing my friends\", she draws attention to this significant piece missing in her life and emphasises how much she enjoys going out and seeing my friends by using the word \"love\". Due to the restrictions there may be an imbalance of work and leisure, Natasha may feel as though she is trapped in unhappiness during this global pandemic. <nl>1.2 \"...I\u2019ve not met anyone new on my course which is a bit upsetting\": the lack of engagement due to face-to-face teaching being moved online. <nl>When Natasha was asked: \"How they get along with engaging with other students\" - the response steered in a direction where she expressed a disappointment in the lack of opportunity to meet new course mates. She stated this a couple of times whilst answering this question: \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\", which may indicate that she has been deeply affected by the fact that the opportunity to engage with other students has been stripped away.<nl>University can be advertised amongst students as being a place where there is a chance to meet many different people - however, the outlook has changed significantly as those opportunities have been limited due to the restrictions; \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\" - Natasha emphasises that university no longer serves the purpose of networking and meeting new people because of social distancing.<nl><nl>2.0 \"...detached mentally from my studies\": recognising the lack of motivation.<nl>Main theme in this segment is how Natasha highlights the depletion of her mental well-being towards her studies and daily life. The lack of face-to-face teaching seems to be the reason for this, as further down the interview she mentions - \"I don\u2019t feel like a uni student (.) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m mentally there so my motivation has decreased signi-significantly\" which further supports the idea that the restrictions are detrimental to university students - due to the vast amount of lectures being moved online. This mentality and decrease of motivation may indicate a severe impact towards Natasha\u2019s mental health and well-being during this period of time. However, this could also be catastrophic for her university grades, as the lack of motivation may hinder the quality of her work and may lead her to underachieve. <nl><nl>2.1 \"...my mind is always in autopilot\": there is a lack of conscious control. <nl>Natasha goes on to use this phrase to describe her consciousness during the days in lockdown. This may emphasise the idea that her time spent in lockdown is constant and uneventful leading her to lose conscious awareness of what she is doing. The use of the word \"autopilot\" underlines the fact that she is aware that she is mentally detached from her life due to the sudden societal changes from the virus. On the other hand, it can be implied that she is comparing herself to that of a machine - where she is constantly stuck in a pattern doing the same thing daily.<nl>She goes on to mention that her \"days kinda merge into one\"- and further explains that she finds it easy to \"lose track\" of what she is doing and what she \"should be doing\",  which may lead to imply that lockdown has had both mental and physical obstacles, that Natasha has encountered and finds it difficult to plan her days and keep to a schedule. The use of the strong verb \"merge\" accentuates the difficulty Natasha is having to distinguish the days as they go by, possibly creating a blurred sense of reality whilst living with the restrictions.<nl><nl>2.2 \"spend the whole day in bed and its really taking a toll on me mentally\": is showing traits of a mental health disorder due to the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>When Natasha was asked how her daily life had changed, she proceeded to emphasise that the gym after the first lockdown, had allowed her to make progress \"mentally and physically\". However, the gyms were forced to close again following the second national lockdown. This proved to be a significant impact for Natasha \u2013 as further down in the answer she stated that she would \"spend the whole day in bed\". This may suggest that she may have been experiencing a mental health related disorder which could have been onset due to the second lockdown. This may portray the risk that the restrictions have towards the well-being of students. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, Natasha has had a wide range of negative changes and experiences whilst being a university student during the global pandemic\u2013 most aspects do relate to the new introduction of social distancing: which has proven to be a big change for her as she thrives of socialising and meeting new people. Natasha who has moved out from their hometown and is now situated in the city where she attends university is likely to feel lonely due to not being around friends or family. The decline in mental health has been evident \u2013 towards both her studies and daily life in general. Natasha finds it hard to live in the present and feels mentally absent on some days. This may indicate that being a student during the global pandemic is detrimental for individuals such as Natasha; leading to unhappiness, loneliness, disappointment, decline in mental health and being unmotivated.

I think, obviously, since we\u2019ve been in and out of lockdown, erm, I\u2019ve joined the gym. Like I have u-, I used to go to the gym but, erm, not that often. Erm, so, when I joined the gym, I started eating a lot more just because I\u2019m trying to put weight on, \u2018cause, obviously, I, I\u2019ve always had around two big meals a day or like, erm, two, three small meals a day.

Erm, but it\u2019s like a huge, green, like spikey kind of melon looking thing but, obviously, when you cut inside of it, then there\u2019s like a huge, strong smell of like rotting like, rotten fruit, basically. But it has a really, really sweet taste, which is really strange. Erm, I tasted some at my friend\u2019s house one time and I could never forget about it, honestly.

This might include an increase in negative emotions and the inability to experience positive ones. For instance, if a woman was sexually abused, she might experience anxiety or fear even after her abuse. A second cognitive change might be a severe lack of interest in activities. The women might have enjoyed spending time with her friends prior to her abuse but after the abuse she might resist and avoid any involvement in activities that were once pleasurable to her. She may also blame herself for getting sexually abused. Her choice of wearing a scandalous outfit might justify why someone abused her and this would be another cognitive change.<nl><nl>There are also biological changes associated with PTSD. The amygdala is responsible for the perception of emotions and the ventromedial frontal cortex is responsible for regulating responses to emotions. However, the frontal region with those who have PTSD does not function effectively and it does not dampen down the amygdala to the same degree as it does with people without the disorder. Another biological change may be a decrease in the size of the hippocampus, and this might explain why people with PTSD have difficulties consolidating their memories.<nl><nl><nl>Question 2: Outline the proposed role of operant conditioning in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).  How would a behavioural therapist treat OCD? (Both parts of this question are equally weighted). <nl><nl>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is made up of two components, obsessions and compulsions. The compulsion refers to the repetitive behaviour, for example, suffers may regularly wash their hands to reduce anxiety. The anxiety is caused by obsessive, irrational thoughts for example, the constant fear of germs and bacteria. According to the second stage of Mowrer\u2019s (1947) two stage theory, the removal of an aversive stimulus will negatively reinforce behaviour. In other words, the removal of anxiety is caused by the compulsive acts of washing hands \u2013 negative reinforcement and the relief from the anxiety might be rewarding to a sufferer \u2013 positive reinforcement. Thus, the behaviour will perpetuate because it is both negatively and positively reinforced.<nl><nl>Behavioural therapists treat OCD using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT involves the therapist and sufferer to actively break down and challenge irrational thoughts and behaviours through exposure and response prevention (ERP). This involves the gradual exposure to the feared object, this might be a fear of dirt and individuals are counter conditioned to learn new ways to control their compulsive behaviours around the fear. Once the fear is mastered, they will adopt these changes into their daily routine and try overcome their disorder.<nl><nl>Section B<nl>Critically evaluate the concept of dependence as an explanation for substance use.<nl>Dependence is an explanation for substance use and it refers to the need for drugs in order to function and in absence of the drugs, individuals may display withdrawal symptoms. There are two types of dependence, physical and mental. Mental dependence is when the use of a substance leads to a conditioned response to an emotion or feeling. For example, someone suffering from depression might rely heavily on benzodiazepines to evoke positive emotions such as relaxation and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, this could lead to drug misuse and the dependence explanation has helped lead to practical applications to avoid this occurring. For instance, doctors will prescribe benzodiazepines only in serious cases and for less than 4 weeks to avoid dependencyaddiction. This explanation has led to a greater understanding about drugs and positive social changes.<nl><nl>The dependence explanation is limited however, because substance use could also be a result of genetic predispositions. Kendler &amp; Prescott (1998) support this notion through their research on 1,934 twins, ranging in age from 22 to 62. They were given interviews about their drug addictions to cocaine and marijuana. Kendler reported that whilst examining pairs, it was evident that the concordance rates for both twins using drugs was higher in monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ) twins. The concordance rate for cocaine use in MZ twins was 54% and in DZ twins it was 42%. Thus, this gives weight to the influence of genetics on substance use. While it is important to understand the role of heredity on substance use, environmental factors are also as important. These factors may include stress, trauma, or community pressure. Exposure to trauma has been linked closely to substance use. Witnessing death or experiencing assault would be a traumatic experience and these people are more likely to take drugs. This may be because trauma symptoms may become more manageable after self-medicating. Turning to drugs may be the easier escape for some individuals when dealing with environmental difficulties. Thus, substance use may be a result of genetic and environmental factors interacting so therefore, a diathesis stress model should be proposed.<nl><nl>Behaviourists stress the important role operant conditioning has on behaviour. Operant conditioning as proposed by Skinner (1938) can be applied to substance use. For instance, people suffering from trauma may use drugs as a coping mechanism to alleviate their trauma related symptoms (this might include shocks and mood swings). Skinner referred to negative reinforcement as the continual of behaviour to remove any aversive outcomes. Similarly, individuals might repeat the act of taking drugs because it temporarily removes their symptoms. Another concept of operant conditioning is positive reinforcement. This refers to the continual of behaviour to gain a reward. Drugs are involved in the activation of dopamine pathways. These pathways stimulate pleasure and reward thus might also explain why people continue to take drugs. Therefore, the dependent explanation can not alone explain substance use as a variety of factors and explanations might account for it.", "Dear Dr. <addr11_SN> <nl><nl>I am a second year <course> who is seeking to be transferred over to the degree program including the placement year as I am not currently on it.

Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent (CI) than the colour congruent (CC) condition. (M= 966.8, SD= 405.1). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( T= 403, n= 59, p= &lt; .001). Data shows that participants took longer to correctly identify the font colours when they were incongruent with the colour of the words written. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>The results that were found were consistent with previous research of Stroop (1935) and supported the hypothesis as participants did have a slower reaction time when identifying incongruent font colours and had a faster reaction time for the congruent condition. The reaction time was faster for the congruent condition because Cattell (1886) argued that wording reading is automatic therefore it\u2019s quicker for individuals to read the word represented to them in that condition. However, different research finding has been reported from a similar stroop task called emotional stroop (Williams et al. 1996). It was found that the emotional Stroop involves only emotional and neutral words and that color does not affect reaction time because it does not conflict with word meaning. The classic stroop test shows that the reaction time is slower because there is a conflict between an incongruent color and the word. Furthermore,  Salthouse and Meinz (1995) argue that even though age differences specific to stroop interference were minimal, other research may show the relationship between age and Stroop interference was still significant (West &amp; Baylis, 1998). <nl><nl>Finally, some of the methodological issues regarding the experiment were that volunteer sampling was used, only university students participated. Findings cannot be generalised to those who did not volunteer and the finding may not be representative of the whole population. An improvement could be made by selecting people of all ages not just university students. Another issue was that the experiment was not completed in a controlled environment, this means they could have had help from others. Another improvement could be that all the participants complete the test in a psychology lab. Also there may have been extraneous variables which may have affected the results, e.g. some participants may have completed at 9am, they would most likely been tired and have had a slower reaction time. This can be improved by making sure all students complete the test at the same time.", "Hi, <nl>my number is <phone_number><new>Hi <addr11_FN>, <nl>I am <part_FN_SN> from your tutorial group, this is my email. <nl><nl>Kind regards, <nl><part_FN><new>Hi Dr <addr3_SN>, <nl>I am <part_FN_SN> (<student_number>), first year <course> student and I wanted to contact you regarding my exam result.

And the-the brown boy is looking at an Apple Mac which is on- sitting on a table, and they look like they\u2019re in a-a university maybe environment, they\u2019re probably studying. And yeah, they\u2019re probably studying. The last image, image number three, is of a male and a female, and they\u2019re sitting next to each other. The male is holding a book; again they look like they\u2019re studying. And there\u2019s like someone who is not in the image and they are both looking at that person. And I feel like they\u2019re probably explaining something, probably to do with work, or something related. They\u2019re probably having a conversation and they-they look like they\u2019re really enjoying it because they have like very big smiles on their face. That\u2019s all.", " Yeah. So, erm, I\u2019ll typically, like if I wake up early, I wouldn\u2019t have breakfast straight away. So, I\u2019d probably, erm, wait til around elevenish to have my breakfast so, just so I can be full for longer. So, erm, in the morning, er, when I have my breakfast, I would have a toast with peanut butter and, erm, half of a banana. Erm, then I would, er, either like put some honey on top or some walnuts, erm, some sort of healthy fats. And then I would also have, erm, one, er, balcony cake, I don\u2019t know what they\u2019re  <unintelligible>  balcony cakes, the small ones. And then I\u2019d have green tea as well with it. Then that would be my, erm, breakfast. It depends, sometimes I\u2019d have one, sometimes I\u2019d have two, it just depends how I\u2019m feeling on that day. And then I would have, erm, lunch. Lunch, erm, it can be anything like, er, whatever is cooked in the house so  <unintelligible>  whatever  <unintelligible>  so that could be pasta and lasagne, erm. Where I\u2019m from, what they, they will cook like  <unintelligible>  not really cook where I\u2019m from. So, erm, like  <unintelligible>  pilau, like different, different, erm, stuff  <laugh> . Yeah.<new>I think, er, lunch and dinner, 'cause they have a lot, like  <unintelligible>  'cause I don\u2019t have that much. And then, er, I try to like keep all of like, 'cause I\u2019m trying to like, you know, those kind of  <unintelligible> . So, before I was a little bit chubbier so I tried to lose a lot of weight.

So, trying to be like, erm, within calories so, erm, er, breakfast, I don\u2019t have much. And then dinner and then just so I can be full, erm, yeah, I have both.<new>Erm, I don\u2019t know why but I like, like, carbohydrates, like pasta and lasagne, like anything like, yeah, carbohydrates, I don\u2019t know.

It is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued left than when cued right. Data from 38 participants was used. Within-subjects design. Independent variable had two levels: cue left, cue right. Dependant variable was the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V). EEG electrodes were attached to relevant areas using the 1020 system. The results showed that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions. The results are consistent with the hypothesis and previous research.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>The alpha inhibition hypothesis refers to the concept that high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha wave in the relaxation state has higher power spectrum than in the attention state. Yaomanee, K., Pan-ngum, S., &amp; Ayuthaya, P. I. N. (2012). Concluding that alpha activity can be modulated by attention, thus meaning that alpha activity is reduced when we pay attention to stimuli.<nl>This experiment is a partial replication of Sauseng et al., (2005). Overall, 22 participants used, and they were given a cued visual attention task. Cued with a fixation cross for 34ms, then an arrow cue would indicate which hemifield a target would appear in. There was a 50% chance of being cued left or right, 75% of the trials were valid and 25% of trials were invalid. Results indicated that parietal regions showed stronger alpha lower band frequency suppression contralateral to the attended hemifield. Similar results for upper frequencies. Therefore, the alpha inhibition hypothesis is supported by these findings as there is stronger alpha activity in the task irrelevant brain areas. <nl>To further support these findings, Mazahari et al., (2014) used 57 adolescent participants: 23 normally developing, 17 who have combined subtype ADHD (inattention and hyperactivity) and 17 who have predominantly inattentive ADHD. Used a cued flanker task. Response preparation cue predicted 84% accuracy, or a null cue was shown which had no information about correct response. Overall participants showed alpha suppression following response preparation cues, greater for normally developing participants and least for inattentive ADHD subtypes. The indicative alpha suppression supports the idea that alpha activity can be modulated by attention \u2013 thus being reduced when participants attended to the stimuli.<nl>Following on previous studies, it is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued to expect a stimulus on the left than when cued to expect a stimulus on the right, when recording from the left parietal lobe (P3).  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>To begin with, 39 undergraduate participants were obtained by volunteer sample, however, one participant was removed as they were only available for one of the two conditions: 38 participants overall. <nl>Design <nl>Within subject\u2019s design, with an independent variable of cue direction with two levels: either left or right. The dependent variable is the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V).<nl><nl>Materials <nl>A Biopac MP36 was used to record alpha range activity and receive event markers for cue left and cue right conditions. EEG electrodes which were attached to the head. AC Cream and Everi cream was used, in preparation prior to the attachment of electrodes. The software PsychoPy was used to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. Stimuli were used to present to the visual fields such as: arrow cues left (&lt;) and right (&gt;), large bar (Figure A) and small bar (Figure B) stimuli. <nl><figure><nl> <nl>Procedure <nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz. Digital channels were set up to receive the event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker. A calculation channel was also set up to record the activity in the alpha frequency range of (8 - 13 Hz). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. <nl>Before preparing the participants, they gave informed consent and were briefed on their right to withdraw from the experiment. To prepare the participants for electrode placement, Everi cream was used to abrase the areas P3, Fz and forehead, selected using the 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Techologies, 2012). The AC cream was then applied on the electrodes: an active electrode was attached to P3. Reference electrodes are attached at Fz. Earth electrodes were attached to the forehead, near the hairline. The impedance levels were checked to be below 10Kohms.  <nl>Participants were given instructions and a practice trial first and were cued with an arrow for 35ms to let participants know which side to expect a stimulus, with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) set to 600ms-800ms in the practice trial. Different event markers were sent at stimulus onset for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli consisted of either large or small white bars shown either left or right on the screen on a black background for 50ms. The participants respond with either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. They underwent 12 practice trials including feedback about their response, before undergoing 4 blocks of 20 trials. After the practice trail was complete, the participants were given feedback on their performance.<nl>The participants were shortly warned that the real experiment was about to start. The random ISI was set to 200ms-1200ms<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>To covert the raw 9-13 Hz Alpha EEG to averaged data. Event markers from PsychoPy were sent to identify when stimuli were presented. Then looked at the period 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown. The data was rectified, which turns the negative values into positive, in order to show alpha activity regardless of it being excitatory or inhibitory. Averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of the outlying or extreme values. The rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were then suitable for statistical analysis. <nl>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics<nl>Firstly, to determine whether the data is parametric, a Shapiro-Wilk test was used and p&lt;.005. The p value is less than .05, therefore, a non-parametric equivalent had to be used: <nl>Wilcoxon signed ranks test. <nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions and a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed this difference was significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were consistent with the predicted hypothesis, as the median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left, than cue right and this supports the idea that alpha activity at P3 is different depending on which side participants are cued to expect a stimulus. <nl>The results also support previous research and the alpha inhibition hypothesis, as high alpha shows the inhibition of task irrelevant areas due to more activity in the left hemisphere (Klimesch et al., 2007), on the ipsilateral side of where the cue was presented. <nl>Although the results are consistent with the hypothesis, confounding variables may have altered the data to an extent. The participants moving around, may have altered the validity as gross motor movements may contaminate the EEG recordings, (Bell, M. A., &amp; Cuevas, K., 2012).<nl>Overall, there may be some areas for improvement to prevent confounding variables from affecting the data. To prevent motor movements, the participants should be given strict instructions to follow due to the sensitivity of the EEG. The researchers should monitor the participants to check if those instructions are being followed. However, despite these issues, the results can be granted as valid as the correct procedures were taken during the experiment, such as ensuring the impedance levels were below 10Kohms and in addition the results were expected due to previous research.", "Erm, the first image looks like, erm, two work colleagues, they\u2019re both girls.

Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent (CI) than the colour congruent (CC) condition. (M= 966.8, SD= 405.1). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( T= 403, n= 59, p= &lt; .001). Data shows that participants took longer to correctly identify the font colours when they were incongruent with the colour of the words written. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>The results that were found were consistent with previous research of Stroop (1935) and supported the hypothesis as participants did have a slower reaction time when identifying incongruent font colours and had a faster reaction time for the congruent condition. The reaction time was faster for the congruent condition because Cattell (1886) argued that wording reading is automatic therefore it\u2019s quicker for individuals to read the word represented to them in that condition. However, different research finding has been reported from a similar stroop task called emotional stroop (Williams et al. 1996). It was found that the emotional Stroop involves only emotional and neutral words and that color does not affect reaction time because it does not conflict with word meaning. The classic stroop test shows that the reaction time is slower because there is a conflict between an incongruent color and the word. Furthermore,  Salthouse and Meinz (1995) argue that even though age differences specific to stroop interference were minimal, other research may show the relationship between age and Stroop interference was still significant (West &amp; Baylis, 1998). <nl><nl>Finally, some of the methodological issues regarding the experiment were that volunteer sampling was used, only university students participated. Findings cannot be generalised to those who did not volunteer and the finding may not be representative of the whole population. An improvement could be made by selecting people of all ages not just university students. Another issue was that the experiment was not completed in a controlled environment, this means they could have had help from others. Another improvement could be that all the participants complete the test in a psychology lab. Also there may have been extraneous variables which may have affected the results, e.g. some participants may have completed at 9am, they would most likely been tired and have had a slower reaction time. This can be improved by making sure all students complete the test at the same time."]}

Lastly, another cognitive change that is observed is that the individuals affected by PTSD may lose interest in activities or avoid participating in them. These might be the activities that they enjoyed before the event occurred. <nl><nl>One of the biological changes observed is that the hippocampus is significantly smaller in individuals who develop PTSD. This region of the brain plays a role in memories related to emotion, therefore a smaller hippocampus represents a higher risk for developing PTSD after a traumatic event (Gilbertson 2002). Another biological change that is observed is the failure of the brain centres (e.g ventromedial frontal cortex) which dampens the activation of the brain's fear coordinating centre, the amygdala (Koenigs &amp; Grafman 2009). Therefore, the individual is unable to control the activation of fear after trauma."]}
{"id": "c2f39852-26f9-4a4b-98d5-e251c8e8267501628", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Aims and Research Questions<nl>The lockdown amidst COVID-19 has made significant disruptions in academic activities. In this lockdown period, it was reported that learners were mostly suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety (42.0%) (Kapasia, N., Paul, P., Roy, A., Saha, J., Zaveri, A., Mallick, R., ... &amp; Chouhan, P. 2020). The negative impact on student mental and physical well-being due to lockdown restrictions, may be seen as detrimental for their academia and overall performance. Other research has been carried out on the wider population, not students specifically, however the COVID-19 lockdown can be seen to affect others negatively, in terms of mental health. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderatesevere insomnia (Gualano, M. R., Lo Moro, G., Voglino, G., Bert, F., &amp; Siliquini, R. 2020). However, research on the wider student experience during COVID-19 in the UK lacks exposure, so the given indication to the gap, conducting this research could be beneficial to raise greater awareness to the subject.<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as the chosen method<nl>IPA is concerned with lived experience. Experience covers quite a lot of territory (Cooper, H. E., Camic, P. M., Long, D. L., Panter, A. T., Rindskopf, D. E., &amp; Sher, K. J. 2012). Furthermore, IPA focuses on the detailed examination of particulars, first providing an in-depth account of each case before moving to look for patterning\u2019s of convergence and divergence across cases (Eatough, V., &amp; Smith, J. A. 2008).  This method allows the researcher to analyse and understand an individual\u2019s experience towards a certain event \u2013 which in this case would be the global pandemic and how it has affected students: it allows us to explore different aspects that may have been impacted and gives us the chance to begin to comprehend those experiences. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>1. \"Feels like a waste of a university experience\"; a student who has been affected by the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>Missing out on experiences and opportunities as a university student, is a main theme in this account - which includes spending time with friends, enjoying the nightlife, parties and academic events (e.g. lectures and seminars). Natasha draws up on the fact that the university experience she is currently having is very different to what she had prior to the COVID-19 restrictions in her first year. Although, she highlights that she had been able to enjoy some of the perks of being a student in her first year of study, she emphasises the lack of it now and realises that she had taken for granted some of the opportunities she had in first year, as she states - \"I definitely should have taken those erm (.) opportunities and just spend it with the people I like being around\". This may highlight the idea that Natasha feels regret because certain experiences are not as readily available as they were before.<nl>1.1 \"I\u2019m not seeing my friends as often as I would do... I\u2019m not going out\": the negatives highlighted due to the lockdown. <nl>Natasha was asked to compare her first year to her current year of university, and the main focus had been that there is a lack of opportunity to go out with friends - to restaurants, clubs and parties: all of which have been impacted significantly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. Further down in the interview she once again emphasises the fact that she yearns for a greater chance to go out to social events: \"I really do miss going out with them and seeing them and spending time with them\". It may suggest that Natasha, who is already limited by the distance from university to her hometown and who may have relied on interaction from social events at university, has been severely impacted and may go on to feel \"lonely\" within these circumstances, as she had previously mentioned when asked who she was able to communicate with at the moment. <nl><nl>There is no doubt that one of the main disadvantages Natasha focuses on is the idea that her personality is hindered by the lockdown: \"there is a lot of downsides...one of the things I love the most like going out, seeing my friends\", she draws attention to this significant piece missing in her life and emphasises how much she enjoys going out and seeing my friends by using the word \"love\". Due to the restrictions there may be an imbalance of work and leisure, Natasha may feel as though she is trapped in unhappiness during this global pandemic. <nl>1.2 \"...I\u2019ve not met anyone new on my course which is a bit upsetting\": the lack of engagement due to face-to-face teaching being moved online. <nl>When Natasha was asked: \"How they get along with engaging with other students\" - the response steered in a direction where she expressed a disappointment in the lack of opportunity to meet new course mates. She stated this a couple of times whilst answering this question: \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\", which may indicate that she has been deeply affected by the fact that the opportunity to engage with other students has been stripped away.<nl>University can be advertised amongst students as being a place where there is a chance to meet many different people - however, the outlook has changed significantly as those opportunities have been limited due to the restrictions; \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\" - Natasha emphasises that university no longer serves the purpose of networking and meeting new people because of social distancing.<nl><nl>2.0 \"...detached mentally from my studies\": recognising the lack of motivation.<nl>Main theme in this segment is how Natasha highlights the depletion of her mental well-being towards her studies and daily life. The lack of face-to-face teaching seems to be the reason for this, as further down the interview she mentions - \"I don\u2019t feel like a uni student (.) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m mentally there so my motivation has decreased signi-significantly\" which further supports the idea that the restrictions are detrimental to university students - due to the vast amount of lectures being moved online. This mentality and decrease of motivation may indicate a severe impact towards Natasha\u2019s mental health and well-being during this period of time. However, this could also be catastrophic for her university grades, as the lack of motivation may hinder the quality of her work and may lead her to underachieve. <nl><nl>2.1 \"...my mind is always in autopilot\": there is a lack of conscious control. <nl>Natasha goes on to use this phrase to describe her consciousness during the days in lockdown. This may emphasise the idea that her time spent in lockdown is constant and uneventful leading her to lose conscious awareness of what she is doing. The use of the word \"autopilot\" underlines the fact that she is aware that she is mentally detached from her life due to the sudden societal changes from the virus. On the other hand, it can be implied that she is comparing herself to that of a machine - where she is constantly stuck in a pattern doing the same thing daily.<nl>She goes on to mention that her \"days kinda merge into one\"- and further explains that she finds it easy to \"lose track\" of what she is doing and what she \"should be doing\",  which may lead to imply that lockdown has had both mental and physical obstacles, that Natasha has encountered and finds it difficult to plan her days and keep to a schedule. The use of the strong verb \"merge\" accentuates the difficulty Natasha is having to distinguish the days as they go by, possibly creating a blurred sense of reality whilst living with the restrictions.<nl><nl>2.2 \"spend the whole day in bed and its really taking a toll on me mentally\": is showing traits of a mental health disorder due to the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>When Natasha was asked how her daily life had changed, she proceeded to emphasise that the gym after the first lockdown, had allowed her to make progress \"mentally and physically\". However, the gyms were forced to close again following the second national lockdown. This proved to be a significant impact for Natasha \u2013 as further down in the answer she stated that she would \"spend the whole day in bed\". This may suggest that she may have been experiencing a mental health related disorder which could have been onset due to the second lockdown. This may portray the risk that the restrictions have towards the well-being of students. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, Natasha has had a wide range of negative changes and experiences whilst being a university student during the global pandemic\u2013 most aspects do relate to the new introduction of social distancing: which has proven to be a big change for her as she thrives of socialising and meeting new people. Natasha who has moved out from their hometown and is now situated in the city where she attends university is likely to feel lonely due to not being around friends or family. The decline in mental health has been evident \u2013 towards both her studies and daily life in general. Natasha finds it hard to live in the present and feels mentally absent on some days. This may indicate that being a student during the global pandemic is detrimental for individuals such as Natasha; leading to unhappiness, loneliness, disappointment, decline in mental health and being unmotivated.

Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent (CI) than the colour congruent (CC) condition. (M= 966.8, SD= 405.1). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( T= 403, n= 59, p= &lt; .001). Data shows that participants took longer to correctly identify the font colours when they were incongruent with the colour of the words written. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>The results that were found were consistent with previous research of Stroop (1935) and supported the hypothesis as participants did have a slower reaction time when identifying incongruent font colours and had a faster reaction time for the congruent condition. The reaction time was faster for the congruent condition because Cattell (1886) argued that wording reading is automatic therefore it\u2019s quicker for individuals to read the word represented to them in that condition. However, different research finding has been reported from a similar stroop task called emotional stroop (Williams et al. 1996). It was found that the emotional Stroop involves only emotional and neutral words and that color does not affect reaction time because it does not conflict with word meaning. The classic stroop test shows that the reaction time is slower because there is a conflict between an incongruent color and the word. Furthermore,  Salthouse and Meinz (1995) argue that even though age differences specific to stroop interference were minimal, other research may show the relationship between age and Stroop interference was still significant (West &amp; Baylis, 1998). <nl><nl>Finally, some of the methodological issues regarding the experiment were that volunteer sampling was used, only university students participated. Findings cannot be generalised to those who did not volunteer and the finding may not be representative of the whole population. An improvement could be made by selecting people of all ages not just university students. Another issue was that the experiment was not completed in a controlled environment, this means they could have had help from others. Another improvement could be that all the participants complete the test in a psychology lab. Also there may have been extraneous variables which may have affected the results, e.g. some participants may have completed at 9am, they would most likely been tired and have had a slower reaction time. This can be improved by making sure all students complete the test at the same time."]}

In this lockdown period, it was reported that learners were mostly suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety (42.0%) (Kapasia, N., Paul, P., Roy, A., Saha, J., Zaveri, A., Mallick, R., ... &amp; Chouhan, P. 2020). The negative impact on student mental and physical well-being due to lockdown restrictions, may be seen as detrimental for their academia and overall performance. Other research has been carried out on the wider population, not students specifically, however the COVID-19 lockdown can be seen to affect others negatively, in terms of mental health. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderatesevere insomnia (Gualano, M. R., Lo Moro, G., Voglino, G., Bert, F., &amp; Siliquini, R. 2020). However, research on the wider student experience during COVID-19 in the UK lacks exposure, so the given indication to the gap, conducting this research could be beneficial to raise greater awareness to the subject.<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as the chosen method<nl>IPA is concerned with lived experience. Experience covers quite a lot of territory (Cooper, H. E., Camic, P. M., Long, D. L., Panter, A. T., Rindskopf, D. E., &amp; Sher, K. J. 2012). Furthermore, IPA focuses on the detailed examination of particulars, first providing an in-depth account of each case before moving to look for patterning\u2019s of convergence and divergence across cases (Eatough, V., &amp; Smith, J. A. 2008).  This method allows the researcher to analyse and understand an individual\u2019s experience towards a certain event \u2013 which in this case would be the global pandemic and how it has affected students: it allows us to explore different aspects that may have been impacted and gives us the chance to begin to comprehend those experiences. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>1. \"Feels like a waste of a university experience\"; a student who has been affected by the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>Missing out on experiences and opportunities as a university student, is a main theme in this account - which includes spending time with friends, enjoying the nightlife, parties and academic events (e.g. lectures and seminars). Natasha draws up on the fact that the university experience she is currently having is very different to what she had prior to the COVID-19 restrictions in her first year. Although, she highlights that she had been able to enjoy some of the perks of being a student in her first year of study, she emphasises the lack of it now and realises that she had taken for granted some of the opportunities she had in first year, as she states - \"I definitely should have taken those erm (.) opportunities and just spend it with the people I like being around\". This may highlight the idea that Natasha feels regret because certain experiences are not as readily available as they were before.<nl>1.1 \"I\u2019m not seeing my friends as often as I would do... I\u2019m not going out\": the negatives highlighted due to the lockdown. <nl>Natasha was asked to compare her first year to her current year of university, and the main focus had been that there is a lack of opportunity to go out with friends - to restaurants, clubs and parties: all of which have been impacted significantly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. Further down in the interview she once again emphasises the fact that she yearns for a greater chance to go out to social events: \"I really do miss going out with them and seeing them and spending time with them\". It may suggest that Natasha, who is already limited by the distance from university to her hometown and who may have relied on interaction from social events at university, has been severely impacted and may go on to feel \"lonely\" within these circumstances, as she had previously mentioned when asked who she was able to communicate with at the moment. <nl><nl>There is no doubt that one of the main disadvantages Natasha focuses on is the idea that her personality is hindered by the lockdown: \"there is a lot of downsides...one of the things I love the most like going out, seeing my friends\", she draws attention to this significant piece missing in her life and emphasises how much she enjoys going out and seeing my friends by using the word \"love\". Due to the restrictions there may be an imbalance of work and leisure, Natasha may feel as though she is trapped in unhappiness during this global pandemic. <nl>1.2 \"...I\u2019ve not met anyone new on my course which is a bit upsetting\": the lack of engagement due to face-to-face teaching being moved online. <nl>When Natasha was asked: \"How they get along with engaging with other students\" - the response steered in a direction where she expressed a disappointment in the lack of opportunity to meet new course mates. She stated this a couple of times whilst answering this question: \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\", which may indicate that she has been deeply affected by the fact that the opportunity to engage with other students has been stripped away.<nl>University can be advertised amongst students as being a place where there is a chance to meet many different people - however, the outlook has changed significantly as those opportunities have been limited due to the restrictions; \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\" - Natasha emphasises that university no longer serves the purpose of networking and meeting new people because of social distancing.<nl><nl>2.0 \"...detached mentally from my studies\": recognising the lack of motivation.<nl>Main theme in this segment is how Natasha highlights the depletion of her mental well-being towards her studies and daily life. The lack of face-to-face teaching seems to be the reason for this, as further down the interview she mentions - \"I don\u2019t feel like a uni student (.) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m mentally there so my motivation has decreased signi-significantly\" which further supports the idea that the restrictions are detrimental to university students - due to the vast amount of lectures being moved online. This mentality and decrease of motivation may indicate a severe impact towards Natasha\u2019s mental health and well-being during this period of time. However, this could also be catastrophic for her university grades, as the lack of motivation may hinder the quality of her work and may lead her to underachieve. <nl><nl>2.1 \"...my mind is always in autopilot\": there is a lack of conscious control. <nl>Natasha goes on to use this phrase to describe her consciousness during the days in lockdown. This may emphasise the idea that her time spent in lockdown is constant and uneventful leading her to lose conscious awareness of what she is doing. The use of the word \"autopilot\" underlines the fact that she is aware that she is mentally detached from her life due to the sudden societal changes from the virus. On the other hand, it can be implied that she is comparing herself to that of a machine - where she is constantly stuck in a pattern doing the same thing daily.<nl>She goes on to mention that her \"days kinda merge into one\"- and further explains that she finds it easy to \"lose track\" of what she is doing and what she \"should be doing\",  which may lead to imply that lockdown has had both mental and physical obstacles, that Natasha has encountered and finds it difficult to plan her days and keep to a schedule. The use of the strong verb \"merge\" accentuates the difficulty Natasha is having to distinguish the days as they go by, possibly creating a blurred sense of reality whilst living with the restrictions.<nl><nl>2.2 \"spend the whole day in bed and its really taking a toll on me mentally\": is showing traits of a mental health disorder due to the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>When Natasha was asked how her daily life had changed, she proceeded to emphasise that the gym after the first lockdown, had allowed her to make progress \"mentally and physically\". However, the gyms were forced to close again following the second national lockdown. This proved to be a significant impact for Natasha \u2013 as further down in the answer she stated that she would \"spend the whole day in bed\". This may suggest that she may have been experiencing a mental health related disorder which could have been onset due to the second lockdown. This may portray the risk that the restrictions have towards the well-being of students. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, Natasha has had a wide range of negative changes and experiences whilst being a university student during the global pandemic\u2013 most aspects do relate to the new introduction of social distancing: which has proven to be a big change for her as she thrives of socialising and meeting new people. Natasha who has moved out from their hometown and is now situated in the city where she attends university is likely to feel lonely due to not being around friends or family. The decline in mental health has been evident \u2013 towards both her studies and daily life in general. Natasha finds it hard to live in the present and feels mentally absent on some days. This may indicate that being a student during the global pandemic is detrimental for individuals such as Natasha; leading to unhappiness, loneliness, disappointment, decline in mental health and being unmotivated.

Within this task they were presented with the 30 previously seen and 30 previously unseen targets. The words were moderately concrete and low imageability. Participants were assigned a mental arithmetic task to complete between study and recognition stages. They completed two consecutive word recognition tasks: one on its own and one concurrently with a finger tapping task where a metronome was used to track time per second (1Hz). In order to counterbalance, a Latin square was used to minimize order effect.

{"id": "deb641ec-a63e-4983-8891-b78245589ada00649", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>This paper will examine whether there is a difference in how males and females use language when in the role of competition judge, and whether the formality of the situation has an impact. This study will focus on the politeness strategies used by each gender when critiquing the contestants. To achieve this, it will investigate the number of lines of speech, the use of positive as opposed to negative adjectives and the use of hedges or intensifiers. A hedge is a linguistic device used to mitigate a statement by lowering epistemic modality and directness with the goal of reducing the threat to face (Salager-Meyer, 1994; Brown and Levinson, 1978.) On the other hand, an intensifier is an adverb or adverbial phrase used to give emphasis (Bolinger, 1972). <nl>The data used in this study is from The Great British Bake Off (which will from here onwards be referred to as GBBO) and MasterChef: The Professionals, which will simply be referred to as MasterChef. These two programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions, but MasterChef features professional chefs and GBBO amateur bakers. There is also a difference in formality as GBBO is more informal and light-hearted which is shown by its two presenters both being comedians. On the other hand, MasterChef is more formal in tone and takes a more serious approach. <nl>This topic has been chosen as it combines politeness theories with gender theory in order to examine how they interact with each other, applying this to a competition environment. Both of the datasets are from television shows therefore it is important to take into account that they may be edited to portray people in a certain way or to best fulfil the main purpose of the shows, which is to entertain. It will be interesting to see how this artificial environment impacts the judges as they may be inclined to be more polite than usual in order to portray themselves well on television, or less polite if their career is based on them playing a \"villain\" role.<nl><nl>Research Background <nl>There has been much debate by linguistics over the relationship between gender and language and the effect the former has on the latter. One of the seminal theorists in this subject is Robin Lakoff (1975) who suggested that there are fundamental differences in how men and women use language. Most relevant to this paper was her identified differences in the use of polite forms, with women typically using more polite forms than men. Janet Holmes (2013) also agreed that women are more likely to use polite forms, although acknowledged that there are differences depending on factors such as the context of the interaction and the specific people involved. She argued that: <nl>\"when all the necessary reservations and qualifications have been taken into account, I think the answer is \u2018yes, women are more polite than men\u2019\" (Holmes, 1995: 5). <nl>It has also been suggested that women use more polite forms as they are more powerless than men (Deuchar, 1988). One theory that supports this is the dominance theory which investigated the number of interruptions between men and women in a mixed gender conversation (Zimmerman and West, 1975). The study found that men are much more likely to interrupt than women and across the eleven conversations they recorded women interrupted only twice whereas men interrupted 46 times. This supports the idea that women are more polite than men, however the study only has a small sample size of 35 participants, all of whom were from a similar background, and is over 45 years old. <nl>Looking more closely at politeness, it can be defined as a type of communication that shows respect and gives some benefit to the other communicators (Leech, 2014). It is an act which aims to maintain the other participants\u2019 positive and negative face (Goffman, 1967). <nl>Leech\u2019s politeness principle (1983) argues that speakers must follow six maxims in order to be considered polite. The theory builds on Grice\u2019s maxims of conversation (1975) but expands these maxim\u2019s and focuses them specifically on appearing polite. These maxims of politeness are; tact, generosity, approbation, modesty and agreement. This study will focus on the maxim of approbation, which involves maximising expressions of praise and approval and lessening the expressions of dispraise. <nl>In a recent study, these maxims were applied to high school students and their interactions with teachers in order to investigate how gender influences politeness (Ningsih et al., 2020). The study used a qualitive approach and gathered data through observations and recordings. They found that both male and female students adhered to the politeness principle more strongly with female teachers than with male teachers. This could suggest that how polite a speaker is depends on the gender of the person they are speaking to more than their own gender identification. Although this study looks only at the speaker and does not take into account the gender of the addressee, this could account for some of the patterns of politeness encountered and therefore is worth taking into consideration. <nl>Looking at this previous research, it could be expected that the female judges in this study will show more behaviours associated with politeness than the male judges, which will be shown through an increase of positive adjectives and a decrease of negative adjectives. It is also expected that the female judges will more often seek to minimise the amount of dispraise given and use hedges to save the hearer\u2019s positive face, whilst using more intensifiers to emphasise praise. It is also anticipated that males will dominate the conversation more, which could be seen as impolite as they allow less room in the conversation for the female judges to speak.<nl><nl>Methodology <nl>The data used in this investigation is from the final episode of the 2020 series of GBBO and the 2020 final of MasterChef. In each episode there are three contestants remaining and so, by using the first challenge they are given in each, there are three sets of comparable data for each show. Each judgement was then transcribed using the key in appendix one. The narration in MasterChef was excluded from the transcripts as it was edited in later and therefore was not part of the conversation being analysed. This analysis only focused on the judge\u2019s communication; however, the contestants and presenter\u2019s speech were included in the transcriptions for context. <nl>These programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions and so the type of praisecriticism given is comparable. However, the difference in tone and level of formality between the programmes allows a deeper investigation into the impact of context on politeness. It will be of interest to see whether the hypothesises are realised and whether the tone and formality of each programme impacts this, and if so to what extent. These programmes were also chosen as they have mixed gender judging panels thus the impact of gender can be observed. <nl>Once the data had been collected, it was analysed using a quantitative approach. The number of lines of speech by each of the judges was counted in each extract and placed into table one. In MasterChef there were three judges, two of which were male. In order to calculate the number of lines of speech for the males, the number for each judge was added together and then divided by two. Although this removes the influence of the individual, which is a disadvantage, it allows the proportion of speech by each gender to be directly compared, which for the purposes of this investigation was deemed more important. <nl>When counting the lines of speech, each line was counted as a whole regardless of the length. However, there is one result which contains a half due to the calculation used to find the average. Speech was also counted as one line if it was transcribed across two due to interruption but the utterance carried on unbroken. <nl>The use of adjectives was also counted and placed into a table (table two) and the context of the utterance was used to determine whether an adjective was used positively as praise, or negatively to criticise. The same method was then applied to the use of hedges and intensifiers, which were then discussed in a qualitative light to determine the effect they had on the overall politeness of each statement.<nl><nl>Findings <nl>i. Amount of speech by male and female judges <nl>The following table summarises the number of lines of speech made by male and female judges in each dataset. As there were two male judges in MasterChef the average number of lines of speech made between them has been used, as mentioned in the methodology. <nl><table><nl>Looking at GBBO first, on average the male judge (Paul) utters more lines of speech than the female judge (Prue). In the judgements of contestants one and three, Paul utters eight lines of speech as opposed to Prue\u2019s six lines, an increase of 28.57%. This is befitting the hypothesis that the male judge will speak more than the female judge, however the data featuring contestant two conflicts with this. In this instance, Prue has one more line of speech than Paul which is a 22.22% difference. Overall, Paul speaks more than Prue in two of the three extracts, and in there is a greater difference between the judges when Paul is the one speaking more. Across all three extracts Paul is shown to utter 16.22% more lines of speech than Prue, conforming to the expected results. <nl>Analysing the MasterChef results, the males (Gregg and Marcus) utter more lines of speech in the judgements of contestants one and two than the female judge (Monica). In the transcript featuring contestant one there is a 40% difference in the number of utterances, and in the next there is a 22.22% difference. This is a greater increase in the amount of speech by males as opposed to females than was seen in GBBO. Yet, when the judgement of contestant three is analysed, the largest difference in speech of all the transcripts is shown with Monica speaking 66.67% more lines than the male judges. This means that overall, there is only a 3.39% difference between the male and female judges, with the female judge having uttered more lines in total. This disagrees with the hypothesis that men would talk more but the difference in utterance of lines is minimal. <nl>To conclude, the data from GBBO is in accordance with the hypothesis made that males will utter more lines of speech than females, but the data from MasterChef contradicts it. There are a few possible explanations for why this might have occurred. One explanation is the difference in tone between the two shows; In MasterChef the setting is more formal and professional whereas GBBO is a more informal setting where the judges interact with the contestants more colloquially. Therefore, GBBO mirrors normal conversations more than MasterChef and the context relates more closely to that of the studies researched for this paper. There is also a difference in the way the programmes are formatted. The judgement in GBBO is more like a conversation in the first challenge, so there are examples of turn-taking within the conversation. In contrast, on MasterChef the judges speak one at a time in longer instances and there are no conversations between them. This could influence the results as it means the participants are not dominating the conversation but rather giving a longer individual monologue. <nl>It is also of note that the extracts transcribed are only a couple of minutes long and therefore there is only a relatively small amount of data. In a longer conversation there is a possibility that the difference between male and female speech could become more defined.<nl><nl>ii. Use of adjectives <nl>When categorising the use of adjectives into positive or negative classifications, the context of the sentence was used to determine what category was most appropriate. They were then collated into the table below. <nl><table><nl>For example, \"wobbly\" was classed as a positive adjective as it was used in the utterance \"I like the wobbly lines\" (Appendix three, lines 20-22). <nl>Analysing the use of adjectives by the GBBO judges, Prue used more positive adjectives with each contestant as well as a greater range of adjectives. Looking at the use of negative adjectives, both judges used a similar number however Paul used one more. Therefore, the GBBO data aligns with the hypothesis that the female judge would use more adjectives that signal praise, and the male more negative adjectives. <nl>When comparing this to the results for the MasterChef data, Monica used an equal number of negative adjectives as Marcus, and one more than Gregg who did not use any. This contradicts the hypothesis and suggests that Monica is more willing to risk threatening the contestants face than Gregg, who only uses compliments. When judging the first contestant, Gregg used seven times as many adjectives to give praise than Monica did, and more than twice as many as Marcus. With the next contestant all three judges used the same number of positive adjectives and with the final contestant Monica used the most; using four times as many as Gregg and twice as many as Marcus. Ranking the judges based on their use of positive minus negative adjectives, Marcus and Monica both ranked the same and Gregg ranked highest meaning he is most concerned with politeness and least willing to flout the maxim of approbation. In summary, the data from MasterChef does not support the hypothesis and contrasts with the GBBO results. <nl><nl>iii. Use of hedges and intensifiers <nl>Within this table a colour-coding system has been using to differentiate between the hedges and intensifiers that have been used in relation to negative statements, and those that have been used positively. Text in green represents the words and phrases that have be used in relation to praise, and red has been used for text that relates to dispraise or criticism. <nl><table><nl>The intensifier \"very very\" was kept as one phrase within the table rather than two instances of the word \"very\" to emphasise how strongly the praise was given. <nl>The results from the analysis on hedging and intensifiers is similar to the patterns seen when investigating the use of adjectives. In the GBBO data, Prue used more positively associated hedges and intensifiers and fewer negative ones than Paul. <nl>Similarly, in the MasterChef data Gregg did not use any negative forms of these linguistic features which correlates with his use of adjectives. Although Marcus used more negative forms of the features than Monica, he also used more positive forms therefore showing they have an equal level of politeness as shown with their use of adjectives. <nl>Overall, this section again confirms that the judges in GBBO conform to the ideas of gender and politeness, whereas the judges in MasterChef do not. This could be down to the individual\u2019s character, as the social constructivist theory suggests that gender is only one part of our identity that influences communication; Personality, status, level of education and ethnicity also all serve to shape our communication (Burr, 2015). It suggests that people make each element of this construction relevant or irrelevant as is necessary. This suggests that Monica and Gregg could be choosing not to make their gender relevant to their role as judge, and each is relying on other factors to influence their use of praise instead. <nl><nl>Discussion <nl>One section that is particularly interesting is where Paul and Prue discussed the issues with Dave\u2019s custard slice in the GGBO. In the extract below, both judges use a mixture of hedges and praise to try and soften their criticism of Dave and minimise their flouting of the maxim of approbation. <nl><data_extract><nl>In cooking the adjective \"strong\" can be both positive or negative. In this extract Prue signals that she is using it positively by her use of the phrase \"I love the coffee\" before describing it as strong, thereby using it to praise Dave. The use of the intensifier \"really\" emphasises the strength of the flavour which adds to this praise. This extract also features the word \"stodgy\" three times. In the first instance, Paul used it to criticise Dave\u2019s custard which is an example of a positive face threatening act. However, Paul lessens the impact of the criticism by using the hedging phrase \"a little bit\" therefore minimising the expression of dispraise as laid out in Leech\u2019s maxim of approbation (1983). Prue then repeats this criticism however she uses the adjective \"stodgy\" twice with an emphasis on the first time. In this instance she is using the first expression of stodgy as a hedge to minimise the impact of the second expression, hereby implying it is not as bad as it could be and is only minorly stodgy. Again, this helps to minimise the impoliteness and helps to save face. \"Pretty\" is also used as a hedge in this extract, which lessens the compliment of it being \"delicious\". The use of the adverb \"still\" serves to further lessen it, so although Prue is paying a compliment, she is still acknowledging that the baking has flaws. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, the hypothesises that female judges would use more language concerned with politeness were realised to a certain extent. The patterns of communication shown by the GBBO judges did match up with what was expected, however the judges in MasterChef conformed to these expectations to a much lesser extent. This could be due to the formality of the show as opposed to the more colloquial nature of The Great British Bake Off, although it could also be due to the individual backgrounds and personalities of each judge. There is also a possibility that the gender of the contestant being judged has an impact on how the judges use politeness. Future research could investigate further by looking at a greater range of programmes and including more data for each. There is also an age difference of 35 years between the two female judges so it could be interesting to investigate deeper into how the changes in society between these years have influenced how women use language in reference to politeness.", "Good Afternoon,<nl><nl>Just to update you on my previous email, I have now been told I can work from home starting <day> <DDth>.<nl><nl>Thank you,<nl><nl><part_FN><new>Good Afternoon,<nl><nl>I am emailing as I am now staying with my placement company until <DDth> <month> rather than my original end date of <DDth> <month>.

Within this task they were presented with the 30 previously seen and 30 previously unseen targets. The words were moderately concrete and low imageability. Participants were assigned a mental arithmetic task to complete between study and recognition stages. They completed two consecutive word recognition tasks: one on its own and one concurrently with a finger tapping task where a metronome was used to track time per second (1Hz). In order to counterbalance, a Latin square was used to minimize order effect.

These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001)."]}

It is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued left than when cued right. Data from 38 participants was used. Within-subjects design. Independent variable had two levels: cue left, cue right. Dependant variable was the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V). EEG electrodes were attached to relevant areas using the 1020 system. The results showed that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions. The results are consistent with the hypothesis and previous research.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>The alpha inhibition hypothesis refers to the concept that high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha wave in the relaxation state has higher power spectrum than in the attention state. Yaomanee, K., Pan-ngum, S., &amp; Ayuthaya, P. I. N. (2012). Concluding that alpha activity can be modulated by attention, thus meaning that alpha activity is reduced when we pay attention to stimuli.<nl>This experiment is a partial replication of Sauseng et al., (2005). Overall, 22 participants used, and they were given a cued visual attention task. Cued with a fixation cross for 34ms, then an arrow cue would indicate which hemifield a target would appear in. There was a 50% chance of being cued left or right, 75% of the trials were valid and 25% of trials were invalid. Results indicated that parietal regions showed stronger alpha lower band frequency suppression contralateral to the attended hemifield. Similar results for upper frequencies. Therefore, the alpha inhibition hypothesis is supported by these findings as there is stronger alpha activity in the task irrelevant brain areas. <nl>To further support these findings, Mazahari et al., (2014) used 57 adolescent participants: 23 normally developing, 17 who have combined subtype ADHD (inattention and hyperactivity) and 17 who have predominantly inattentive ADHD. Used a cued flanker task. Response preparation cue predicted 84% accuracy, or a null cue was shown which had no information about correct response. Overall participants showed alpha suppression following response preparation cues, greater for normally developing participants and least for inattentive ADHD subtypes. The indicative alpha suppression supports the idea that alpha activity can be modulated by attention \u2013 thus being reduced when participants attended to the stimuli.<nl>Following on previous studies, it is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued to expect a stimulus on the left than when cued to expect a stimulus on the right, when recording from the left parietal lobe (P3).  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>To begin with, 39 undergraduate participants were obtained by volunteer sample, however, one participant was removed as they were only available for one of the two conditions: 38 participants overall. <nl>Design <nl>Within subject\u2019s design, with an independent variable of cue direction with two levels: either left or right. The dependent variable is the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V).<nl><nl>Materials <nl>A Biopac MP36 was used to record alpha range activity and receive event markers for cue left and cue right conditions. EEG electrodes which were attached to the head. AC Cream and Everi cream was used, in preparation prior to the attachment of electrodes. The software PsychoPy was used to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. Stimuli were used to present to the visual fields such as: arrow cues left (&lt;) and right (&gt;), large bar (Figure A) and small bar (Figure B) stimuli. <nl><figure><nl> <nl>Procedure <nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz. Digital channels were set up to receive the event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker. A calculation channel was also set up to record the activity in the alpha frequency range of (8 - 13 Hz). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. <nl>Before preparing the participants, they gave informed consent and were briefed on their right to withdraw from the experiment. To prepare the participants for electrode placement, Everi cream was used to abrase the areas P3, Fz and forehead, selected using the 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Techologies, 2012). The AC cream was then applied on the electrodes: an active electrode was attached to P3. Reference electrodes are attached at Fz. Earth electrodes were attached to the forehead, near the hairline. The impedance levels were checked to be below 10Kohms.  <nl>Participants were given instructions and a practice trial first and were cued with an arrow for 35ms to let participants know which side to expect a stimulus, with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) set to 600ms-800ms in the practice trial. Different event markers were sent at stimulus onset for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli consisted of either large or small white bars shown either left or right on the screen on a black background for 50ms. The participants respond with either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. They underwent 12 practice trials including feedback about their response, before undergoing 4 blocks of 20 trials. After the practice trail was complete, the participants were given feedback on their performance.<nl>The participants were shortly warned that the real experiment was about to start. The random ISI was set to 200ms-1200ms<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>To covert the raw 9-13 Hz Alpha EEG to averaged data. Event markers from PsychoPy were sent to identify when stimuli were presented. Then looked at the period 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown. The data was rectified, which turns the negative values into positive, in order to show alpha activity regardless of it being excitatory or inhibitory. Averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of the outlying or extreme values. The rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were then suitable for statistical analysis. <nl>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics<nl>Firstly, to determine whether the data is parametric, a Shapiro-Wilk test was used and p&lt;.005. The p value is less than .05, therefore, a non-parametric equivalent had to be used: <nl>Wilcoxon signed ranks test. <nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions and a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed this difference was significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were consistent with the predicted hypothesis, as the median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left, than cue right and this supports the idea that alpha activity at P3 is different depending on which side participants are cued to expect a stimulus. <nl>The results also support previous research and the alpha inhibition hypothesis, as high alpha shows the inhibition of task irrelevant areas due to more activity in the left hemisphere (Klimesch et al., 2007), on the ipsilateral side of where the cue was presented. <nl>Although the results are consistent with the hypothesis, confounding variables may have altered the data to an extent. The participants moving around, may have altered the validity as gross motor movements may contaminate the EEG recordings, (Bell, M. A., &amp; Cuevas, K., 2012).<nl>Overall, there may be some areas for improvement to prevent confounding variables from affecting the data. To prevent motor movements, the participants should be given strict instructions to follow due to the sensitivity of the EEG. The researchers should monitor the participants to check if those instructions are being followed. However, despite these issues, the results can be granted as valid as the correct procedures were taken during the experiment, such as ensuring the impedance levels were below 10Kohms and in addition the results were expected due to previous research.", "Hi, <nl><nl>I have completed all the tasks. <nl><nl>AGE: <age><nl>DOB: &lt;DDMMYYYY&gt;<nl>Handedness (left or right): right<new>Hi <addr10_FN>, <nl><nl>I am a second-year student, and I am currently doing my transcript for the project due next week.

{"id": "62c9b969-aa40-4862-90d6-83a193646b8701741", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Aims and Research Questions<nl>The lockdown amidst COVID-19 has made significant disruptions in academic activities. In this lockdown period, it was reported that learners were mostly suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety (42.0%) (Kapasia, N., Paul, P., Roy, A., Saha, J., Zaveri, A., Mallick, R., ... &amp; Chouhan, P. 2020). The negative impact on student mental and physical well-being due to lockdown restrictions, may be seen as detrimental for their academia and overall performance. Other research has been carried out on the wider population, not students specifically, however the COVID-19 lockdown can be seen to affect others negatively, in terms of mental health. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderatesevere insomnia (Gualano, M. R., Lo Moro, G., Voglino, G., Bert, F., &amp; Siliquini, R. 2020). However, research on the wider student experience during COVID-19 in the UK lacks exposure, so the given indication to the gap, conducting this research could be beneficial to raise greater awareness to the subject.<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as the chosen method<nl>IPA is concerned with lived experience. Experience covers quite a lot of territory (Cooper, H. E., Camic, P. M., Long, D. L., Panter, A. T., Rindskopf, D. E., &amp; Sher, K. J. 2012). Furthermore, IPA focuses on the detailed examination of particulars, first providing an in-depth account of each case before moving to look for patterning\u2019s of convergence and divergence across cases (Eatough, V., &amp; Smith, J. A. 2008).  This method allows the researcher to analyse and understand an individual\u2019s experience towards a certain event \u2013 which in this case would be the global pandemic and how it has affected students: it allows us to explore different aspects that may have been impacted and gives us the chance to begin to comprehend those experiences. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>1. \"Feels like a waste of a university experience\"; a student who has been affected by the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>Missing out on experiences and opportunities as a university student, is a main theme in this account - which includes spending time with friends, enjoying the nightlife, parties and academic events (e.g. lectures and seminars). Natasha draws up on the fact that the university experience she is currently having is very different to what she had prior to the COVID-19 restrictions in her first year. Although, she highlights that she had been able to enjoy some of the perks of being a student in her first year of study, she emphasises the lack of it now and realises that she had taken for granted some of the opportunities she had in first year, as she states - \"I definitely should have taken those erm (.) opportunities and just spend it with the people I like being around\". This may highlight the idea that Natasha feels regret because certain experiences are not as readily available as they were before.<nl>1.1 \"I\u2019m not seeing my friends as often as I would do... I\u2019m not going out\": the negatives highlighted due to the lockdown. <nl>Natasha was asked to compare her first year to her current year of university, and the main focus had been that there is a lack of opportunity to go out with friends - to restaurants, clubs and parties: all of which have been impacted significantly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. Further down in the interview she once again emphasises the fact that she yearns for a greater chance to go out to social events: \"I really do miss going out with them and seeing them and spending time with them\". It may suggest that Natasha, who is already limited by the distance from university to her hometown and who may have relied on interaction from social events at university, has been severely impacted and may go on to feel \"lonely\" within these circumstances, as she had previously mentioned when asked who she was able to communicate with at the moment. <nl><nl>There is no doubt that one of the main disadvantages Natasha focuses on is the idea that her personality is hindered by the lockdown: \"there is a lot of downsides...one of the things I love the most like going out, seeing my friends\", she draws attention to this significant piece missing in her life and emphasises how much she enjoys going out and seeing my friends by using the word \"love\". Due to the restrictions there may be an imbalance of work and leisure, Natasha may feel as though she is trapped in unhappiness during this global pandemic. <nl>1.2 \"...I\u2019ve not met anyone new on my course which is a bit upsetting\": the lack of engagement due to face-to-face teaching being moved online. <nl>When Natasha was asked: \"How they get along with engaging with other students\" - the response steered in a direction where she expressed a disappointment in the lack of opportunity to meet new course mates. She stated this a couple of times whilst answering this question: \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\", which may indicate that she has been deeply affected by the fact that the opportunity to engage with other students has been stripped away.<nl>University can be advertised amongst students as being a place where there is a chance to meet many different people - however, the outlook has changed significantly as those opportunities have been limited due to the restrictions; \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\" - Natasha emphasises that university no longer serves the purpose of networking and meeting new people because of social distancing.<nl><nl>2.0 \"...detached mentally from my studies\": recognising the lack of motivation.<nl>Main theme in this segment is how Natasha highlights the depletion of her mental well-being towards her studies and daily life. The lack of face-to-face teaching seems to be the reason for this, as further down the interview she mentions - \"I don\u2019t feel like a uni student (.) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m mentally there so my motivation has decreased signi-significantly\" which further supports the idea that the restrictions are detrimental to university students - due to the vast amount of lectures being moved online. This mentality and decrease of motivation may indicate a severe impact towards Natasha\u2019s mental health and well-being during this period of time. However, this could also be catastrophic for her university grades, as the lack of motivation may hinder the quality of her work and may lead her to underachieve. <nl><nl>2.1 \"...my mind is always in autopilot\": there is a lack of conscious control. <nl>Natasha goes on to use this phrase to describe her consciousness during the days in lockdown. This may emphasise the idea that her time spent in lockdown is constant and uneventful leading her to lose conscious awareness of what she is doing. The use of the word \"autopilot\" underlines the fact that she is aware that she is mentally detached from her life due to the sudden societal changes from the virus. On the other hand, it can be implied that she is comparing herself to that of a machine - where she is constantly stuck in a pattern doing the same thing daily.<nl>She goes on to mention that her \"days kinda merge into one\"- and further explains that she finds it easy to \"lose track\" of what she is doing and what she \"should be doing\",  which may lead to imply that lockdown has had both mental and physical obstacles, that Natasha has encountered and finds it difficult to plan her days and keep to a schedule. The use of the strong verb \"merge\" accentuates the difficulty Natasha is having to distinguish the days as they go by, possibly creating a blurred sense of reality whilst living with the restrictions.<nl><nl>2.2 \"spend the whole day in bed and its really taking a toll on me mentally\": is showing traits of a mental health disorder due to the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>When Natasha was asked how her daily life had changed, she proceeded to emphasise that the gym after the first lockdown, had allowed her to make progress \"mentally and physically\". However, the gyms were forced to close again following the second national lockdown. This proved to be a significant impact for Natasha \u2013 as further down in the answer she stated that she would \"spend the whole day in bed\". This may suggest that she may have been experiencing a mental health related disorder which could have been onset due to the second lockdown. This may portray the risk that the restrictions have towards the well-being of students. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, Natasha has had a wide range of negative changes and experiences whilst being a university student during the global pandemic\u2013 most aspects do relate to the new introduction of social distancing: which has proven to be a big change for her as she thrives of socialising and meeting new people. Natasha who has moved out from their hometown and is now situated in the city where she attends university is likely to feel lonely due to not being around friends or family. The decline in mental health has been evident \u2013 towards both her studies and daily life in general. Natasha finds it hard to live in the present and feels mentally absent on some days. This may indicate that being a student during the global pandemic is detrimental for individuals such as Natasha; leading to unhappiness, loneliness, disappointment, decline in mental health and being unmotivated.

Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent (CI) than the colour congruent (CC) condition. (M= 966.8, SD= 405.1). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( T= 403, n= 59, p= &lt; .001). Data shows that participants took longer to correctly identify the font colours when they were incongruent with the colour of the words written. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>The results that were found were consistent with previous research of Stroop (1935) and supported the hypothesis as participants did have a slower reaction time when identifying incongruent font colours and had a faster reaction time for the congruent condition. The reaction time was faster for the congruent condition because Cattell (1886) argued that wording reading is automatic therefore it\u2019s quicker for individuals to read the word represented to them in that condition. However, different research finding has been reported from a similar stroop task called emotional stroop (Williams et al. 1996). It was found that the emotional Stroop involves only emotional and neutral words and that color does not affect reaction time because it does not conflict with word meaning. The classic stroop test shows that the reaction time is slower because there is a conflict between an incongruent color and the word. Furthermore,  Salthouse and Meinz (1995) argue that even though age differences specific to stroop interference were minimal, other research may show the relationship between age and Stroop interference was still significant (West &amp; Baylis, 1998). <nl><nl>Finally, some of the methodological issues regarding the experiment were that volunteer sampling was used, only university students participated. Findings cannot be generalised to those who did not volunteer and the finding may not be representative of the whole population. An improvement could be made by selecting people of all ages not just university students. Another issue was that the experiment was not completed in a controlled environment, this means they could have had help from others. Another improvement could be that all the participants complete the test in a psychology lab. Also there may have been extraneous variables which may have affected the results, e.g. some participants may have completed at 9am, they would most likely been tired and have had a slower reaction time. This can be improved by making sure all students complete the test at the same time."]}

{"id": "9f7f4136-abd2-4188-86d2-a9f7eb8b9677", "discourse_types": ["essay", "speech_transcription"], "pair": ["Aims and Research Questions<nl>The lockdown amidst COVID-19 has made significant disruptions in academic activities. In this lockdown period, it was reported that learners were mostly suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety (42.0%) (Kapasia, N., Paul, P., Roy, A., Saha, J., Zaveri, A., Mallick, R., ... &amp; Chouhan, P. 2020). The negative impact on student mental and physical well-being due to lockdown restrictions, may be seen as detrimental for their academia and overall performance. Other research has been carried out on the wider population, not students specifically, however the COVID-19 lockdown can be seen to affect others negatively, in terms of mental health. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderatesevere insomnia (Gualano, M. R., Lo Moro, G., Voglino, G., Bert, F., &amp; Siliquini, R. 2020). However, research on the wider student experience during COVID-19 in the UK lacks exposure, so the given indication to the gap, conducting this research could be beneficial to raise greater awareness to the subject.<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as the chosen method<nl>IPA is concerned with lived experience. Experience covers quite a lot of territory (Cooper, H. E., Camic, P. M., Long, D. L., Panter, A. T., Rindskopf, D. E., &amp; Sher, K. J. 2012). Furthermore, IPA focuses on the detailed examination of particulars, first providing an in-depth account of each case before moving to look for patterning\u2019s of convergence and divergence across cases (Eatough, V., &amp; Smith, J. A. 2008).  This method allows the researcher to analyse and understand an individual\u2019s experience towards a certain event \u2013 which in this case would be the global pandemic and how it has affected students: it allows us to explore different aspects that may have been impacted and gives us the chance to begin to comprehend those experiences. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>1. \"Feels like a waste of a university experience\"; a student who has been affected by the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>Missing out on experiences and opportunities as a university student, is a main theme in this account - which includes spending time with friends, enjoying the nightlife, parties and academic events (e.g. lectures and seminars). Natasha draws up on the fact that the university experience she is currently having is very different to what she had prior to the COVID-19 restrictions in her first year. Although, she highlights that she had been able to enjoy some of the perks of being a student in her first year of study, she emphasises the lack of it now and realises that she had taken for granted some of the opportunities she had in first year, as she states - \"I definitely should have taken those erm (.) opportunities and just spend it with the people I like being around\". This may highlight the idea that Natasha feels regret because certain experiences are not as readily available as they were before.<nl>1.1 \"I\u2019m not seeing my friends as often as I would do... I\u2019m not going out\": the negatives highlighted due to the lockdown. <nl>Natasha was asked to compare her first year to her current year of university, and the main focus had been that there is a lack of opportunity to go out with friends - to restaurants, clubs and parties: all of which have been impacted significantly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. Further down in the interview she once again emphasises the fact that she yearns for a greater chance to go out to social events: \"I really do miss going out with them and seeing them and spending time with them\". It may suggest that Natasha, who is already limited by the distance from university to her hometown and who may have relied on interaction from social events at university, has been severely impacted and may go on to feel \"lonely\" within these circumstances, as she had previously mentioned when asked who she was able to communicate with at the moment. <nl><nl>There is no doubt that one of the main disadvantages Natasha focuses on is the idea that her personality is hindered by the lockdown: \"there is a lot of downsides...one of the things I love the most like going out, seeing my friends\", she draws attention to this significant piece missing in her life and emphasises how much she enjoys going out and seeing my friends by using the word \"love\". Due to the restrictions there may be an imbalance of work and leisure, Natasha may feel as though she is trapped in unhappiness during this global pandemic. <nl>1.2 \"...I\u2019ve not met anyone new on my course which is a bit upsetting\": the lack of engagement due to face-to-face teaching being moved online. <nl>When Natasha was asked: \"How they get along with engaging with other students\" - the response steered in a direction where she expressed a disappointment in the lack of opportunity to meet new course mates. She stated this a couple of times whilst answering this question: \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\", which may indicate that she has been deeply affected by the fact that the opportunity to engage with other students has been stripped away.<nl>University can be advertised amongst students as being a place where there is a chance to meet many different people - however, the outlook has changed significantly as those opportunities have been limited due to the restrictions; \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\" - Natasha emphasises that university no longer serves the purpose of networking and meeting new people because of social distancing.<nl><nl>2.0 \"...detached mentally from my studies\": recognising the lack of motivation.<nl>Main theme in this segment is how Natasha highlights the depletion of her mental well-being towards her studies and daily life. The lack of face-to-face teaching seems to be the reason for this, as further down the interview she mentions - \"I don\u2019t feel like a uni student (.) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m mentally there so my motivation has decreased signi-significantly\" which further supports the idea that the restrictions are detrimental to university students - due to the vast amount of lectures being moved online. This mentality and decrease of motivation may indicate a severe impact towards Natasha\u2019s mental health and well-being during this period of time. However, this could also be catastrophic for her university grades, as the lack of motivation may hinder the quality of her work and may lead her to underachieve. <nl><nl>2.1 \"...my mind is always in autopilot\": there is a lack of conscious control. <nl>Natasha goes on to use this phrase to describe her consciousness during the days in lockdown. This may emphasise the idea that her time spent in lockdown is constant and uneventful leading her to lose conscious awareness of what she is doing. The use of the word \"autopilot\" underlines the fact that she is aware that she is mentally detached from her life due to the sudden societal changes from the virus. On the other hand, it can be implied that she is comparing herself to that of a machine - where she is constantly stuck in a pattern doing the same thing daily.<nl>She goes on to mention that her \"days kinda merge into one\"- and further explains that she finds it easy to \"lose track\" of what she is doing and what she \"should be doing\",  which may lead to imply that lockdown has had both mental and physical obstacles, that Natasha has encountered and finds it difficult to plan her days and keep to a schedule. The use of the strong verb \"merge\" accentuates the difficulty Natasha is having to distinguish the days as they go by, possibly creating a blurred sense of reality whilst living with the restrictions.<nl><nl>2.2 \"spend the whole day in bed and its really taking a toll on me mentally\": is showing traits of a mental health disorder due to the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>When Natasha was asked how her daily life had changed, she proceeded to emphasise that the gym after the first lockdown, had allowed her to make progress \"mentally and physically\". However, the gyms were forced to close again following the second national lockdown. This proved to be a significant impact for Natasha \u2013 as further down in the answer she stated that she would \"spend the whole day in bed\". This may suggest that she may have been experiencing a mental health related disorder which could have been onset due to the second lockdown. This may portray the risk that the restrictions have towards the well-being of students. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, Natasha has had a wide range of negative changes and experiences whilst being a university student during the global pandemic\u2013 most aspects do relate to the new introduction of social distancing: which has proven to be a big change for her as she thrives of socialising and meeting new people. Natasha who has moved out from their hometown and is now situated in the city where she attends university is likely to feel lonely due to not being around friends or family. The decline in mental health has been evident \u2013 towards both her studies and daily life in general. Natasha finds it hard to live in the present and feels mentally absent on some days. This may indicate that being a student during the global pandemic is detrimental for individuals such as Natasha; leading to unhappiness, loneliness, disappointment, decline in mental health and being unmotivated.

The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001)."]}

{"id": "c21dc518-fc3a-4837-8e1e-b5d89a82312a", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Aims and Research Questions<nl>The lockdown amidst COVID-19 has made significant disruptions in academic activities. In this lockdown period, it was reported that learners were mostly suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety (42.0%) (Kapasia, N., Paul, P., Roy, A., Saha, J., Zaveri, A., Mallick, R., ... &amp; Chouhan, P. 2020). The negative impact on student mental and physical well-being due to lockdown restrictions, may be seen as detrimental for their academia and overall performance. Other research has been carried out on the wider population, not students specifically, however the COVID-19 lockdown can be seen to affect others negatively, in terms of mental health. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderatesevere insomnia (Gualano, M. R., Lo Moro, G., Voglino, G., Bert, F., &amp; Siliquini, R. 2020). However, research on the wider student experience during COVID-19 in the UK lacks exposure, so the given indication to the gap, conducting this research could be beneficial to raise greater awareness to the subject.<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as the chosen method<nl>IPA is concerned with lived experience. Experience covers quite a lot of territory (Cooper, H. E., Camic, P. M., Long, D. L., Panter, A. T., Rindskopf, D. E., &amp; Sher, K. J. 2012). Furthermore, IPA focuses on the detailed examination of particulars, first providing an in-depth account of each case before moving to look for patterning\u2019s of convergence and divergence across cases (Eatough, V., &amp; Smith, J. A. 2008).  This method allows the researcher to analyse and understand an individual\u2019s experience towards a certain event \u2013 which in this case would be the global pandemic and how it has affected students: it allows us to explore different aspects that may have been impacted and gives us the chance to begin to comprehend those experiences. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>1. \"Feels like a waste of a university experience\"; a student who has been affected by the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>Missing out on experiences and opportunities as a university student, is a main theme in this account - which includes spending time with friends, enjoying the nightlife, parties and academic events (e.g. lectures and seminars). Natasha draws up on the fact that the university experience she is currently having is very different to what she had prior to the COVID-19 restrictions in her first year. Although, she highlights that she had been able to enjoy some of the perks of being a student in her first year of study, she emphasises the lack of it now and realises that she had taken for granted some of the opportunities she had in first year, as she states - \"I definitely should have taken those erm (.) opportunities and just spend it with the people I like being around\". This may highlight the idea that Natasha feels regret because certain experiences are not as readily available as they were before.<nl>1.1 \"I\u2019m not seeing my friends as often as I would do... I\u2019m not going out\": the negatives highlighted due to the lockdown. <nl>Natasha was asked to compare her first year to her current year of university, and the main focus had been that there is a lack of opportunity to go out with friends - to restaurants, clubs and parties: all of which have been impacted significantly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. Further down in the interview she once again emphasises the fact that she yearns for a greater chance to go out to social events: \"I really do miss going out with them and seeing them and spending time with them\". It may suggest that Natasha, who is already limited by the distance from university to her hometown and who may have relied on interaction from social events at university, has been severely impacted and may go on to feel \"lonely\" within these circumstances, as she had previously mentioned when asked who she was able to communicate with at the moment. <nl><nl>There is no doubt that one of the main disadvantages Natasha focuses on is the idea that her personality is hindered by the lockdown: \"there is a lot of downsides...one of the things I love the most like going out, seeing my friends\", she draws attention to this significant piece missing in her life and emphasises how much she enjoys going out and seeing my friends by using the word \"love\". Due to the restrictions there may be an imbalance of work and leisure, Natasha may feel as though she is trapped in unhappiness during this global pandemic. <nl>1.2 \"...I\u2019ve not met anyone new on my course which is a bit upsetting\": the lack of engagement due to face-to-face teaching being moved online. <nl>When Natasha was asked: \"How they get along with engaging with other students\" - the response steered in a direction where she expressed a disappointment in the lack of opportunity to meet new course mates. She stated this a couple of times whilst answering this question: \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\", which may indicate that she has been deeply affected by the fact that the opportunity to engage with other students has been stripped away.<nl>University can be advertised amongst students as being a place where there is a chance to meet many different people - however, the outlook has changed significantly as those opportunities have been limited due to the restrictions; \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\" - Natasha emphasises that university no longer serves the purpose of networking and meeting new people because of social distancing.<nl><nl>2.0 \"...detached mentally from my studies\": recognising the lack of motivation.<nl>Main theme in this segment is how Natasha highlights the depletion of her mental well-being towards her studies and daily life. The lack of face-to-face teaching seems to be the reason for this, as further down the interview she mentions - \"I don\u2019t feel like a uni student (.) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m mentally there so my motivation has decreased signi-significantly\" which further supports the idea that the restrictions are detrimental to university students - due to the vast amount of lectures being moved online. This mentality and decrease of motivation may indicate a severe impact towards Natasha\u2019s mental health and well-being during this period of time. However, this could also be catastrophic for her university grades, as the lack of motivation may hinder the quality of her work and may lead her to underachieve. <nl><nl>2.1 \"...my mind is always in autopilot\": there is a lack of conscious control. <nl>Natasha goes on to use this phrase to describe her consciousness during the days in lockdown. This may emphasise the idea that her time spent in lockdown is constant and uneventful leading her to lose conscious awareness of what she is doing. The use of the word \"autopilot\" underlines the fact that she is aware that she is mentally detached from her life due to the sudden societal changes from the virus. On the other hand, it can be implied that she is comparing herself to that of a machine - where she is constantly stuck in a pattern doing the same thing daily.<nl>She goes on to mention that her \"days kinda merge into one\"- and further explains that she finds it easy to \"lose track\" of what she is doing and what she \"should be doing\",  which may lead to imply that lockdown has had both mental and physical obstacles, that Natasha has encountered and finds it difficult to plan her days and keep to a schedule. The use of the strong verb \"merge\" accentuates the difficulty Natasha is having to distinguish the days as they go by, possibly creating a blurred sense of reality whilst living with the restrictions.<nl><nl>2.2 \"spend the whole day in bed and its really taking a toll on me mentally\": is showing traits of a mental health disorder due to the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>When Natasha was asked how her daily life had changed, she proceeded to emphasise that the gym after the first lockdown, had allowed her to make progress \"mentally and physically\". However, the gyms were forced to close again following the second national lockdown. This proved to be a significant impact for Natasha \u2013 as further down in the answer she stated that she would \"spend the whole day in bed\". This may suggest that she may have been experiencing a mental health related disorder which could have been onset due to the second lockdown. This may portray the risk that the restrictions have towards the well-being of students. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, Natasha has had a wide range of negative changes and experiences whilst being a university student during the global pandemic\u2013 most aspects do relate to the new introduction of social distancing: which has proven to be a big change for her as she thrives of socialising and meeting new people. Natasha who has moved out from their hometown and is now situated in the city where she attends university is likely to feel lonely due to not being around friends or family. The decline in mental health has been evident \u2013 towards both her studies and daily life in general. Natasha finds it hard to live in the present and feels mentally absent on some days. This may indicate that being a student during the global pandemic is detrimental for individuals such as Natasha; leading to unhappiness, loneliness, disappointment, decline in mental health and being unmotivated.

I will look at how they use the politeness theories to critique the contestants and will see if there is a noticeable difference between the two shows with one being aimed at professional chefs and the other being amateurs and more of a light-hearted show.  I will use the most recent series of each and look at the semi-final and final rounds. <nl><nl>Kind regards,<nl><nl><part_FN>"]}

Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001)."]}

It is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued left than when cued right. Data from 38 participants was used. Within-subjects design. Independent variable had two levels: cue left, cue right. Dependant variable was the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V). EEG electrodes were attached to relevant areas using the 1020 system. The results showed that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions. The results are consistent with the hypothesis and previous research.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>The alpha inhibition hypothesis refers to the concept that high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha wave in the relaxation state has higher power spectrum than in the attention state. Yaomanee, K., Pan-ngum, S., &amp; Ayuthaya, P. I. N. (2012). Concluding that alpha activity can be modulated by attention, thus meaning that alpha activity is reduced when we pay attention to stimuli.<nl>This experiment is a partial replication of Sauseng et al., (2005). Overall, 22 participants used, and they were given a cued visual attention task. Cued with a fixation cross for 34ms, then an arrow cue would indicate which hemifield a target would appear in. There was a 50% chance of being cued left or right, 75% of the trials were valid and 25% of trials were invalid. Results indicated that parietal regions showed stronger alpha lower band frequency suppression contralateral to the attended hemifield. Similar results for upper frequencies. Therefore, the alpha inhibition hypothesis is supported by these findings as there is stronger alpha activity in the task irrelevant brain areas. <nl>To further support these findings, Mazahari et al., (2014) used 57 adolescent participants: 23 normally developing, 17 who have combined subtype ADHD (inattention and hyperactivity) and 17 who have predominantly inattentive ADHD. Used a cued flanker task. Response preparation cue predicted 84% accuracy, or a null cue was shown which had no information about correct response. Overall participants showed alpha suppression following response preparation cues, greater for normally developing participants and least for inattentive ADHD subtypes. The indicative alpha suppression supports the idea that alpha activity can be modulated by attention \u2013 thus being reduced when participants attended to the stimuli.<nl>Following on previous studies, it is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued to expect a stimulus on the left than when cued to expect a stimulus on the right, when recording from the left parietal lobe (P3).  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>To begin with, 39 undergraduate participants were obtained by volunteer sample, however, one participant was removed as they were only available for one of the two conditions: 38 participants overall. <nl>Design <nl>Within subject\u2019s design, with an independent variable of cue direction with two levels: either left or right.

EEG electrodes which were attached to the head. AC Cream and Everi cream was used, in preparation prior to the attachment of electrodes. The software PsychoPy was used to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. Stimuli were used to present to the visual fields such as: arrow cues left (&lt;) and right (&gt;), large bar (Figure A) and small bar (Figure B) stimuli. <nl><figure><nl> <nl>Procedure <nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz. Digital channels were set up to receive the event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker. A calculation channel was also set up to record the activity in the alpha frequency range of (8 - 13 Hz). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. <nl>Before preparing the participants, they gave informed consent and were briefed on their right to withdraw from the experiment. To prepare the participants for electrode placement, Everi cream was used to abrase the areas P3, Fz and forehead, selected using the 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Techologies, 2012). The AC cream was then applied on the electrodes: an active electrode was attached to P3. Reference electrodes are attached at Fz. Earth electrodes were attached to the forehead, near the hairline. The impedance levels were checked to be below 10Kohms.  <nl>Participants were given instructions and a practice trial first and were cued with an arrow for 35ms to let participants know which side to expect a stimulus, with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) set to 600ms-800ms in the practice trial. Different event markers were sent at stimulus onset for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli consisted of either large or small white bars shown either left or right on the screen on a black background for 50ms. The participants respond with either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. They underwent 12 practice trials including feedback about their response, before undergoing 4 blocks of 20 trials. After the practice trail was complete, the participants were given feedback on their performance.<nl>The participants were shortly warned that the real experiment was about to start. The random ISI was set to 200ms-1200ms<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>To covert the raw 9-13 Hz Alpha EEG to averaged data. Event markers from PsychoPy were sent to identify when stimuli were presented. Then looked at the period 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown. The data was rectified, which turns the negative values into positive, in order to show alpha activity regardless of it being excitatory or inhibitory. Averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of the outlying or extreme values. The rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were then suitable for statistical analysis. <nl>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics<nl>Firstly, to determine whether the data is parametric, a Shapiro-Wilk test was used and p&lt;.005. The p value is less than .05, therefore, a non-parametric equivalent had to be used: <nl>Wilcoxon signed ranks test. <nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions and a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed this difference was significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were consistent with the predicted hypothesis, as the median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left, than cue right and this supports the idea that alpha activity at P3 is different depending on which side participants are cued to expect a stimulus. <nl>The results also support previous research and the alpha inhibition hypothesis, as high alpha shows the inhibition of task irrelevant areas due to more activity in the left hemisphere (Klimesch et al., 2007), on the ipsilateral side of where the cue was presented. <nl>Although the results are consistent with the hypothesis, confounding variables may have altered the data to an extent. The participants moving around, may have altered the validity as gross motor movements may contaminate the EEG recordings, (Bell, M. A., &amp; Cuevas, K., 2012).<nl>Overall, there may be some areas for improvement to prevent confounding variables from affecting the data. To prevent motor movements, the participants should be given strict instructions to follow due to the sensitivity of the EEG. The researchers should monitor the participants to check if those instructions are being followed. However, despite these issues, the results can be granted as valid as the correct procedures were taken during the experiment, such as ensuring the impedance levels were below 10Kohms and in addition the results were expected due to previous research.", "Erm, it has impacted me in, in terms of like, maybe, snacking out of boredom.

This study will focus on the politeness strategies used by each gender when critiquing the contestants. To achieve this, it will investigate the number of lines of speech, the use of positive as opposed to negative adjectives and the use of hedges or intensifiers. A hedge is a linguistic device used to mitigate a statement by lowering epistemic modality and directness with the goal of reducing the threat to face (Salager-Meyer, 1994; Brown and Levinson, 1978.) On the other hand, an intensifier is an adverb or adverbial phrase used to give emphasis (Bolinger, 1972). <nl>The data used in this study is from The Great British Bake Off (which will from here onwards be referred to as GBBO) and MasterChef: The Professionals, which will simply be referred to as MasterChef. These two programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions, but MasterChef features professional chefs and GBBO amateur bakers. There is also a difference in formality as GBBO is more informal and light-hearted which is shown by its two presenters both being comedians. On the other hand, MasterChef is more formal in tone and takes a more serious approach. <nl>This topic has been chosen as it combines politeness theories with gender theory in order to examine how they interact with each other, applying this to a competition environment. Both of the datasets are from television shows therefore it is important to take into account that they may be edited to portray people in a certain way or to best fulfil the main purpose of the shows, which is to entertain. It will be interesting to see how this artificial environment impacts the judges as they may be inclined to be more polite than usual in order to portray themselves well on television, or less polite if their career is based on them playing a \"villain\" role.<nl><nl>Research Background <nl>There has been much debate by linguistics over the relationship between gender and language and the effect the former has on the latter. One of the seminal theorists in this subject is Robin Lakoff (1975) who suggested that there are fundamental differences in how men and women use language. Most relevant to this paper was her identified differences in the use of polite forms, with women typically using more polite forms than men. Janet Holmes (2013) also agreed that women are more likely to use polite forms, although acknowledged that there are differences depending on factors such as the context of the interaction and the specific people involved. She argued that: <nl>\"when all the necessary reservations and qualifications have been taken into account, I think the answer is \u2018yes, women are more polite than men\u2019\" (Holmes, 1995: 5). <nl>It has also been suggested that women use more polite forms as they are more powerless than men (Deuchar, 1988). One theory that supports this is the dominance theory which investigated the number of interruptions between men and women in a mixed gender conversation (Zimmerman and West, 1975). The study found that men are much more likely to interrupt than women and across the eleven conversations they recorded women interrupted only twice whereas men interrupted 46 times. This supports the idea that women are more polite than men, however the study only has a small sample size of 35 participants, all of whom were from a similar background, and is over 45 years old. <nl>Looking more closely at politeness, it can be defined as a type of communication that shows respect and gives some benefit to the other communicators (Leech, 2014). It is an act which aims to maintain the other participants\u2019 positive and negative face (Goffman, 1967). <nl>Leech\u2019s politeness principle (1983) argues that speakers must follow six maxims in order to be considered polite. The theory builds on Grice\u2019s maxims of conversation (1975) but expands these maxim\u2019s and focuses them specifically on appearing polite. These maxims of politeness are; tact, generosity, approbation, modesty and agreement. This study will focus on the maxim of approbation, which involves maximising expressions of praise and approval and lessening the expressions of dispraise. <nl>In a recent study, these maxims were applied to high school students and their interactions with teachers in order to investigate how gender influences politeness (Ningsih et al., 2020). The study used a qualitive approach and gathered data through observations and recordings. They found that both male and female students adhered to the politeness principle more strongly with female teachers than with male teachers. This could suggest that how polite a speaker is depends on the gender of the person they are speaking to more than their own gender identification. Although this study looks only at the speaker and does not take into account the gender of the addressee, this could account for some of the patterns of politeness encountered and therefore is worth taking into consideration. <nl>Looking at this previous research, it could be expected that the female judges in this study will show more behaviours associated with politeness than the male judges, which will be shown through an increase of positive adjectives and a decrease of negative adjectives. It is also expected that the female judges will more often seek to minimise the amount of dispraise given and use hedges to save the hearer\u2019s positive face, whilst using more intensifiers to emphasise praise. It is also anticipated that males will dominate the conversation more, which could be seen as impolite as they allow less room in the conversation for the female judges to speak.<nl><nl>Methodology <nl>The data used in this investigation is from the final episode of the 2020 series of GBBO and the 2020 final of MasterChef. In each episode there are three contestants remaining and so, by using the first challenge they are given in each, there are three sets of comparable data for each show. Each judgement was then transcribed using the key in appendix one. The narration in MasterChef was excluded from the transcripts as it was edited in later and therefore was not part of the conversation being analysed. This analysis only focused on the judge\u2019s communication; however, the contestants and presenter\u2019s speech were included in the transcriptions for context. <nl>These programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions and so the type of praisecriticism given is comparable. However, the difference in tone and level of formality between the programmes allows a deeper investigation into the impact of context on politeness. It will be of interest to see whether the hypothesises are realised and whether the tone and formality of each programme impacts this, and if so to what extent. These programmes were also chosen as they have mixed gender judging panels thus the impact of gender can be observed. <nl>Once the data had been collected, it was analysed using a quantitative approach. The number of lines of speech by each of the judges was counted in each extract and placed into table one. In MasterChef there were three judges, two of which were male. In order to calculate the number of lines of speech for the males, the number for each judge was added together and then divided by two. Although this removes the influence of the individual, which is a disadvantage, it allows the proportion of speech by each gender to be directly compared, which for the purposes of this investigation was deemed more important. <nl>When counting the lines of speech, each line was counted as a whole regardless of the length. However, there is one result which contains a half due to the calculation used to find the average. Speech was also counted as one line if it was transcribed across two due to interruption but the utterance carried on unbroken. <nl>The use of adjectives was also counted and placed into a table (table two) and the context of the utterance was used to determine whether an adjective was used positively as praise, or negatively to criticise. The same method was then applied to the use of hedges and intensifiers, which were then discussed in a qualitative light to determine the effect they had on the overall politeness of each statement.<nl><nl>Findings <nl>i. Amount of speech by male and female judges <nl>The following table summarises the number of lines of speech made by male and female judges in each dataset. As there were two male judges in MasterChef the average number of lines of speech made between them has been used, as mentioned in the methodology. <nl><table><nl>Looking at GBBO first, on average the male judge (Paul) utters more lines of speech than the female judge (Prue). In the judgements of contestants one and three, Paul utters eight lines of speech as opposed to Prue\u2019s six lines, an increase of 28.57%. This is befitting the hypothesis that the male judge will speak more than the female judge, however the data featuring contestant two conflicts with this. In this instance, Prue has one more line of speech than Paul which is a 22.22% difference. Overall, Paul speaks more than Prue in two of the three extracts, and in there is a greater difference between the judges when Paul is the one speaking more. Across all three extracts Paul is shown to utter 16.22% more lines of speech than Prue, conforming to the expected results. <nl>Analysing the MasterChef results, the males (Gregg and Marcus) utter more lines of speech in the judgements of contestants one and two than the female judge (Monica). In the transcript featuring contestant one there is a 40% difference in the number of utterances, and in the next there is a 22.22% difference. This is a greater increase in the amount of speech by males as opposed to females than was seen in GBBO. Yet, when the judgement of contestant three is analysed, the largest difference in speech of all the transcripts is shown with Monica speaking 66.67% more lines than the male judges. This means that overall, there is only a 3.39% difference between the male and female judges, with the female judge having uttered more lines in total. This disagrees with the hypothesis that men would talk more but the difference in utterance of lines is minimal. <nl>To conclude, the data from GBBO is in accordance with the hypothesis made that males will utter more lines of speech than females, but the data from MasterChef contradicts it. There are a few possible explanations for why this might have occurred. One explanation is the difference in tone between the two shows; In MasterChef the setting is more formal and professional whereas GBBO is a more informal setting where the judges interact with the contestants more colloquially. Therefore, GBBO mirrors normal conversations more than MasterChef and the context relates more closely to that of the studies researched for this paper. There is also a difference in the way the programmes are formatted. The judgement in GBBO is more like a conversation in the first challenge, so there are examples of turn-taking within the conversation. In contrast, on MasterChef the judges speak one at a time in longer instances and there are no conversations between them. This could influence the results as it means the participants are not dominating the conversation but rather giving a longer individual monologue. <nl>It is also of note that the extracts transcribed are only a couple of minutes long and therefore there is only a relatively small amount of data. In a longer conversation there is a possibility that the difference between male and female speech could become more defined.<nl><nl>ii. Use of adjectives <nl>When categorising the use of adjectives into positive or negative classifications, the context of the sentence was used to determine what category was most appropriate. They were then collated into the table below. <nl><table><nl>For example, \"wobbly\" was classed as a positive adjective as it was used in the utterance \"I like the wobbly lines\" (Appendix three, lines 20-22). <nl>Analysing the use of adjectives by the GBBO judges, Prue used more positive adjectives with each contestant as well as a greater range of adjectives. Looking at the use of negative adjectives, both judges used a similar number however Paul used one more. Therefore, the GBBO data aligns with the hypothesis that the female judge would use more adjectives that signal praise, and the male more negative adjectives. <nl>When comparing this to the results for the MasterChef data, Monica used an equal number of negative adjectives as Marcus, and one more than Gregg who did not use any. This contradicts the hypothesis and suggests that Monica is more willing to risk threatening the contestants face than Gregg, who only uses compliments. When judging the first contestant, Gregg used seven times as many adjectives to give praise than Monica did, and more than twice as many as Marcus. With the next contestant all three judges used the same number of positive adjectives and with the final contestant Monica used the most; using four times as many as Gregg and twice as many as Marcus. Ranking the judges based on their use of positive minus negative adjectives, Marcus and Monica both ranked the same and Gregg ranked highest meaning he is most concerned with politeness and least willing to flout the maxim of approbation. In summary, the data from MasterChef does not support the hypothesis and contrasts with the GBBO results. <nl><nl>iii. Use of hedges and intensifiers <nl>Within this table a colour-coding system has been using to differentiate between the hedges and intensifiers that have been used in relation to negative statements, and those that have been used positively. Text in green represents the words and phrases that have be used in relation to praise, and red has been used for text that relates to dispraise or criticism. <nl><table><nl>The intensifier \"very very\" was kept as one phrase within the table rather than two instances of the word \"very\" to emphasise how strongly the praise was given. <nl>The results from the analysis on hedging and intensifiers is similar to the patterns seen when investigating the use of adjectives. In the GBBO data, Prue used more positively associated hedges and intensifiers and fewer negative ones than Paul. <nl>Similarly, in the MasterChef data Gregg did not use any negative forms of these linguistic features which correlates with his use of adjectives. Although Marcus used more negative forms of the features than Monica, he also used more positive forms therefore showing they have an equal level of politeness as shown with their use of adjectives. <nl>Overall, this section again confirms that the judges in GBBO conform to the ideas of gender and politeness, whereas the judges in MasterChef do not. This could be down to the individual\u2019s character, as the social constructivist theory suggests that gender is only one part of our identity that influences communication; Personality, status, level of education and ethnicity also all serve to shape our communication (Burr, 2015). It suggests that people make each element of this construction relevant or irrelevant as is necessary. This suggests that Monica and Gregg could be choosing not to make their gender relevant to their role as judge, and each is relying on other factors to influence their use of praise instead. <nl><nl>Discussion <nl>One section that is particularly interesting is where Paul and Prue discussed the issues with Dave\u2019s custard slice in the GGBO. In the extract below, both judges use a mixture of hedges and praise to try and soften their criticism of Dave and minimise their flouting of the maxim of approbation. <nl><data_extract><nl>In cooking the adjective \"strong\" can be both positive or negative. In this extract Prue signals that she is using it positively by her use of the phrase \"I love the coffee\" before describing it as strong, thereby using it to praise Dave. The use of the intensifier \"really\" emphasises the strength of the flavour which adds to this praise. This extract also features the word \"stodgy\" three times. In the first instance, Paul used it to criticise Dave\u2019s custard which is an example of a positive face threatening act. However, Paul lessens the impact of the criticism by using the hedging phrase \"a little bit\" therefore minimising the expression of dispraise as laid out in Leech\u2019s maxim of approbation (1983). Prue then repeats this criticism however she uses the adjective \"stodgy\" twice with an emphasis on the first time. In this instance she is using the first expression of stodgy as a hedge to minimise the impact of the second expression, hereby implying it is not as bad as it could be and is only minorly stodgy. Again, this helps to minimise the impoliteness and helps to save face. \"Pretty\" is also used as a hedge in this extract, which lessens the compliment of it being \"delicious\". The use of the adverb \"still\" serves to further lessen it, so although Prue is paying a compliment, she is still acknowledging that the baking has flaws. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, the hypothesises that female judges would use more language concerned with politeness were realised to a certain extent. The patterns of communication shown by the GBBO judges did match up with what was expected, however the judges in MasterChef conformed to these expectations to a much lesser extent. This could be due to the formality of the show as opposed to the more colloquial nature of The Great British Bake Off, although it could also be due to the individual backgrounds and personalities of each judge. There is also a possibility that the gender of the contestant being judged has an impact on how the judges use politeness. Future research could investigate further by looking at a greater range of programmes and including more data for each. There is also an age difference of 35 years between the two female judges so it could be interesting to investigate deeper into how the changes in society between these years have influenced how women use language in reference to politeness.", "Dear <addr1_FN>,<nl><nl>2 Things I found useful:<nl>- Finding out how to access e-books using <system><nl>- The online referencing using the cite button<nl><nl>I will follow this up by looking at extra reading for my coursework<nl><nl>Regards,<nl><part_FN_SN><new>Dear <addr9_FN>,<nl><nl>I was looking at the power module for <module> (<module_code>), and could not find references for Impression Management Techniques or for Power techniques for influencing others.

{"id": "90b3768d-eee1-4451-8148-231a33d9fef706028", "discourse_types": ["essay", "speech_transcription"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>This paper will examine whether there is a difference in how males and females use language when in the role of competition judge, and whether the formality of the situation has an impact. This study will focus on the politeness strategies used by each gender when critiquing the contestants. To achieve this, it will investigate the number of lines of speech, the use of positive as opposed to negative adjectives and the use of hedges or intensifiers. A hedge is a linguistic device used to mitigate a statement by lowering epistemic modality and directness with the goal of reducing the threat to face (Salager-Meyer, 1994; Brown and Levinson, 1978.) On the other hand, an intensifier is an adverb or adverbial phrase used to give emphasis (Bolinger, 1972). <nl>The data used in this study is from The Great British Bake Off (which will from here onwards be referred to as GBBO) and MasterChef: The Professionals, which will simply be referred to as MasterChef. These two programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions, but MasterChef features professional chefs and GBBO amateur bakers. There is also a difference in formality as GBBO is more informal and light-hearted which is shown by its two presenters both being comedians. On the other hand, MasterChef is more formal in tone and takes a more serious approach. <nl>This topic has been chosen as it combines politeness theories with gender theory in order to examine how they interact with each other, applying this to a competition environment. Both of the datasets are from television shows therefore it is important to take into account that they may be edited to portray people in a certain way or to best fulfil the main purpose of the shows, which is to entertain. It will be interesting to see how this artificial environment impacts the judges as they may be inclined to be more polite than usual in order to portray themselves well on television, or less polite if their career is based on them playing a \"villain\" role.<nl><nl>Research Background <nl>There has been much debate by linguistics over the relationship between gender and language and the effect the former has on the latter. One of the seminal theorists in this subject is Robin Lakoff (1975) who suggested that there are fundamental differences in how men and women use language. Most relevant to this paper was her identified differences in the use of polite forms, with women typically using more polite forms than men. Janet Holmes (2013) also agreed that women are more likely to use polite forms, although acknowledged that there are differences depending on factors such as the context of the interaction and the specific people involved. She argued that: <nl>\"when all the necessary reservations and qualifications have been taken into account, I think the answer is \u2018yes, women are more polite than men\u2019\" (Holmes, 1995: 5). <nl>It has also been suggested that women use more polite forms as they are more powerless than men (Deuchar, 1988). One theory that supports this is the dominance theory which investigated the number of interruptions between men and women in a mixed gender conversation (Zimmerman and West, 1975). The study found that men are much more likely to interrupt than women and across the eleven conversations they recorded women interrupted only twice whereas men interrupted 46 times. This supports the idea that women are more polite than men, however the study only has a small sample size of 35 participants, all of whom were from a similar background, and is over 45 years old. <nl>Looking more closely at politeness, it can be defined as a type of communication that shows respect and gives some benefit to the other communicators (Leech, 2014). It is an act which aims to maintain the other participants\u2019 positive and negative face (Goffman, 1967). <nl>Leech\u2019s politeness principle (1983) argues that speakers must follow six maxims in order to be considered polite. The theory builds on Grice\u2019s maxims of conversation (1975) but expands these maxim\u2019s and focuses them specifically on appearing polite. These maxims of politeness are; tact, generosity, approbation, modesty and agreement. This study will focus on the maxim of approbation, which involves maximising expressions of praise and approval and lessening the expressions of dispraise. <nl>In a recent study, these maxims were applied to high school students and their interactions with teachers in order to investigate how gender influences politeness (Ningsih et al., 2020). The study used a qualitive approach and gathered data through observations and recordings. They found that both male and female students adhered to the politeness principle more strongly with female teachers than with male teachers. This could suggest that how polite a speaker is depends on the gender of the person they are speaking to more than their own gender identification. Although this study looks only at the speaker and does not take into account the gender of the addressee, this could account for some of the patterns of politeness encountered and therefore is worth taking into consideration. <nl>Looking at this previous research, it could be expected that the female judges in this study will show more behaviours associated with politeness than the male judges, which will be shown through an increase of positive adjectives and a decrease of negative adjectives. It is also expected that the female judges will more often seek to minimise the amount of dispraise given and use hedges to save the hearer\u2019s positive face, whilst using more intensifiers to emphasise praise. It is also anticipated that males will dominate the conversation more, which could be seen as impolite as they allow less room in the conversation for the female judges to speak.<nl><nl>Methodology <nl>The data used in this investigation is from the final episode of the 2020 series of GBBO and the 2020 final of MasterChef. In each episode there are three contestants remaining and so, by using the first challenge they are given in each, there are three sets of comparable data for each show. Each judgement was then transcribed using the key in appendix one. The narration in MasterChef was excluded from the transcripts as it was edited in later and therefore was not part of the conversation being analysed. This analysis only focused on the judge\u2019s communication; however, the contestants and presenter\u2019s speech were included in the transcriptions for context. <nl>These programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions and so the type of praisecriticism given is comparable. However, the difference in tone and level of formality between the programmes allows a deeper investigation into the impact of context on politeness. It will be of interest to see whether the hypothesises are realised and whether the tone and formality of each programme impacts this, and if so to what extent. These programmes were also chosen as they have mixed gender judging panels thus the impact of gender can be observed. <nl>Once the data had been collected, it was analysed using a quantitative approach. The number of lines of speech by each of the judges was counted in each extract and placed into table one. In MasterChef there were three judges, two of which were male. In order to calculate the number of lines of speech for the males, the number for each judge was added together and then divided by two. Although this removes the influence of the individual, which is a disadvantage, it allows the proportion of speech by each gender to be directly compared, which for the purposes of this investigation was deemed more important. <nl>When counting the lines of speech, each line was counted as a whole regardless of the length. However, there is one result which contains a half due to the calculation used to find the average. Speech was also counted as one line if it was transcribed across two due to interruption but the utterance carried on unbroken. <nl>The use of adjectives was also counted and placed into a table (table two) and the context of the utterance was used to determine whether an adjective was used positively as praise, or negatively to criticise. The same method was then applied to the use of hedges and intensifiers, which were then discussed in a qualitative light to determine the effect they had on the overall politeness of each statement.<nl><nl>Findings <nl>i. Amount of speech by male and female judges <nl>The following table summarises the number of lines of speech made by male and female judges in each dataset. As there were two male judges in MasterChef the average number of lines of speech made between them has been used, as mentioned in the methodology. <nl><table><nl>Looking at GBBO first, on average the male judge (Paul) utters more lines of speech than the female judge (Prue). In the judgements of contestants one and three, Paul utters eight lines of speech as opposed to Prue\u2019s six lines, an increase of 28.57%. This is befitting the hypothesis that the male judge will speak more than the female judge, however the data featuring contestant two conflicts with this. In this instance, Prue has one more line of speech than Paul which is a 22.22% difference. Overall, Paul speaks more than Prue in two of the three extracts, and in there is a greater difference between the judges when Paul is the one speaking more. Across all three extracts Paul is shown to utter 16.22% more lines of speech than Prue, conforming to the expected results. <nl>Analysing the MasterChef results, the males (Gregg and Marcus) utter more lines of speech in the judgements of contestants one and two than the female judge (Monica). In the transcript featuring contestant one there is a 40% difference in the number of utterances, and in the next there is a 22.22% difference. This is a greater increase in the amount of speech by males as opposed to females than was seen in GBBO. Yet, when the judgement of contestant three is analysed, the largest difference in speech of all the transcripts is shown with Monica speaking 66.67% more lines than the male judges. This means that overall, there is only a 3.39% difference between the male and female judges, with the female judge having uttered more lines in total. This disagrees with the hypothesis that men would talk more but the difference in utterance of lines is minimal. <nl>To conclude, the data from GBBO is in accordance with the hypothesis made that males will utter more lines of speech than females, but the data from MasterChef contradicts it. There are a few possible explanations for why this might have occurred. One explanation is the difference in tone between the two shows; In MasterChef the setting is more formal and professional whereas GBBO is a more informal setting where the judges interact with the contestants more colloquially. Therefore, GBBO mirrors normal conversations more than MasterChef and the context relates more closely to that of the studies researched for this paper. There is also a difference in the way the programmes are formatted. The judgement in GBBO is more like a conversation in the first challenge, so there are examples of turn-taking within the conversation. In contrast, on MasterChef the judges speak one at a time in longer instances and there are no conversations between them. This could influence the results as it means the participants are not dominating the conversation but rather giving a longer individual monologue. <nl>It is also of note that the extracts transcribed are only a couple of minutes long and therefore there is only a relatively small amount of data. In a longer conversation there is a possibility that the difference between male and female speech could become more defined.<nl><nl>ii. Use of adjectives <nl>When categorising the use of adjectives into positive or negative classifications, the context of the sentence was used to determine what category was most appropriate. They were then collated into the table below. <nl><table><nl>For example, \"wobbly\" was classed as a positive adjective as it was used in the utterance \"I like the wobbly lines\" (Appendix three, lines 20-22). <nl>Analysing the use of adjectives by the GBBO judges, Prue used more positive adjectives with each contestant as well as a greater range of adjectives. Looking at the use of negative adjectives, both judges used a similar number however Paul used one more. Therefore, the GBBO data aligns with the hypothesis that the female judge would use more adjectives that signal praise, and the male more negative adjectives. <nl>When comparing this to the results for the MasterChef data, Monica used an equal number of negative adjectives as Marcus, and one more than Gregg who did not use any. This contradicts the hypothesis and suggests that Monica is more willing to risk threatening the contestants face than Gregg, who only uses compliments. When judging the first contestant, Gregg used seven times as many adjectives to give praise than Monica did, and more than twice as many as Marcus. With the next contestant all three judges used the same number of positive adjectives and with the final contestant Monica used the most; using four times as many as Gregg and twice as many as Marcus. Ranking the judges based on their use of positive minus negative adjectives, Marcus and Monica both ranked the same and Gregg ranked highest meaning he is most concerned with politeness and least willing to flout the maxim of approbation. In summary, the data from MasterChef does not support the hypothesis and contrasts with the GBBO results. <nl><nl>iii. Use of hedges and intensifiers <nl>Within this table a colour-coding system has been using to differentiate between the hedges and intensifiers that have been used in relation to negative statements, and those that have been used positively. Text in green represents the words and phrases that have be used in relation to praise, and red has been used for text that relates to dispraise or criticism. <nl><table><nl>The intensifier \"very very\" was kept as one phrase within the table rather than two instances of the word \"very\" to emphasise how strongly the praise was given. <nl>The results from the analysis on hedging and intensifiers is similar to the patterns seen when investigating the use of adjectives. In the GBBO data, Prue used more positively associated hedges and intensifiers and fewer negative ones than Paul. <nl>Similarly, in the MasterChef data Gregg did not use any negative forms of these linguistic features which correlates with his use of adjectives. Although Marcus used more negative forms of the features than Monica, he also used more positive forms therefore showing they have an equal level of politeness as shown with their use of adjectives. <nl>Overall, this section again confirms that the judges in GBBO conform to the ideas of gender and politeness, whereas the judges in MasterChef do not. This could be down to the individual\u2019s character, as the social constructivist theory suggests that gender is only one part of our identity that influences communication; Personality, status, level of education and ethnicity also all serve to shape our communication (Burr, 2015). It suggests that people make each element of this construction relevant or irrelevant as is necessary. This suggests that Monica and Gregg could be choosing not to make their gender relevant to their role as judge, and each is relying on other factors to influence their use of praise instead. <nl><nl>Discussion <nl>One section that is particularly interesting is where Paul and Prue discussed the issues with Dave\u2019s custard slice in the GGBO. In the extract below, both judges use a mixture of hedges and praise to try and soften their criticism of Dave and minimise their flouting of the maxim of approbation. <nl><data_extract><nl>In cooking the adjective \"strong\" can be both positive or negative. In this extract Prue signals that she is using it positively by her use of the phrase \"I love the coffee\" before describing it as strong, thereby using it to praise Dave. The use of the intensifier \"really\" emphasises the strength of the flavour which adds to this praise. This extract also features the word \"stodgy\" three times. In the first instance, Paul used it to criticise Dave\u2019s custard which is an example of a positive face threatening act. However, Paul lessens the impact of the criticism by using the hedging phrase \"a little bit\" therefore minimising the expression of dispraise as laid out in Leech\u2019s maxim of approbation (1983). Prue then repeats this criticism however she uses the adjective \"stodgy\" twice with an emphasis on the first time. In this instance she is using the first expression of stodgy as a hedge to minimise the impact of the second expression, hereby implying it is not as bad as it could be and is only minorly stodgy. Again, this helps to minimise the impoliteness and helps to save face. \"Pretty\" is also used as a hedge in this extract, which lessens the compliment of it being \"delicious\". The use of the adverb \"still\" serves to further lessen it, so although Prue is paying a compliment, she is still acknowledging that the baking has flaws. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, the hypothesises that female judges would use more language concerned with politeness were realised to a certain extent. The patterns of communication shown by the GBBO judges did match up with what was expected, however the judges in MasterChef conformed to these expectations to a much lesser extent. This could be due to the formality of the show as opposed to the more colloquial nature of The Great British Bake Off, although it could also be due to the individual backgrounds and personalities of each judge. There is also a possibility that the gender of the contestant being judged has an impact on how the judges use politeness. Future research could investigate further by looking at a greater range of programmes and including more data for each. There is also an age difference of 35 years between the two female judges so it could be interesting to investigate deeper into how the changes in society between these years have influenced how women use language in reference to politeness.", "Okay, so picture one, erm, has got two women in it. One is standing up and leaning over a little bit. She is wearing a black and white stripey t-shirt and some jeans, and then sat down next to her is another girl in a leather jacket \u2013 not a leather jacket, a denim jacket. Erm, she, the girl sitting down, is laughing. And the woman standing up is smiling a little bit, but she\u2019s not looking directly at her. Erm, maybe they\u2019re looking at something together, but that\u2019s not in the picture. The picture is just the girls. The background is just plain white. Erm, there might be some shapes underneath it, I can\u2019t really see. But for the most part it\u2019s either white or blocked out, so the focus of the picture is the girls. Erm, they look like maybe they\u2019re friends or maybe they\u2019re in a study group together, like they could be students. They look about student age. I\u2019d say like early twenties kind of age. And yeah, that\u2019s the first image. The second picture has got two boys in it, and the fo- the main, at the front of the picture is a laptop, is an Apple MacBook. Erm, and the background is, I think they\u2019re in like a study booth, maybe. Erm, there\u2019s a table at the front, and then the back is like black with green spots on it, different sizes, dots. And then one of the boys is wearing a t-shirt with flowers on it and pink writing, and he\u2019s got an earring in. And the other boy is wearing like a, I think it\u2019s like plaid or flannel, or whatever, a shirt over a white t-shirt. And he is looking at the laptop, and the other boy is looking at him. Again, I think students, in probably a study session. I think they might be in a study group together. They both ar- they seem happy to be there,  <laugh>  I don\u2019t know, kind of not outwardly smiling but a bit of a smile. Erm, seems like they get on, but I don\u2019t know if I would say, they don\u2019t really look like best friends I would say. So maybe they\u2019ve met in a study group, or maybe they\u2019re just acquaintances, I don\u2019t know. And then the third picture is, I guess again might be a study situation, because there\u2019s a boy in it holding a book that looks, it\u2019s quite a thick book, so maybe a textbook. Erm, they, there\u2019s a table at the front, like a glass table, and they\u2019re both sat, there are two people in it, both sat on a bench, I think? Erm, sorry, this one\u2019s a boy and a girl. The boy is holding a textbook and he\u2019s got a coat on, and some, I don\u2019t know, he\u2019s, I don\u2019t know. The girl has got her leather jacket on and some boots, and the background is, erm, is black with white dots making up the circle, and then a bigger circle, bigger circle, etc., etc. Erm, and maybe like I said also in a study session, erm, kind of setting, like students. They\u2019re both looking at someone else who\u2019s not in the picture, although there is a hand, so I guess that\u2019s the person\u2019s hand. And they\u2019re both looking quite at them, not each other. So I guess that person\u2019s speaking and they\u2019re both listening. Again they\u2019re both smiling, so obviously comfortable in the situation. Erm, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know about their relationship. That\u2019s not really clear in the picture, whether they\u2019re friends or just been again put together as part of maybe a project or something. And yeah, is that enough?"]}

It is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued left than when cued right. Data from 38 participants was used. Within-subjects design. Independent variable had two levels: cue left, cue right. Dependant variable was the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V). EEG electrodes were attached to relevant areas using the 1020 system. The results showed that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions. The results are consistent with the hypothesis and previous research.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>The alpha inhibition hypothesis refers to the concept that high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha wave in the relaxation state has higher power spectrum than in the attention state. Yaomanee, K., Pan-ngum, S., &amp; Ayuthaya, P. I. N. (2012). Concluding that alpha activity can be modulated by attention, thus meaning that alpha activity is reduced when we pay attention to stimuli.<nl>This experiment is a partial replication of Sauseng et al., (2005). Overall, 22 participants used, and they were given a cued visual attention task. Cued with a fixation cross for 34ms, then an arrow cue would indicate which hemifield a target would appear in. There was a 50% chance of being cued left or right, 75% of the trials were valid and 25% of trials were invalid. Results indicated that parietal regions showed stronger alpha lower band frequency suppression contralateral to the attended hemifield. Similar results for upper frequencies. Therefore, the alpha inhibition hypothesis is supported by these findings as there is stronger alpha activity in the task irrelevant brain areas. <nl>To further support these findings, Mazahari et al., (2014) used 57 adolescent participants: 23 normally developing, 17 who have combined subtype ADHD (inattention and hyperactivity) and 17 who have predominantly inattentive ADHD. Used a cued flanker task. Response preparation cue predicted 84% accuracy, or a null cue was shown which had no information about correct response. Overall participants showed alpha suppression following response preparation cues, greater for normally developing participants and least for inattentive ADHD subtypes. The indicative alpha suppression supports the idea that alpha activity can be modulated by attention \u2013 thus being reduced when participants attended to the stimuli.<nl>Following on previous studies, it is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued to expect a stimulus on the left than when cued to expect a stimulus on the right, when recording from the left parietal lobe (P3).  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>To begin with, 39 undergraduate participants were obtained by volunteer sample, however, one participant was removed as they were only available for one of the two conditions: 38 participants overall. <nl>Design <nl>Within subject\u2019s design, with an independent variable of cue direction with two levels: either left or right. The dependent variable is the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V).<nl><nl>Materials <nl>A Biopac MP36 was used to record alpha range activity and receive event markers for cue left and cue right conditions. EEG electrodes which were attached to the head. AC Cream and Everi cream was used, in preparation prior to the attachment of electrodes. The software PsychoPy was used to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. Stimuli were used to present to the visual fields such as: arrow cues left (&lt;) and right (&gt;), large bar (Figure A) and small bar (Figure B) stimuli. <nl><figure><nl> <nl>Procedure <nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz. Digital channels were set up to receive the event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker. A calculation channel was also set up to record the activity in the alpha frequency range of (8 - 13 Hz). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. <nl>Before preparing the participants, they gave informed consent and were briefed on their right to withdraw from the experiment. To prepare the participants for electrode placement, Everi cream was used to abrase the areas P3, Fz and forehead, selected using the 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Techologies, 2012). The AC cream was then applied on the electrodes: an active electrode was attached to P3. Reference electrodes are attached at Fz. Earth electrodes were attached to the forehead, near the hairline. The impedance levels were checked to be below 10Kohms.  <nl>Participants were given instructions and a practice trial first and were cued with an arrow for 35ms to let participants know which side to expect a stimulus, with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) set to 600ms-800ms in the practice trial. Different event markers were sent at stimulus onset for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli consisted of either large or small white bars shown either left or right on the screen on a black background for 50ms. The participants respond with either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. They underwent 12 practice trials including feedback about their response, before undergoing 4 blocks of 20 trials. After the practice trail was complete, the participants were given feedback on their performance.<nl>The participants were shortly warned that the real experiment was about to start. The random ISI was set to 200ms-1200ms<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>To covert the raw 9-13 Hz Alpha EEG to averaged data. Event markers from PsychoPy were sent to identify when stimuli were presented. Then looked at the period 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown. The data was rectified, which turns the negative values into positive, in order to show alpha activity regardless of it being excitatory or inhibitory. Averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of the outlying or extreme values. The rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were then suitable for statistical analysis. <nl>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics<nl>Firstly, to determine whether the data is parametric, a Shapiro-Wilk test was used and p&lt;.005. The p value is less than .05, therefore, a non-parametric equivalent had to be used: <nl>Wilcoxon signed ranks test. <nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions and a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed this difference was significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were consistent with the predicted hypothesis, as the median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left, than cue right and this supports the idea that alpha activity at P3 is different depending on which side participants are cued to expect a stimulus. <nl>The results also support previous research and the alpha inhibition hypothesis, as high alpha shows the inhibition of task irrelevant areas due to more activity in the left hemisphere (Klimesch et al., 2007), on the ipsilateral side of where the cue was presented. <nl>Although the results are consistent with the hypothesis, confounding variables may have altered the data to an extent. The participants moving around, may have altered the validity as gross motor movements may contaminate the EEG recordings, (Bell, M. A., &amp; Cuevas, K., 2012).<nl>Overall, there may be some areas for improvement to prevent confounding variables from affecting the data. To prevent motor movements, the participants should be given strict instructions to follow due to the sensitivity of the EEG. The researchers should monitor the participants to check if those instructions are being followed. However, despite these issues, the results can be granted as valid as the correct procedures were taken during the experiment, such as ensuring the impedance levels were below 10Kohms and in addition the results were expected due to previous research.", " Okay.

The dependent variable was the proportion of correctly identified responses (PCR) after corrected false recognition presented in decimal factors (a number between 0-1).<nl> <nl>Materials  <nl>The materials that were used were four lists of 30 words from the Toronto Word Pool (Friendly, Franklin, Hoffman, &amp; Rubin, 1982) and a metronome to measure the response time in seconds. <nl> <nl>Procedure  <nl>Firstly, the researchers obtained an informed consent from all the participants. After, the participants were shown a list of 30 words before they were given a word recognition task where the 30 previously seen targets were presented with 30 previously unseen words. Words were moderately concrete, low imageability words. Four lists of 30 words were used, participants were asked to complete a mental arithmetic task between study and recognition stages. After, the participants had completed two consecutive word recognition tasks. One of the task on their own and one concurrently with a finger tapping task, this time they had to keep time with a metronome. Latin square was used to change the order in which the participants completed the dual and single tasks.<nl>Results <nl><nl>Main effect of age group<nl>Table 1. showed the mean recall for the young group was the highest compared to the mean of young-old and old-old.

Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001)."]}

Erm, but yeah, I think it changed drastically. And, obviously, I\u2019ve been working throughout, erm, the whole pandemic so, erm, work has influenced me like to, to eat slightly less in the day. Erm, like, for example, obviously, I wouldn\u2019t have my lunch so my lunch would be combined into dinner and, you know, erm, evening meal kind of thing. So, yeah, it hasn\u2019t really influmen-, influenced me a lot. Maybe it\u2019s influenced me in terms of the fact that I\u2019ve done working so I have not been eating as much. But yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it.<new>Erm, I don\u2019t have a particular food that I hate but I hate an ingredient in food and it\u2019s ginger. I just can\u2019t stand the taste of it. Anything that has ginger in it, like, for example, if I\u2019m, if I\u2019m going to like an Asian restaurant, erm, and they have, it has ginger, it just ruins the whole meal for me. I think it\u2019s t-, way too overpowering and I just don\u2019t understand how people can enjoy it, really. I just, personally, I can\u2019t stomach ginger. It makes me, psh, just makes me feel ill.<new>Erm, mm. Let me think. I think it would be a jackfruit. I think that\u2019s what they\u2019re called. Erm, I think it\u2019s like an Asian kind of, erm, it\u2019s like a huge. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s Asian or just gen-, like generally kind of like an exotic fruit. Erm, but it\u2019s like a huge, green, like spikey kind of melon looking thing but, obviously, when you cut inside of it, then there\u2019s like a huge, strong smell of like rotting like, rotten fruit, basically. But it has a really, really sweet taste, which is really strange. Erm, I tasted some at my friend\u2019s house one time and I could never forget about it, honestly.

Lastly, another cognitive change that is observed is that the individuals affected by PTSD may lose interest in activities or avoid participating in them. These might be the activities that they enjoyed before the event occurred. <nl><nl>One of the biological changes observed is that the hippocampus is significantly smaller in individuals who develop PTSD. This region of the brain plays a role in memories related to emotion, therefore a smaller hippocampus represents a higher risk for developing PTSD after a traumatic event (Gilbertson 2002). Another biological change that is observed is the failure of the brain centres (e.g ventromedial frontal cortex) which dampens the activation of the brain's fear coordinating centre, the amygdala (Koenigs &amp; Grafman 2009). Therefore, the individual is unable to control the activation of fear after trauma."]}

Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001)."]}

Like I have u-, I used to go to the gym but, erm, not that often. Erm, so, when I joined the gym, I started eating a lot more just because I\u2019m trying to put weight on, \u2018cause, obviously, I, I\u2019ve always had around two big meals a day or like, erm, two, three small meals a day. It\u2019s, I\u2019ve never been a big eater, it\u2019s just personally the way I am, it\u2019s not because I don\u2019t have an appetite, I just don\u2019t find the time to do it. Erm, but yeah, I think it changed drastically. And, obviously, I\u2019ve been working throughout, erm, the whole pandemic so, erm, work has influenced me like to, to eat slightly less in the day. Erm, like, for example, obviously, I wouldn\u2019t have my lunch so my lunch would be combined into dinner and, you know, erm, evening meal kind of thing. So, yeah, it hasn\u2019t really influmen-, influenced me a lot. Maybe it\u2019s influenced me in terms of the fact that I\u2019ve done working so I have not been eating as much.

Anything that has ginger in it, like, for example, if I\u2019m, if I\u2019m going to like an Asian restaurant, erm, and they have, it has ginger, it just ruins the whole meal for me.

It\u2019s, it was so strange, it was a real experience.", "Unipolar depression is a form of major depression, this is when the patient focuses on negative emotions. Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001)."]}

It is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued left than when cued right. Data from 38 participants was used. Within-subjects design. Independent variable had two levels: cue left, cue right. Dependant variable was the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V). EEG electrodes were attached to relevant areas using the 1020 system. The results showed that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions. The results are consistent with the hypothesis and previous research.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>The alpha inhibition hypothesis refers to the concept that high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha wave in the relaxation state has higher power spectrum than in the attention state. Yaomanee, K., Pan-ngum, S., &amp; Ayuthaya, P. I. N. (2012). Concluding that alpha activity can be modulated by attention, thus meaning that alpha activity is reduced when we pay attention to stimuli.<nl>This experiment is a partial replication of Sauseng et al., (2005). Overall, 22 participants used, and they were given a cued visual attention task. Cued with a fixation cross for 34ms, then an arrow cue would indicate which hemifield a target would appear in. There was a 50% chance of being cued left or right, 75% of the trials were valid and 25% of trials were invalid. Results indicated that parietal regions showed stronger alpha lower band frequency suppression contralateral to the attended hemifield. Similar results for upper frequencies. Therefore, the alpha inhibition hypothesis is supported by these findings as there is stronger alpha activity in the task irrelevant brain areas. <nl>To further support these findings, Mazahari et al., (2014) used 57 adolescent participants: 23 normally developing, 17 who have combined subtype ADHD (inattention and hyperactivity) and 17 who have predominantly inattentive ADHD. Used a cued flanker task. Response preparation cue predicted 84% accuracy, or a null cue was shown which had no information about correct response. Overall participants showed alpha suppression following response preparation cues, greater for normally developing participants and least for inattentive ADHD subtypes. The indicative alpha suppression supports the idea that alpha activity can be modulated by attention \u2013 thus being reduced when participants attended to the stimuli.<nl>Following on previous studies, it is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued to expect a stimulus on the left than when cued to expect a stimulus on the right, when recording from the left parietal lobe (P3).  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>To begin with, 39 undergraduate participants were obtained by volunteer sample, however, one participant was removed as they were only available for one of the two conditions: 38 participants overall. <nl>Design <nl>Within subject\u2019s design, with an independent variable of cue direction with two levels: either left or right. The dependent variable is the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V).<nl><nl>Materials <nl>A Biopac MP36 was used to record alpha range activity and receive event markers for cue left and cue right conditions. EEG electrodes which were attached to the head. AC Cream and Everi cream was used, in preparation prior to the attachment of electrodes. The software PsychoPy was used to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. Stimuli were used to present to the visual fields such as: arrow cues left (&lt;) and right (&gt;), large bar (Figure A) and small bar (Figure B) stimuli. <nl><figure><nl> <nl>Procedure <nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz. Digital channels were set up to receive the event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker. A calculation channel was also set up to record the activity in the alpha frequency range of (8 - 13 Hz). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. <nl>Before preparing the participants, they gave informed consent and were briefed on their right to withdraw from the experiment. To prepare the participants for electrode placement, Everi cream was used to abrase the areas P3, Fz and forehead, selected using the 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Techologies, 2012). The AC cream was then applied on the electrodes: an active electrode was attached to P3. Reference electrodes are attached at Fz. Earth electrodes were attached to the forehead, near the hairline. The impedance levels were checked to be below 10Kohms.  <nl>Participants were given instructions and a practice trial first and were cued with an arrow for 35ms to let participants know which side to expect a stimulus, with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) set to 600ms-800ms in the practice trial. Different event markers were sent at stimulus onset for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli consisted of either large or small white bars shown either left or right on the screen on a black background for 50ms. The participants respond with either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. They underwent 12 practice trials including feedback about their response, before undergoing 4 blocks of 20 trials. After the practice trail was complete, the participants were given feedback on their performance.<nl>The participants were shortly warned that the real experiment was about to start. The random ISI was set to 200ms-1200ms<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>To covert the raw 9-13 Hz Alpha EEG to averaged data. Event markers from PsychoPy were sent to identify when stimuli were presented. Then looked at the period 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown. The data was rectified, which turns the negative values into positive, in order to show alpha activity regardless of it being excitatory or inhibitory. Averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of the outlying or extreme values. The rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were then suitable for statistical analysis. <nl>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics<nl>Firstly, to determine whether the data is parametric, a Shapiro-Wilk test was used and p&lt;.005. The p value is less than .05, therefore, a non-parametric equivalent had to be used: <nl>Wilcoxon signed ranks test. <nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions and a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed this difference was significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were consistent with the predicted hypothesis, as the median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left, than cue right and this supports the idea that alpha activity at P3 is different depending on which side participants are cued to expect a stimulus. <nl>The results also support previous research and the alpha inhibition hypothesis, as high alpha shows the inhibition of task irrelevant areas due to more activity in the left hemisphere (Klimesch et al., 2007), on the ipsilateral side of where the cue was presented. <nl>Although the results are consistent with the hypothesis, confounding variables may have altered the data to an extent. The participants moving around, may have altered the validity as gross motor movements may contaminate the EEG recordings, (Bell, M. A., &amp; Cuevas, K., 2012).<nl>Overall, there may be some areas for improvement to prevent confounding variables from affecting the data. To prevent motor movements, the participants should be given strict instructions to follow due to the sensitivity of the EEG. The researchers should monitor the participants to check if those instructions are being followed. However, despite these issues, the results can be granted as valid as the correct procedures were taken during the experiment, such as ensuring the impedance levels were below 10Kohms and in addition the results were expected due to previous research.", "Erm, what a hard question.<new>Erm, I think I want to say, erm, obviously, I\u2019m half  <country1_adj>  so, erm, when I go back and I, that\u2019s not often, erm, we always tend to kind of have big meals, like, or like celebrate like Christmas or like, for example...<new><unintelligible>  grown up there.<new>Yeah, I hear you, that\u2019s fine.<new>Yeah, so I\u2019m half  <country1_adj>  so, obviously, I have, I haven\u2019t, I don\u2019t go there and like I wasn\u2019t, erm, you know, raised there or anything.

Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent (CI) than the colour congruent (CC) condition. (M= 966.8, SD= 405.1). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( T= 403, n= 59, p= &lt; .001). Data shows that participants took longer to correctly identify the font colours when they were incongruent with the colour of the words written. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>The results that were found were consistent with previous research of Stroop (1935) and supported the hypothesis as participants did have a slower reaction time when identifying incongruent font colours and had a faster reaction time for the congruent condition. The reaction time was faster for the congruent condition because Cattell (1886) argued that wording reading is automatic therefore it\u2019s quicker for individuals to read the word represented to them in that condition. However, different research finding has been reported from a similar stroop task called emotional stroop (Williams et al. 1996). It was found that the emotional Stroop involves only emotional and neutral words and that color does not affect reaction time because it does not conflict with word meaning. The classic stroop test shows that the reaction time is slower because there is a conflict between an incongruent color and the word. Furthermore,  Salthouse and Meinz (1995) argue that even though age differences specific to stroop interference were minimal, other research may show the relationship between age and Stroop interference was still significant (West &amp; Baylis, 1998). <nl><nl>Finally, some of the methodological issues regarding the experiment were that volunteer sampling was used, only university students participated. Findings cannot be generalised to those who did not volunteer and the finding may not be representative of the whole population. An improvement could be made by selecting people of all ages not just university students. Another issue was that the experiment was not completed in a controlled environment, this means they could have had help from others. Another improvement could be that all the participants complete the test in a psychology lab. Also there may have been extraneous variables which may have affected the results, e.g. some participants may have completed at 9am, they would most likely been tired and have had a slower reaction time. This can be improved by making sure all students complete the test at the same time."]}

This might include an increase in negative emotions and the inability to experience positive ones. For instance, if a woman was sexually abused, she might experience anxiety or fear even after her abuse. A second cognitive change might be a severe lack of interest in activities. The women might have enjoyed spending time with her friends prior to her abuse but after the abuse she might resist and avoid any involvement in activities that were once pleasurable to her. She may also blame herself for getting sexually abused. Her choice of wearing a scandalous outfit might justify why someone abused her and this would be another cognitive change.<nl><nl>There are also biological changes associated with PTSD. The amygdala is responsible for the perception of emotions and the ventromedial frontal cortex is responsible for regulating responses to emotions. However, the frontal region with those who have PTSD does not function effectively and it does not dampen down the amygdala to the same degree as it does with people without the disorder. Another biological change may be a decrease in the size of the hippocampus, and this might explain why people with PTSD have difficulties consolidating their memories.<nl><nl><nl>Question 2: Outline the proposed role of operant conditioning in obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD).  How would a behavioural therapist treat OCD? (Both parts of this question are equally weighted). <nl><nl>Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) is made up of two components, obsessions and compulsions. The compulsion refers to the repetitive behaviour, for example, suffers may regularly wash their hands to reduce anxiety. The anxiety is caused by obsessive, irrational thoughts for example, the constant fear of germs and bacteria. According to the second stage of Mowrer\u2019s (1947) two stage theory, the removal of an aversive stimulus will negatively reinforce behaviour. In other words, the removal of anxiety is caused by the compulsive acts of washing hands \u2013 negative reinforcement and the relief from the anxiety might be rewarding to a sufferer \u2013 positive reinforcement. Thus, the behaviour will perpetuate because it is both negatively and positively reinforced.<nl><nl>Behavioural therapists treat OCD using cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT involves the therapist and sufferer to actively break down and challenge irrational thoughts and behaviours through exposure and response prevention (ERP). This involves the gradual exposure to the feared object, this might be a fear of dirt and individuals are counter conditioned to learn new ways to control their compulsive behaviours around the fear. Once the fear is mastered, they will adopt these changes into their daily routine and try overcome their disorder.<nl><nl>Section B<nl>Critically evaluate the concept of dependence as an explanation for substance use.<nl>Dependence is an explanation for substance use and it refers to the need for drugs in order to function and in absence of the drugs, individuals may display withdrawal symptoms. There are two types of dependence, physical and mental. Mental dependence is when the use of a substance leads to a conditioned response to an emotion or feeling. For example, someone suffering from depression might rely heavily on benzodiazepines to evoke positive emotions such as relaxation and avoid withdrawal symptoms. Unfortunately, this could lead to drug misuse and the dependence explanation has helped lead to practical applications to avoid this occurring. For instance, doctors will prescribe benzodiazepines only in serious cases and for less than 4 weeks to avoid dependencyaddiction. This explanation has led to a greater understanding about drugs and positive social changes.<nl><nl>The dependence explanation is limited however, because substance use could also be a result of genetic predispositions. Kendler &amp; Prescott (1998) support this notion through their research on 1,934 twins, ranging in age from 22 to 62. They were given interviews about their drug addictions to cocaine and marijuana. Kendler reported that whilst examining pairs, it was evident that the concordance rates for both twins using drugs was higher in monozygotic (MZ) twins than dizygotic (DZ) twins. The concordance rate for cocaine use in MZ twins was 54% and in DZ twins it was 42%. Thus, this gives weight to the influence of genetics on substance use. While it is important to understand the role of heredity on substance use, environmental factors are also as important. These factors may include stress, trauma, or community pressure. Exposure to trauma has been linked closely to substance use. Witnessing death or experiencing assault would be a traumatic experience and these people are more likely to take drugs. This may be because trauma symptoms may become more manageable after self-medicating. Turning to drugs may be the easier escape for some individuals when dealing with environmental difficulties. Thus, substance use may be a result of genetic and environmental factors interacting so therefore, a diathesis stress model should be proposed.<nl><nl>Behaviourists stress the important role operant conditioning has on behaviour. Operant conditioning as proposed by Skinner (1938) can be applied to substance use. For instance, people suffering from trauma may use drugs as a coping mechanism to alleviate their trauma related symptoms (this might include shocks and mood swings). Skinner referred to negative reinforcement as the continual of behaviour to remove any aversive outcomes. Similarly, individuals might repeat the act of taking drugs because it temporarily removes their symptoms. Another concept of operant conditioning is positive reinforcement. This refers to the continual of behaviour to gain a reward. Drugs are involved in the activation of dopamine pathways. These pathways stimulate pleasure and reward thus might also explain why people continue to take drugs. Therefore, the dependent explanation can not alone explain substance use as a variety of factors and explanations might account for it.", "Hello, I saw the <job_title> job (<business> within <location>) and I would like to apply.

{"id": "3d0841b8-5a52-497e-af07-45245ffe8b6500200", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>This paper will examine whether there is a difference in how males and females use language when in the role of competition judge, and whether the formality of the situation has an impact. This study will focus on the politeness strategies used by each gender when critiquing the contestants. To achieve this, it will investigate the number of lines of speech, the use of positive as opposed to negative adjectives and the use of hedges or intensifiers. A hedge is a linguistic device used to mitigate a statement by lowering epistemic modality and directness with the goal of reducing the threat to face (Salager-Meyer, 1994; Brown and Levinson, 1978.) On the other hand, an intensifier is an adverb or adverbial phrase used to give emphasis (Bolinger, 1972). <nl>The data used in this study is from The Great British Bake Off (which will from here onwards be referred to as GBBO) and MasterChef: The Professionals, which will simply be referred to as MasterChef. These two programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions, but MasterChef features professional chefs and GBBO amateur bakers. There is also a difference in formality as GBBO is more informal and light-hearted which is shown by its two presenters both being comedians. On the other hand, MasterChef is more formal in tone and takes a more serious approach. <nl>This topic has been chosen as it combines politeness theories with gender theory in order to examine how they interact with each other, applying this to a competition environment. Both of the datasets are from television shows therefore it is important to take into account that they may be edited to portray people in a certain way or to best fulfil the main purpose of the shows, which is to entertain. It will be interesting to see how this artificial environment impacts the judges as they may be inclined to be more polite than usual in order to portray themselves well on television, or less polite if their career is based on them playing a \"villain\" role.<nl><nl>Research Background <nl>There has been much debate by linguistics over the relationship between gender and language and the effect the former has on the latter. One of the seminal theorists in this subject is Robin Lakoff (1975) who suggested that there are fundamental differences in how men and women use language. Most relevant to this paper was her identified differences in the use of polite forms, with women typically using more polite forms than men. Janet Holmes (2013) also agreed that women are more likely to use polite forms, although acknowledged that there are differences depending on factors such as the context of the interaction and the specific people involved. She argued that: <nl>\"when all the necessary reservations and qualifications have been taken into account, I think the answer is \u2018yes, women are more polite than men\u2019\" (Holmes, 1995: 5). <nl>It has also been suggested that women use more polite forms as they are more powerless than men (Deuchar, 1988). One theory that supports this is the dominance theory which investigated the number of interruptions between men and women in a mixed gender conversation (Zimmerman and West, 1975). The study found that men are much more likely to interrupt than women and across the eleven conversations they recorded women interrupted only twice whereas men interrupted 46 times. This supports the idea that women are more polite than men, however the study only has a small sample size of 35 participants, all of whom were from a similar background, and is over 45 years old. <nl>Looking more closely at politeness, it can be defined as a type of communication that shows respect and gives some benefit to the other communicators (Leech, 2014). It is an act which aims to maintain the other participants\u2019 positive and negative face (Goffman, 1967). <nl>Leech\u2019s politeness principle (1983) argues that speakers must follow six maxims in order to be considered polite. The theory builds on Grice\u2019s maxims of conversation (1975) but expands these maxim\u2019s and focuses them specifically on appearing polite. These maxims of politeness are; tact, generosity, approbation, modesty and agreement. This study will focus on the maxim of approbation, which involves maximising expressions of praise and approval and lessening the expressions of dispraise. <nl>In a recent study, these maxims were applied to high school students and their interactions with teachers in order to investigate how gender influences politeness (Ningsih et al., 2020). The study used a qualitive approach and gathered data through observations and recordings. They found that both male and female students adhered to the politeness principle more strongly with female teachers than with male teachers. This could suggest that how polite a speaker is depends on the gender of the person they are speaking to more than their own gender identification. Although this study looks only at the speaker and does not take into account the gender of the addressee, this could account for some of the patterns of politeness encountered and therefore is worth taking into consideration. <nl>Looking at this previous research, it could be expected that the female judges in this study will show more behaviours associated with politeness than the male judges, which will be shown through an increase of positive adjectives and a decrease of negative adjectives. It is also expected that the female judges will more often seek to minimise the amount of dispraise given and use hedges to save the hearer\u2019s positive face, whilst using more intensifiers to emphasise praise. It is also anticipated that males will dominate the conversation more, which could be seen as impolite as they allow less room in the conversation for the female judges to speak.<nl><nl>Methodology <nl>The data used in this investigation is from the final episode of the 2020 series of GBBO and the 2020 final of MasterChef. In each episode there are three contestants remaining and so, by using the first challenge they are given in each, there are three sets of comparable data for each show. Each judgement was then transcribed using the key in appendix one. The narration in MasterChef was excluded from the transcripts as it was edited in later and therefore was not part of the conversation being analysed. This analysis only focused on the judge\u2019s communication; however, the contestants and presenter\u2019s speech were included in the transcriptions for context. <nl>These programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions and so the type of praisecriticism given is comparable. However, the difference in tone and level of formality between the programmes allows a deeper investigation into the impact of context on politeness. It will be of interest to see whether the hypothesises are realised and whether the tone and formality of each programme impacts this, and if so to what extent. These programmes were also chosen as they have mixed gender judging panels thus the impact of gender can be observed. <nl>Once the data had been collected, it was analysed using a quantitative approach. The number of lines of speech by each of the judges was counted in each extract and placed into table one. In MasterChef there were three judges, two of which were male. In order to calculate the number of lines of speech for the males, the number for each judge was added together and then divided by two. Although this removes the influence of the individual, which is a disadvantage, it allows the proportion of speech by each gender to be directly compared, which for the purposes of this investigation was deemed more important. <nl>When counting the lines of speech, each line was counted as a whole regardless of the length. However, there is one result which contains a half due to the calculation used to find the average. Speech was also counted as one line if it was transcribed across two due to interruption but the utterance carried on unbroken. <nl>The use of adjectives was also counted and placed into a table (table two) and the context of the utterance was used to determine whether an adjective was used positively as praise, or negatively to criticise. The same method was then applied to the use of hedges and intensifiers, which were then discussed in a qualitative light to determine the effect they had on the overall politeness of each statement.<nl><nl>Findings <nl>i. Amount of speech by male and female judges <nl>The following table summarises the number of lines of speech made by male and female judges in each dataset. As there were two male judges in MasterChef the average number of lines of speech made between them has been used, as mentioned in the methodology. <nl><table><nl>Looking at GBBO first, on average the male judge (Paul) utters more lines of speech than the female judge (Prue). In the judgements of contestants one and three, Paul utters eight lines of speech as opposed to Prue\u2019s six lines, an increase of 28.57%. This is befitting the hypothesis that the male judge will speak more than the female judge, however the data featuring contestant two conflicts with this. In this instance, Prue has one more line of speech than Paul which is a 22.22% difference. Overall, Paul speaks more than Prue in two of the three extracts, and in there is a greater difference between the judges when Paul is the one speaking more. Across all three extracts Paul is shown to utter 16.22% more lines of speech than Prue, conforming to the expected results. <nl>Analysing the MasterChef results, the males (Gregg and Marcus) utter more lines of speech in the judgements of contestants one and two than the female judge (Monica). In the transcript featuring contestant one there is a 40% difference in the number of utterances, and in the next there is a 22.22% difference. This is a greater increase in the amount of speech by males as opposed to females than was seen in GBBO. Yet, when the judgement of contestant three is analysed, the largest difference in speech of all the transcripts is shown with Monica speaking 66.67% more lines than the male judges. This means that overall, there is only a 3.39% difference between the male and female judges, with the female judge having uttered more lines in total. This disagrees with the hypothesis that men would talk more but the difference in utterance of lines is minimal. <nl>To conclude, the data from GBBO is in accordance with the hypothesis made that males will utter more lines of speech than females, but the data from MasterChef contradicts it. There are a few possible explanations for why this might have occurred. One explanation is the difference in tone between the two shows; In MasterChef the setting is more formal and professional whereas GBBO is a more informal setting where the judges interact with the contestants more colloquially. Therefore, GBBO mirrors normal conversations more than MasterChef and the context relates more closely to that of the studies researched for this paper. There is also a difference in the way the programmes are formatted. The judgement in GBBO is more like a conversation in the first challenge, so there are examples of turn-taking within the conversation. In contrast, on MasterChef the judges speak one at a time in longer instances and there are no conversations between them. This could influence the results as it means the participants are not dominating the conversation but rather giving a longer individual monologue. <nl>It is also of note that the extracts transcribed are only a couple of minutes long and therefore there is only a relatively small amount of data. In a longer conversation there is a possibility that the difference between male and female speech could become more defined.<nl><nl>ii. Use of adjectives <nl>When categorising the use of adjectives into positive or negative classifications, the context of the sentence was used to determine what category was most appropriate. They were then collated into the table below. <nl><table><nl>For example, \"wobbly\" was classed as a positive adjective as it was used in the utterance \"I like the wobbly lines\" (Appendix three, lines 20-22). <nl>Analysing the use of adjectives by the GBBO judges, Prue used more positive adjectives with each contestant as well as a greater range of adjectives. Looking at the use of negative adjectives, both judges used a similar number however Paul used one more. Therefore, the GBBO data aligns with the hypothesis that the female judge would use more adjectives that signal praise, and the male more negative adjectives. <nl>When comparing this to the results for the MasterChef data, Monica used an equal number of negative adjectives as Marcus, and one more than Gregg who did not use any. This contradicts the hypothesis and suggests that Monica is more willing to risk threatening the contestants face than Gregg, who only uses compliments. When judging the first contestant, Gregg used seven times as many adjectives to give praise than Monica did, and more than twice as many as Marcus. With the next contestant all three judges used the same number of positive adjectives and with the final contestant Monica used the most; using four times as many as Gregg and twice as many as Marcus. Ranking the judges based on their use of positive minus negative adjectives, Marcus and Monica both ranked the same and Gregg ranked highest meaning he is most concerned with politeness and least willing to flout the maxim of approbation. In summary, the data from MasterChef does not support the hypothesis and contrasts with the GBBO results. <nl><nl>iii. Use of hedges and intensifiers <nl>Within this table a colour-coding system has been using to differentiate between the hedges and intensifiers that have been used in relation to negative statements, and those that have been used positively. Text in green represents the words and phrases that have be used in relation to praise, and red has been used for text that relates to dispraise or criticism. <nl><table><nl>The intensifier \"very very\" was kept as one phrase within the table rather than two instances of the word \"very\" to emphasise how strongly the praise was given. <nl>The results from the analysis on hedging and intensifiers is similar to the patterns seen when investigating the use of adjectives. In the GBBO data, Prue used more positively associated hedges and intensifiers and fewer negative ones than Paul. <nl>Similarly, in the MasterChef data Gregg did not use any negative forms of these linguistic features which correlates with his use of adjectives. Although Marcus used more negative forms of the features than Monica, he also used more positive forms therefore showing they have an equal level of politeness as shown with their use of adjectives. <nl>Overall, this section again confirms that the judges in GBBO conform to the ideas of gender and politeness, whereas the judges in MasterChef do not. This could be down to the individual\u2019s character, as the social constructivist theory suggests that gender is only one part of our identity that influences communication; Personality, status, level of education and ethnicity also all serve to shape our communication (Burr, 2015). It suggests that people make each element of this construction relevant or irrelevant as is necessary. This suggests that Monica and Gregg could be choosing not to make their gender relevant to their role as judge, and each is relying on other factors to influence their use of praise instead. <nl><nl>Discussion <nl>One section that is particularly interesting is where Paul and Prue discussed the issues with Dave\u2019s custard slice in the GGBO. In the extract below, both judges use a mixture of hedges and praise to try and soften their criticism of Dave and minimise their flouting of the maxim of approbation. <nl><data_extract><nl>In cooking the adjective \"strong\" can be both positive or negative. In this extract Prue signals that she is using it positively by her use of the phrase \"I love the coffee\" before describing it as strong, thereby using it to praise Dave. The use of the intensifier \"really\" emphasises the strength of the flavour which adds to this praise. This extract also features the word \"stodgy\" three times. In the first instance, Paul used it to criticise Dave\u2019s custard which is an example of a positive face threatening act. However, Paul lessens the impact of the criticism by using the hedging phrase \"a little bit\" therefore minimising the expression of dispraise as laid out in Leech\u2019s maxim of approbation (1983). Prue then repeats this criticism however she uses the adjective \"stodgy\" twice with an emphasis on the first time. In this instance she is using the first expression of stodgy as a hedge to minimise the impact of the second expression, hereby implying it is not as bad as it could be and is only minorly stodgy. Again, this helps to minimise the impoliteness and helps to save face. \"Pretty\" is also used as a hedge in this extract, which lessens the compliment of it being \"delicious\". The use of the adverb \"still\" serves to further lessen it, so although Prue is paying a compliment, she is still acknowledging that the baking has flaws. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, the hypothesises that female judges would use more language concerned with politeness were realised to a certain extent. The patterns of communication shown by the GBBO judges did match up with what was expected, however the judges in MasterChef conformed to these expectations to a much lesser extent. This could be due to the formality of the show as opposed to the more colloquial nature of The Great British Bake Off, although it could also be due to the individual backgrounds and personalities of each judge. There is also a possibility that the gender of the contestant being judged has an impact on how the judges use politeness. Future research could investigate further by looking at a greater range of programmes and including more data for each. There is also an age difference of 35 years between the two female judges so it could be interesting to investigate deeper into how the changes in society between these years have influenced how women use language in reference to politeness.", "Mm, I think maybe I\u2019d have nicer quality of food.

This study will focus on the politeness strategies used by each gender when critiquing the contestants. To achieve this, it will investigate the number of lines of speech, the use of positive as opposed to negative adjectives and the use of hedges or intensifiers. A hedge is a linguistic device used to mitigate a statement by lowering epistemic modality and directness with the goal of reducing the threat to face (Salager-Meyer, 1994; Brown and Levinson, 1978.) On the other hand, an intensifier is an adverb or adverbial phrase used to give emphasis (Bolinger, 1972). <nl>The data used in this study is from The Great British Bake Off (which will from here onwards be referred to as GBBO) and MasterChef: The Professionals, which will simply be referred to as MasterChef. These two programmes were chosen as they are both cooking competitions, but MasterChef features professional chefs and GBBO amateur bakers. There is also a difference in formality as GBBO is more informal and light-hearted which is shown by its two presenters both being comedians. On the other hand, MasterChef is more formal in tone and takes a more serious approach. <nl>This topic has been chosen as it combines politeness theories with gender theory in order to examine how they interact with each other, applying this to a competition environment. Both of the datasets are from television shows therefore it is important to take into account that they may be edited to portray people in a certain way or to best fulfil the main purpose of the shows, which is to entertain. It will be interesting to see how this artificial environment impacts the judges as they may be inclined to be more polite than usual in order to portray themselves well on television, or less polite if their career is based on them playing a \"villain\" role.<nl><nl>Research Background <nl>There has been much debate by linguistics over the relationship between gender and language and the effect the former has on the latter. One of the seminal theorists in this subject is Robin Lakoff (1975) who suggested that there are fundamental differences in how men and women use language. Most relevant to this paper was her identified differences in the use of polite forms, with women typically using more polite forms than men. Janet Holmes (2013) also agreed that women are more likely to use polite forms, although acknowledged that there are differences depending on factors such as the context of the interaction and the specific people involved. She argued that: <nl>\"when all the necessary reservations and qualifications have been taken into account, I think the answer is \u2018yes, women are more polite than men\u2019\" (Holmes, 1995: 5). <nl>It has also been suggested that women use more polite forms as they are more powerless than men (Deuchar, 1988). One theory that supports this is the dominance theory which investigated the number of interruptions between men and women in a mixed gender conversation (Zimmerman and West, 1975). The study found that men are much more likely to interrupt than women and across the eleven conversations they recorded women interrupted only twice whereas men interrupted 46 times. This supports the idea that women are more polite than men, however the study only has a small sample size of 35 participants, all of whom were from a similar background, and is over 45 years old. <nl>Looking more closely at politeness, it can be defined as a type of communication that shows respect and gives some benefit to the other communicators (Leech, 2014). It is an act which aims to maintain the other participants\u2019 positive and negative face (Goffman, 1967). <nl>Leech\u2019s politeness principle (1983) argues that speakers must follow six maxims in order to be considered polite. The theory builds on Grice\u2019s maxims of conversation (1975) but expands these maxim\u2019s and focuses them specifically on appearing polite. These maxims of politeness are; tact, generosity, approbation, modesty and agreement. This study will focus on the maxim of approbation, which involves maximising expressions of praise and approval and lessening the expressions of dispraise. <nl>In a recent study, these maxims were applied to high school students and their interactions with teachers in order to investigate how gender influences politeness (Ningsih et al., 2020). The study used a qualitive approach and gathered data through observations and recordings. They found that both male and female students adhered to the politeness principle more strongly with female teachers than with male teachers. This could suggest that how polite a speaker is depends on the gender of the person they are speaking to more than their own gender identification. Although this study looks only at the speaker and does not take into account the gender of the addressee, this could account for some of the patterns of politeness encountered and therefore is worth taking into consideration. <nl>Looking at this previous research, it could be expected that the female judges in this study will show more behaviours associated with politeness than the male judges, which will be shown through an increase of positive adjectives and a decrease of negative adjectives. It is also expected that the female judges will more often seek to minimise the amount of dispraise given and use hedges to save the hearer\u2019s positive face, whilst using more intensifiers to emphasise praise. It is also anticipated that males will dominate the conversation more, which could be seen as impolite as they allow less room in the conversation for the female judges to speak.<nl><nl>Methodology <nl>The data used in this investigation is from the final episode of the 2020 series of GBBO and the 2020 final of MasterChef.

Therefore, the GBBO data aligns with the hypothesis that the female judge would use more adjectives that signal praise, and the male more negative adjectives. <nl>When comparing this to the results for the MasterChef data, Monica used an equal number of negative adjectives as Marcus, and one more than Gregg who did not use any. This contradicts the hypothesis and suggests that Monica is more willing to risk threatening the contestants face than Gregg, who only uses compliments. When judging the first contestant, Gregg used seven times as many adjectives to give praise than Monica did, and more than twice as many as Marcus. With the next contestant all three judges used the same number of positive adjectives and with the final contestant Monica used the most; using four times as many as Gregg and twice as many as Marcus. Ranking the judges based on their use of positive minus negative adjectives, Marcus and Monica both ranked the same and Gregg ranked highest meaning he is most concerned with politeness and least willing to flout the maxim of approbation. In summary, the data from MasterChef does not support the hypothesis and contrasts with the GBBO results. <nl><nl>iii. Use of hedges and intensifiers <nl>Within this table a colour-coding system has been using to differentiate between the hedges and intensifiers that have been used in relation to negative statements, and those that have been used positively. Text in green represents the words and phrases that have be used in relation to praise, and red has been used for text that relates to dispraise or criticism. <nl><table><nl>The intensifier \"very very\" was kept as one phrase within the table rather than two instances of the word \"very\" to emphasise how strongly the praise was given. <nl>The results from the analysis on hedging and intensifiers is similar to the patterns seen when investigating the use of adjectives. In the GBBO data, Prue used more positively associated hedges and intensifiers and fewer negative ones than Paul. <nl>Similarly, in the MasterChef data Gregg did not use any negative forms of these linguistic features which correlates with his use of adjectives. Although Marcus used more negative forms of the features than Monica, he also used more positive forms therefore showing they have an equal level of politeness as shown with their use of adjectives. <nl>Overall, this section again confirms that the judges in GBBO conform to the ideas of gender and politeness, whereas the judges in MasterChef do not. This could be down to the individual\u2019s character, as the social constructivist theory suggests that gender is only one part of our identity that influences communication; Personality, status, level of education and ethnicity also all serve to shape our communication (Burr, 2015). It suggests that people make each element of this construction relevant or irrelevant as is necessary. This suggests that Monica and Gregg could be choosing not to make their gender relevant to their role as judge, and each is relying on other factors to influence their use of praise instead. <nl><nl>Discussion <nl>One section that is particularly interesting is where Paul and Prue discussed the issues with Dave\u2019s custard slice in the GGBO. In the extract below, both judges use a mixture of hedges and praise to try and soften their criticism of Dave and minimise their flouting of the maxim of approbation. <nl><data_extract><nl>In cooking the adjective \"strong\" can be both positive or negative. In this extract Prue signals that she is using it positively by her use of the phrase \"I love the coffee\" before describing it as strong, thereby using it to praise Dave. The use of the intensifier \"really\" emphasises the strength of the flavour which adds to this praise. This extract also features the word \"stodgy\" three times. In the first instance, Paul used it to criticise Dave\u2019s custard which is an example of a positive face threatening act. However, Paul lessens the impact of the criticism by using the hedging phrase \"a little bit\" therefore minimising the expression of dispraise as laid out in Leech\u2019s maxim of approbation (1983). Prue then repeats this criticism however she uses the adjective \"stodgy\" twice with an emphasis on the first time. In this instance she is using the first expression of stodgy as a hedge to minimise the impact of the second expression, hereby implying it is not as bad as it could be and is only minorly stodgy. Again, this helps to minimise the impoliteness and helps to save face. \"Pretty\" is also used as a hedge in this extract, which lessens the compliment of it being \"delicious\". The use of the adverb \"still\" serves to further lessen it, so although Prue is paying a compliment, she is still acknowledging that the baking has flaws. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, the hypothesises that female judges would use more language concerned with politeness were realised to a certain extent. The patterns of communication shown by the GBBO judges did match up with what was expected, however the judges in MasterChef conformed to these expectations to a much lesser extent. This could be due to the formality of the show as opposed to the more colloquial nature of The Great British Bake Off, although it could also be due to the individual backgrounds and personalities of each judge. There is also a possibility that the gender of the contestant being judged has an impact on how the judges use politeness. Future research could investigate further by looking at a greater range of programmes and including more data for each. There is also an age difference of 35 years between the two female judges so it could be interesting to investigate deeper into how the changes in society between these years have influenced how women use language in reference to politeness.", "Hi <addr15_FN>,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Just to update you, my new HR manager began at the start of this month and after speaking to her she is happy to meet with you.

{"id": "d04d985f-7b59-44fe-aaa2-dc5c9697fce908007", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Aims and Research Questions<nl>The lockdown amidst COVID-19 has made significant disruptions in academic activities. In this lockdown period, it was reported that learners were mostly suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety (42.0%) (Kapasia, N., Paul, P., Roy, A., Saha, J., Zaveri, A., Mallick, R., ... &amp; Chouhan, P. 2020). The negative impact on student mental and physical well-being due to lockdown restrictions, may be seen as detrimental for their academia and overall performance. Other research has been carried out on the wider population, not students specifically, however the COVID-19 lockdown can be seen to affect others negatively, in terms of mental health. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderatesevere insomnia (Gualano, M. R., Lo Moro, G., Voglino, G., Bert, F., &amp; Siliquini, R. 2020). However, research on the wider student experience during COVID-19 in the UK lacks exposure, so the given indication to the gap, conducting this research could be beneficial to raise greater awareness to the subject.<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as the chosen method<nl>IPA is concerned with lived experience. Experience covers quite a lot of territory (Cooper, H. E., Camic, P. M., Long, D. L., Panter, A. T., Rindskopf, D. E., &amp; Sher, K. J. 2012). Furthermore, IPA focuses on the detailed examination of particulars, first providing an in-depth account of each case before moving to look for patterning\u2019s of convergence and divergence across cases (Eatough, V., &amp; Smith, J. A. 2008).  This method allows the researcher to analyse and understand an individual\u2019s experience towards a certain event \u2013 which in this case would be the global pandemic and how it has affected students: it allows us to explore different aspects that may have been impacted and gives us the chance to begin to comprehend those experiences. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>1. \"Feels like a waste of a university experience\"; a student who has been affected by the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>Missing out on experiences and opportunities as a university student, is a main theme in this account - which includes spending time with friends, enjoying the nightlife, parties and academic events (e.g. lectures and seminars). Natasha draws up on the fact that the university experience she is currently having is very different to what she had prior to the COVID-19 restrictions in her first year. Although, she highlights that she had been able to enjoy some of the perks of being a student in her first year of study, she emphasises the lack of it now and realises that she had taken for granted some of the opportunities she had in first year, as she states - \"I definitely should have taken those erm (.) opportunities and just spend it with the people I like being around\". This may highlight the idea that Natasha feels regret because certain experiences are not as readily available as they were before.<nl>1.1 \"I\u2019m not seeing my friends as often as I would do... I\u2019m not going out\": the negatives highlighted due to the lockdown. <nl>Natasha was asked to compare her first year to her current year of university, and the main focus had been that there is a lack of opportunity to go out with friends - to restaurants, clubs and parties: all of which have been impacted significantly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. Further down in the interview she once again emphasises the fact that she yearns for a greater chance to go out to social events: \"I really do miss going out with them and seeing them and spending time with them\". It may suggest that Natasha, who is already limited by the distance from university to her hometown and who may have relied on interaction from social events at university, has been severely impacted and may go on to feel \"lonely\" within these circumstances, as she had previously mentioned when asked who she was able to communicate with at the moment. <nl><nl>There is no doubt that one of the main disadvantages Natasha focuses on is the idea that her personality is hindered by the lockdown: \"there is a lot of downsides...one of the things I love the most like going out, seeing my friends\", she draws attention to this significant piece missing in her life and emphasises how much she enjoys going out and seeing my friends by using the word \"love\". Due to the restrictions there may be an imbalance of work and leisure, Natasha may feel as though she is trapped in unhappiness during this global pandemic. <nl>1.2 \"...I\u2019ve not met anyone new on my course which is a bit upsetting\": the lack of engagement due to face-to-face teaching being moved online. <nl>When Natasha was asked: \"How they get along with engaging with other students\" - the response steered in a direction where she expressed a disappointment in the lack of opportunity to meet new course mates. She stated this a couple of times whilst answering this question: \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\", which may indicate that she has been deeply affected by the fact that the opportunity to engage with other students has been stripped away.<nl>University can be advertised amongst students as being a place where there is a chance to meet many different people - however, the outlook has changed significantly as those opportunities have been limited due to the restrictions; \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\" - Natasha emphasises that university no longer serves the purpose of networking and meeting new people because of social distancing.<nl><nl>2.0 \"...detached mentally from my studies\": recognising the lack of motivation.<nl>Main theme in this segment is how Natasha highlights the depletion of her mental well-being towards her studies and daily life. The lack of face-to-face teaching seems to be the reason for this, as further down the interview she mentions - \"I don\u2019t feel like a uni student (.) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m mentally there so my motivation has decreased signi-significantly\" which further supports the idea that the restrictions are detrimental to university students - due to the vast amount of lectures being moved online. This mentality and decrease of motivation may indicate a severe impact towards Natasha\u2019s mental health and well-being during this period of time. However, this could also be catastrophic for her university grades, as the lack of motivation may hinder the quality of her work and may lead her to underachieve. <nl><nl>2.1 \"...my mind is always in autopilot\": there is a lack of conscious control. <nl>Natasha goes on to use this phrase to describe her consciousness during the days in lockdown. This may emphasise the idea that her time spent in lockdown is constant and uneventful leading her to lose conscious awareness of what she is doing. The use of the word \"autopilot\" underlines the fact that she is aware that she is mentally detached from her life due to the sudden societal changes from the virus. On the other hand, it can be implied that she is comparing herself to that of a machine - where she is constantly stuck in a pattern doing the same thing daily.<nl>She goes on to mention that her \"days kinda merge into one\"- and further explains that she finds it easy to \"lose track\" of what she is doing and what she \"should be doing\",  which may lead to imply that lockdown has had both mental and physical obstacles, that Natasha has encountered and finds it difficult to plan her days and keep to a schedule. The use of the strong verb \"merge\" accentuates the difficulty Natasha is having to distinguish the days as they go by, possibly creating a blurred sense of reality whilst living with the restrictions.<nl><nl>2.2 \"spend the whole day in bed and its really taking a toll on me mentally\": is showing traits of a mental health disorder due to the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>When Natasha was asked how her daily life had changed, she proceeded to emphasise that the gym after the first lockdown, had allowed her to make progress \"mentally and physically\". However, the gyms were forced to close again following the second national lockdown. This proved to be a significant impact for Natasha \u2013 as further down in the answer she stated that she would \"spend the whole day in bed\". This may suggest that she may have been experiencing a mental health related disorder which could have been onset due to the second lockdown. This may portray the risk that the restrictions have towards the well-being of students. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, Natasha has had a wide range of negative changes and experiences whilst being a university student during the global pandemic\u2013 most aspects do relate to the new introduction of social distancing: which has proven to be a big change for her as she thrives of socialising and meeting new people. Natasha who has moved out from their hometown and is now situated in the city where she attends university is likely to feel lonely due to not being around friends or family. The decline in mental health has been evident \u2013 towards both her studies and daily life in general. Natasha finds it hard to live in the present and feels mentally absent on some days. This may indicate that being a student during the global pandemic is detrimental for individuals such as Natasha; leading to unhappiness, loneliness, disappointment, decline in mental health and being unmotivated.

It is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued left than when cued right. Data from 38 participants was used. Within-subjects design. Independent variable had two levels: cue left, cue right. Dependant variable was the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V). EEG electrodes were attached to relevant areas using the 1020 system. The results showed that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions. The results are consistent with the hypothesis and previous research.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>The alpha inhibition hypothesis refers to the concept that high alpha is indicative of inhibition and disengagement of task irrelevant brain areas (Klimesch et al., 2007). Alpha wave in the relaxation state has higher power spectrum than in the attention state. Yaomanee, K., Pan-ngum, S., &amp; Ayuthaya, P. I. N. (2012). Concluding that alpha activity can be modulated by attention, thus meaning that alpha activity is reduced when we pay attention to stimuli.<nl>This experiment is a partial replication of Sauseng et al., (2005). Overall, 22 participants used, and they were given a cued visual attention task. Cued with a fixation cross for 34ms, then an arrow cue would indicate which hemifield a target would appear in. There was a 50% chance of being cued left or right, 75% of the trials were valid and 25% of trials were invalid. Results indicated that parietal regions showed stronger alpha lower band frequency suppression contralateral to the attended hemifield. Similar results for upper frequencies. Therefore, the alpha inhibition hypothesis is supported by these findings as there is stronger alpha activity in the task irrelevant brain areas. <nl>To further support these findings, Mazahari et al., (2014) used 57 adolescent participants: 23 normally developing, 17 who have combined subtype ADHD (inattention and hyperactivity) and 17 who have predominantly inattentive ADHD. Used a cued flanker task. Response preparation cue predicted 84% accuracy, or a null cue was shown which had no information about correct response. Overall participants showed alpha suppression following response preparation cues, greater for normally developing participants and least for inattentive ADHD subtypes. The indicative alpha suppression supports the idea that alpha activity can be modulated by attention \u2013 thus being reduced when participants attended to the stimuli.<nl>Following on previous studies, it is predicted that there would be higher alpha amplitudes when cued to expect a stimulus on the left than when cued to expect a stimulus on the right, when recording from the left parietal lobe (P3).  <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>To begin with, 39 undergraduate participants were obtained by volunteer sample, however, one participant was removed as they were only available for one of the two conditions: 38 participants overall. <nl>Design <nl>Within subject\u2019s design, with an independent variable of cue direction with two levels: either left or right. The dependent variable is the alpha amplitude measured in microvolts (\ud835\udf07V).<nl><nl>Materials <nl>A Biopac MP36 was used to record alpha range activity and receive event markers for cue left and cue right conditions. EEG electrodes which were attached to the head. AC Cream and Everi cream was used, in preparation prior to the attachment of electrodes. The software PsychoPy was used to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device. Stimuli were used to present to the visual fields such as: arrow cues left (&lt;) and right (&gt;), large bar (Figure A) and small bar (Figure B) stimuli. <nl><figure><nl> <nl>Procedure <nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG 0.5-35Hz. Digital channels were set up to receive the event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker. A calculation channel was also set up to record the activity in the alpha frequency range of (8 - 13 Hz). The sampling rate was 1000 Hz. <nl>Before preparing the participants, they gave informed consent and were briefed on their right to withdraw from the experiment. To prepare the participants for electrode placement, Everi cream was used to abrase the areas P3, Fz and forehead, selected using the 1020 system (Trans-Cranial Techologies, 2012). The AC cream was then applied on the electrodes: an active electrode was attached to P3. Reference electrodes are attached at Fz. Earth electrodes were attached to the forehead, near the hairline. The impedance levels were checked to be below 10Kohms.  <nl>Participants were given instructions and a practice trial first and were cued with an arrow for 35ms to let participants know which side to expect a stimulus, with an inter-stimulus interval (ISI) set to 600ms-800ms in the practice trial. Different event markers were sent at stimulus onset for the cue left and cue right conditions. Stimuli consisted of either large or small white bars shown either left or right on the screen on a black background for 50ms. The participants respond with either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. They underwent 12 practice trials including feedback about their response, before undergoing 4 blocks of 20 trials. After the practice trail was complete, the participants were given feedback on their performance.<nl>The participants were shortly warned that the real experiment was about to start. The random ISI was set to 200ms-1200ms<nl><nl>Results<nl>Data Treatment<nl>To covert the raw 9-13 Hz Alpha EEG to averaged data. Event markers from PsychoPy were sent to identify when stimuli were presented. Then looked at the period 200ms before stimulus presentation after arrow cues had been shown. The data was rectified, which turns the negative values into positive, in order to show alpha activity regardless of it being excitatory or inhibitory. Averaged over 50 samples to reduce the impact of the outlying or extreme values. The rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA) were then suitable for statistical analysis. <nl>Descriptive and Inferential Statistics<nl>Firstly, to determine whether the data is parametric, a Shapiro-Wilk test was used and p&lt;.005. The p value is less than .05, therefore, a non-parametric equivalent had to be used: <nl>Wilcoxon signed ranks test. <nl><table><nl>Table 1 shows that median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left than cue right conditions and a Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed this difference was significant (T = 566, n = 38, p = .005).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results were consistent with the predicted hypothesis, as the median alpha amplitudes were higher in the cue left, than cue right and this supports the idea that alpha activity at P3 is different depending on which side participants are cued to expect a stimulus. <nl>The results also support previous research and the alpha inhibition hypothesis, as high alpha shows the inhibition of task irrelevant areas due to more activity in the left hemisphere (Klimesch et al., 2007), on the ipsilateral side of where the cue was presented. <nl>Although the results are consistent with the hypothesis, confounding variables may have altered the data to an extent. The participants moving around, may have altered the validity as gross motor movements may contaminate the EEG recordings, (Bell, M. A., &amp; Cuevas, K., 2012).<nl>Overall, there may be some areas for improvement to prevent confounding variables from affecting the data. To prevent motor movements, the participants should be given strict instructions to follow due to the sensitivity of the EEG. The researchers should monitor the participants to check if those instructions are being followed. However, despite these issues, the results can be granted as valid as the correct procedures were taken during the experiment, such as ensuring the impedance levels were below 10Kohms and in addition the results were expected due to previous research.", "Erm, so, in the first picture, I can see two young ladies, erm, er, one in stripy black and white top with blonde hair.

Unipolar depression is a psychological disorder that continues for a long time that causes a lot of distress to the individual. On the other hand, Generalised anxiety disorder (GAD) is the most common anxiety disorder. The anxiety is not related to any specific stimulus but it's all-pervasive. The individual may have persistent and excessive worry about a number of different things, the individual may worry about family, wealth, health, or work. Similar to unipolar depression, GAD continues for a long period of time. Furthermore, both GAD and unipolar depression are similar to the individual\u2019s everyday life is affected. The individual may find it very hard to sleep or they may lose interest in activities they once liked. <nl><nl>One of the cognitive theories of GAD is that according to cognitive theorists such as Beck argue that GAD is associated with dysfunctional beliefs that may be held in schema about the self, the world, and the future. These schema bias the processing of any new information and therefore it's unclear whether this represents a cause or a consequence of GAD. Similarly, depressed individuals tend to develop negative views of themselves, the world, and the future ((Beck, 1987; Gable &amp; Shean, 2000). This creates pessimistic thinking where depressed individuals will believe nothing will be improved in their life. Those individuals will have a sense of worthlessness, guilty, and may end up having suicidal thoughts. <nl><nl>Nevertheless, Individuals who have GAD may get anxiety just thinking about getting through the day, they do not know how to stop this worry and in most cases their anxiety is more intense than the situation. However, unipolar depressed individuals have low energy levels and feel helpless. Both GAD and unipolar depressed individuals might not be able to focus or sleep easily at night. <nl><nl>Cognitive theorists suggest unipolar depression is a result of distorted thoughts and judgements. These can be learned when a child in a dysfunctional family watches their own parents fail to cope with traumatic events. Also, those who have depression may think differently to those who don't as depressed individuals view everything around them in a negative way. Both depression and GAD are similar, these negative thoughts and judgments make it easy for people to develop those disorders. Individuals who have GAD may tend to exaggerate most situations that they face even though those situations might be only mildly threatening to others. GAD is not only related to the external stimuli but also concerned with thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations that are experienced by individuals. This is also <nl><nl>similar to unipolar depression. Furthermore, individuals with GAD assess their worrying in a threatening way as excessive worrying may be a threat to their psychological and physical health (Wells &amp; Carter 2001)."]}

Most likely, participants would have a slower reaction time to incongruent words than congruent because the Stroop test creates a conflict between an incongruent color and word. There have been many studies on the Stroop effect which have been mentioned below, there are supporting research as well as opposing studies. An experiment was carried out on 59 participants and the results supported Stroop (1935), it was found that there was a delay in participants' reaction time when they were presented with incongruent words. There were also many factors which may have affected the results, some of the factors are the use of volunteer sampling and there were also extraneous variables such as time of day. <nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Stroop effect is where there is a delay in reaction time of a task due to the mismatch in a stimuli. Stroop effect was first introduced by John Ridley Stroop, where he conducted an experiment. Participants had to look at the colour of words e.g. blue, red and green, they had to name the colour of the ink the words were written in instead of what was written. Stroop (1935) found that naming font colour when the colour word is incongruent (where the ink color and word was different e.g. Red) is slower than if the colour word and font colour\u2019s congruent (where the ink color and the word refer to the same color e.g. Red).<nl>Furthermore, additional study comes from Cattell (1886) who suggested word reading is automatic due to extensive practice. Moors et al ( 2006) argued that automatic processes are uncontrolled and fast, therefore people cannot follow an instruction not to read as reading cannot be \"turned off\".The hypothesis for the stroop test is that participants\u2019 reaction time (measured in milliseconds) will be slower when they identify incongruent font colours than the congruent font colours. <nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants: 59 undergraduate university participants took part in the experiment.<nl>Design: The design was repeated measures and within subjects, the students volunteered to participate. The dependent variable was state with two levels; congruent and incongruent words. The independent variable was the reaction time measured in milliseconds.<nl>Materials: PsychoPy was used to design and collect reaction time data. The left key represented red, right key represented blue and up key represented green. <nl>Procedure: Firstly, the participants had to give consent in order to participate in the experiment, after they were told that they would be presented with a list of words on a computer or laptop. They had to press the correct keys for the name of the colour the words were written in and not for what was written. For example, if Green came up on the screen, they should select the left key which represents red. There were 6 types of stimuli in 10 blocks for 60 trials. <nl><nl>Results<nl><table><nl>Table 1. Shows that mean reaction times were longer in the colour incongruent (CI) than the colour congruent (CC) condition. (M= 966.8, SD= 405.1). A Wilcoxon signed ranks test showed that this difference was highly statistically significant ( T= 403, n= 59, p= &lt; .001). Data shows that participants took longer to correctly identify the font colours when they were incongruent with the colour of the words written. <nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>The results that were found were consistent with previous research of Stroop (1935) and supported the hypothesis as participants did have a slower reaction time when identifying incongruent font colours and had a faster reaction time for the congruent condition. The reaction time was faster for the congruent condition because Cattell (1886) argued that wording reading is automatic therefore it\u2019s quicker for individuals to read the word represented to them in that condition. However, different research finding has been reported from a similar stroop task called emotional stroop (Williams et al. 1996). It was found that the emotional Stroop involves only emotional and neutral words and that color does not affect reaction time because it does not conflict with word meaning. The classic stroop test shows that the reaction time is slower because there is a conflict between an incongruent color and the word. Furthermore,  Salthouse and Meinz (1995) argue that even though age differences specific to stroop interference were minimal, other research may show the relationship between age and Stroop interference was still significant (West &amp; Baylis, 1998). <nl><nl>Finally, some of the methodological issues regarding the experiment were that volunteer sampling was used, only university students participated. Findings cannot be generalised to those who did not volunteer and the finding may not be representative of the whole population. An improvement could be made by selecting people of all ages not just university students. Another issue was that the experiment was not completed in a controlled environment, this means they could have had help from others. Another improvement could be that all the participants complete the test in a psychology lab. Also there may have been extraneous variables which may have affected the results, e.g. some participants may have completed at 9am, they would most likely been tired and have had a slower reaction time. This can be improved by making sure all students complete the test at the same time."]}
{"id": "2c5ede8d-3fd7-453f-806f-97c0126658d5", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Aims and Research Questions<nl>The lockdown amidst COVID-19 has made significant disruptions in academic activities. In this lockdown period, it was reported that learners were mostly suffering from stress, depression, and anxiety (42.0%) (Kapasia, N., Paul, P., Roy, A., Saha, J., Zaveri, A., Mallick, R., ... &amp; Chouhan, P. 2020). The negative impact on student mental and physical well-being due to lockdown restrictions, may be seen as detrimental for their academia and overall performance. Other research has been carried out on the wider population, not students specifically, however the COVID-19 lockdown can be seen to affect others negatively, in terms of mental health. Depression and anxiety symptom prevalence was 24.7% and 23.2%; 42.2% had sleep disturbances and, among them, 17.4% reported moderatesevere insomnia (Gualano, M. R., Lo Moro, G., Voglino, G., Bert, F., &amp; Siliquini, R. 2020). However, research on the wider student experience during COVID-19 in the UK lacks exposure, so the given indication to the gap, conducting this research could be beneficial to raise greater awareness to the subject.<nl>Interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) as the chosen method<nl>IPA is concerned with lived experience. Experience covers quite a lot of territory (Cooper, H. E., Camic, P. M., Long, D. L., Panter, A. T., Rindskopf, D. E., &amp; Sher, K. J. 2012). Furthermore, IPA focuses on the detailed examination of particulars, first providing an in-depth account of each case before moving to look for patterning\u2019s of convergence and divergence across cases (Eatough, V., &amp; Smith, J. A. 2008).  This method allows the researcher to analyse and understand an individual\u2019s experience towards a certain event \u2013 which in this case would be the global pandemic and how it has affected students: it allows us to explore different aspects that may have been impacted and gives us the chance to begin to comprehend those experiences. <nl><nl>Analysis<nl>1. \"Feels like a waste of a university experience\"; a student who has been affected by the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>Missing out on experiences and opportunities as a university student, is a main theme in this account - which includes spending time with friends, enjoying the nightlife, parties and academic events (e.g. lectures and seminars). Natasha draws up on the fact that the university experience she is currently having is very different to what she had prior to the COVID-19 restrictions in her first year. Although, she highlights that she had been able to enjoy some of the perks of being a student in her first year of study, she emphasises the lack of it now and realises that she had taken for granted some of the opportunities she had in first year, as she states - \"I definitely should have taken those erm (.) opportunities and just spend it with the people I like being around\". This may highlight the idea that Natasha feels regret because certain experiences are not as readily available as they were before.<nl>1.1 \"I\u2019m not seeing my friends as often as I would do... I\u2019m not going out\": the negatives highlighted due to the lockdown. <nl>Natasha was asked to compare her first year to her current year of university, and the main focus had been that there is a lack of opportunity to go out with friends - to restaurants, clubs and parties: all of which have been impacted significantly due to the COVID-19 restrictions and social distancing. Further down in the interview she once again emphasises the fact that she yearns for a greater chance to go out to social events: \"I really do miss going out with them and seeing them and spending time with them\". It may suggest that Natasha, who is already limited by the distance from university to her hometown and who may have relied on interaction from social events at university, has been severely impacted and may go on to feel \"lonely\" within these circumstances, as she had previously mentioned when asked who she was able to communicate with at the moment. <nl><nl>There is no doubt that one of the main disadvantages Natasha focuses on is the idea that her personality is hindered by the lockdown: \"there is a lot of downsides...one of the things I love the most like going out, seeing my friends\", she draws attention to this significant piece missing in her life and emphasises how much she enjoys going out and seeing my friends by using the word \"love\". Due to the restrictions there may be an imbalance of work and leisure, Natasha may feel as though she is trapped in unhappiness during this global pandemic. <nl>1.2 \"...I\u2019ve not met anyone new on my course which is a bit upsetting\": the lack of engagement due to face-to-face teaching being moved online. <nl>When Natasha was asked: \"How they get along with engaging with other students\" - the response steered in a direction where she expressed a disappointment in the lack of opportunity to meet new course mates. She stated this a couple of times whilst answering this question: \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\", which may indicate that she has been deeply affected by the fact that the opportunity to engage with other students has been stripped away.<nl>University can be advertised amongst students as being a place where there is a chance to meet many different people - however, the outlook has changed significantly as those opportunities have been limited due to the restrictions; \"it would be quite nice to know other people on my course but now I don\u2019t really have the option to\" - Natasha emphasises that university no longer serves the purpose of networking and meeting new people because of social distancing.<nl><nl>2.0 \"...detached mentally from my studies\": recognising the lack of motivation.<nl>Main theme in this segment is how Natasha highlights the depletion of her mental well-being towards her studies and daily life. The lack of face-to-face teaching seems to be the reason for this, as further down the interview she mentions - \"I don\u2019t feel like a uni student (.) I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m mentally there so my motivation has decreased signi-significantly\" which further supports the idea that the restrictions are detrimental to university students - due to the vast amount of lectures being moved online. This mentality and decrease of motivation may indicate a severe impact towards Natasha\u2019s mental health and well-being during this period of time. However, this could also be catastrophic for her university grades, as the lack of motivation may hinder the quality of her work and may lead her to underachieve. <nl><nl>2.1 \"...my mind is always in autopilot\": there is a lack of conscious control. <nl>Natasha goes on to use this phrase to describe her consciousness during the days in lockdown. This may emphasise the idea that her time spent in lockdown is constant and uneventful leading her to lose conscious awareness of what she is doing. The use of the word \"autopilot\" underlines the fact that she is aware that she is mentally detached from her life due to the sudden societal changes from the virus. On the other hand, it can be implied that she is comparing herself to that of a machine - where she is constantly stuck in a pattern doing the same thing daily.<nl>She goes on to mention that her \"days kinda merge into one\"- and further explains that she finds it easy to \"lose track\" of what she is doing and what she \"should be doing\",  which may lead to imply that lockdown has had both mental and physical obstacles, that Natasha has encountered and finds it difficult to plan her days and keep to a schedule. The use of the strong verb \"merge\" accentuates the difficulty Natasha is having to distinguish the days as they go by, possibly creating a blurred sense of reality whilst living with the restrictions.<nl><nl>2.2 \"spend the whole day in bed and its really taking a toll on me mentally\": is showing traits of a mental health disorder due to the coronavirus restrictions.<nl>When Natasha was asked how her daily life had changed, she proceeded to emphasise that the gym after the first lockdown, had allowed her to make progress \"mentally and physically\". However, the gyms were forced to close again following the second national lockdown. This proved to be a significant impact for Natasha \u2013 as further down in the answer she stated that she would \"spend the whole day in bed\". This may suggest that she may have been experiencing a mental health related disorder which could have been onset due to the second lockdown. This may portray the risk that the restrictions have towards the well-being of students. <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, Natasha has had a wide range of negative changes and experiences whilst being a university student during the global pandemic\u2013 most aspects do relate to the new introduction of social distancing: which has proven to be a big change for her as she thrives of socialising and meeting new people. Natasha who has moved out from their hometown and is now situated in the city where she attends university is likely to feel lonely due to not being around friends or family. The decline in mental health has been evident \u2013 towards both her studies and daily life in general. Natasha finds it hard to live in the present and feels mentally absent on some days. This may indicate that being a student during the global pandemic is detrimental for individuals such as Natasha; leading to unhappiness, loneliness, disappointment, decline in mental health and being unmotivated.

These are experiences and sensations which are not comprehensible to others, but to the person experiencing them. Hallucinations include patients hearing, seeing, tasting, touching, and smelling things. An example of hallucinations is the patient may hear voices that may seem angry or urgent and often make demands on them which results in the patient getting injured.<nl><nl>Another positive symptom is delusions, these are beliefs which may conflict with reality. A schizophrenic patient will hold onto those beliefs even though they may be evidence that disproves those false beliefs. An example is paranoid delusions, they may believe people are out to hurt them or the thought people are doing things when there is no evidence that these things are taking place. <nl><nl>Lastly, a positive symptom of schizophrenia is thought disorder. This is a disorganised way of thinking which leads to abnormal ways of expressing language when speaking or writing. An example of a thought disorder is thought blocking. This the patient interrupts themselves inappropriately mid-sentence and changes the topic of conversation. They may pause for several seconds or minutes."]}
