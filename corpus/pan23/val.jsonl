Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}

These characteristics can be highlighted as territory (an area with defined borders), external and internal sovereignty where a state must be able to defend its territory and not be too dependent on another power. A state achieves sovereignty when it is recognised by the family of states as the \u2018sole governing authority within its territory and as the legal equal of other states\u2019 (The Modern State, 2020). Furthermore, there has to be legitimacy in which there is recognised rule, examples of this are traditional legitimacy, charismatic legitimacy and rational-legal legitimacy; the legitimacy enhances a state\u2019s sovereignty at a lower cost. The last characteristic is modern bureaucracy, this is required to generate as well as collect revenue. In this essay we will be discussing and critically examining Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, who criticizes the moralistic view of authority. Machiavelli although seen as an evil man, had a large influence on the future of modern civilisation especially in comparison to the artists of his time. <nl><nl>For Machiavelli, moral basis on which to judge the difference between illegitimate and legitimate uses of power does not exist, arguing that this does not add to the actual possession of power \u2013 rather the legitimacy rests upon the threat of coercive force. His beliefs rest in those that the leaders should avoid the common values of justice and mercy in preference to the use of violence and fear, particularly if it is in the best interest such as through gaining and expanding political power. Historians have stated Machiavelli to be the \u2018teacher of evil\u2019 such as Leo Strauss (McShea, 1963). However, Machiavelli has been credited with formulating the \"modern concept of the state\", that is understood in the Weberian sense of a \u2018form of rule possessing a monopoly of coercive authority within a set territorial boundary\u2019 (Nederman, 2019). Machiavelli derived his views from the experience of the Caesura Borgia.  However, Machiavelli did contribute to the way we understand the modern state now as he proposed his own conception of the \"civil principality\" whilst subverting his previous medieval idea of state as regime (Sellers,2015). However, it should be noted that force is not the only weapon to rule the people so his argument can be seen as psychologically weak.<nl><nl>Machiavelli also states that principality can be seen to be governed by a single ruler and is helped by anointed ministers which is the case in many current states seen today. Machiavelli states that the idea of taking over depends on the character of region than the character of the prince, he has the strong belief that the citizens will recollect and fight for their liberty. Although we have grown out of medieval brutality, it can be argued that the modern-day equivalent of killing is to send rivals to jail or allow opponents to lose if there is indecisiveness. An example of this is Brexit, where the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was seen as indecisive and therefore could not gain enough votes in time for the referendum. Another way Machiavelli is modernised is through the idea that leaders will need to make severe decisions, such as through firing a member of the cabinet. An example of this is the Night of Long Knives in 1962 where Macmillan sacked a third of his cabinet. Nevertheless, Machiavelli ignored individualism and had one sided views of human nature which can be viewed as a critical flaw.<nl><nl>For Machiavelli, law is also impossible to follow without the required military as arms are a requirement in order for leaders to establish great frameworks. Although it can be criticised as we do not follow medieval combat, there are still some aspects which apply to the modern state, for instance the concept that an army from your own principality is most beneficial for defending yourself \u2013 and this concept is universally accepted. Machiavelli also made the point that there is conflict of interest which can be seen in the modern state also, for example through the leak of the Panama papers. What is also seen in the modern state is Machiavelli\u2019s view on auxiliary troops being faithful to someone else, for example through the rise of the Taliban, as although it was intended for the Taliban to fight the Soviet Union, they later turned and became the lead terrorist group. In Antonio Negri\u2019s view, Machiavelli belongs to a \u2018political alternative of modern thought grounded on a revolutionary version of constituent power\u2019 (Negri and Maurizia Boscagli, 2009). However, Quentin Skinner and J.G.A Pocock write that we should regard Machiavelli as part of the republican tradition, i.e. as part of the living legacy of Aristotelian philosophy (Roecklein, 2012). Nonetheless, Machiavelli was the first modern thinker to have thought of the State as an independent entity and not recognising any religious organisation exterior to it and The Prince has been a choice of several political leaders such as Louis XIV, Napoleon Bonaparte and Benito Mussolini. <nl><nl>The modern state was \u2018constituted by an abstraction from personal to impersonal rule\u2019 (Mansfield, 1983). With Machiavelli we encounter a challenge to the classical regime which is expressed in his use of stato (his stato is someone\u2019s to acquire), whereas for Aristotle\u2019s regime there is some ordering of the inhabitants of the city. The central theme of Machiavelli\u2019s political ideas is power with absolute state being the end. The state is viewed as superior to all associations and is sovereign as well as autonomous however he also stated that religion cannot influence politics and the church cannot control the state, which is not the case. <nl><nl>Comparing Machiavelli to other theorists allows for us to critically evaluate him further. Plato had the vision of every human being born into a division which was maintained and creating an arrangement for the state in the course of classism whereas Machiavelli proposed with the aim of sovereignty to support the nation in which the leader controls and protects its citizens. Machiavelli\u2019s concept of virt\u00fa highlights the utilitarian needs of the country. For Machiavelli virt\u00fa outweighs virtue in times of need whilst Plato believes a \u2018just ruler must behave the same at all times\u2019 however we have to consider they were writing in different eras, as Plato\u2019s philosophy is based on utopian principles and Machiavelli is viewed as a realist (Abrams, M, 2017). Aristotle divides government into two categories: good and bad with good forms fall aristocracy and under bad fall oligarchy. Aristotle wanted to help society achieve goodness through politics whereas on the other hand Machiavelli sought to achieve the maintenance of power and stability. They have differing views in terms of Aristotle claimed that if an entire state is made to fear their ruler, this would cause unhappiness however Machiavelli suggested that it is better to be feared than loved as it creates balance. However, they are on similar sides when it comes to liberation, as in the Prince it stated such ruler should not dictate the actions of others, but all together Machiavelli was seeking a practical type of politics whilst Aristotle took a rather idealistic approach (Tabone, 2020).  <nl><nl>Hobbes and Machiavelli have fascinating ideas on human nature impacting the state as the common theme is the usage of fear, meaning power needs to be acquired and maintained but we have to remember that Machiavelli\u2019s time period involved the peak of absolutism and hierarchies. Philosophers such a John Locke have directly opposing views on government. Locke\u2019s perception of revolt as a right gave people excessive power compared to the government, this did not exist during the time of Machiavelli. Locke believed in the idea of the government working for the people, however this is directly opposed to Machiavelli\u2019s thought that the ruler should do what it takes to remain in power (Chris Joseph, 2014). Machiavelli recommended that coercion should be used in order to govern whereas Locke favoured a social contract with the concept of dual accountability. Although Machiavelli\u2019s concept of coercion is flawed, he did recognise that rulers could not govern by this alone and advocated for the use of cunning and subterfuge, Locke\u2019s social contract did not contain an element of this. Machiavelli had a pessimistic view of individuals and believed human beings are fundamentally bad whereas Locke was more optimistic. In the modern state it follows Machiavelli\u2019s model more as the rulers in the modern state are comprised of the rich and powerful in society. Mill and Machiavelli also have the same solution to government in freedom of speech, they are both aware that people cannot have a hand in ruling itself. <nl><nl>Political leaders and their followers believed that Machiavellism was a disease infesting the politic body. He is still regarded with a negative reputation, but he still aids us to understand the modern state. Machiavelli promoted the central role of a citizen in preserving institutions which is reflected through the meaning of the Second Amendment in the U.S. Constitution (Bernard, 2009). Among modern believers of Machiavelli, there are Burmese generals such as Web Jiabao, the Former Premier of China and Lord Mandelson (Bernard, 2009). Machiavelli and Pareto agree in terms of this where they say egotism or selfishness as a natural property of the human species (Femia, 2013). According to Machiavellism though, the principle aim of prince is the unification as well as welfare of the state which showed reality of practical politics. He deduced that the internal unity and powerful government were the essential of any state by observing the affairs of the interstate rivalries. The sole aim of the prince is also to increase power in ways such as to be an expert in managing and organising a war- power is seen as the only reason of the state. <nl><nl>To conclude Machiavelli contributes to the \u2018comprehension of constituent power as a living force within social order\u2019 (Lucchese, 2016). He developed a revolutionary position, suggesting that political conflict is not a destabilising factor, but rather the grounding force of free republics. His concepts and ideas are often misunderstood as he displayed rare intellect to become a partisan in an age where absolute monarchy held control (Mathur, 1991). All together Machiavelli was the first thinker who justified secular state and the first advocate for autonomy for the state. He unfairly became associated with evil through his critical work written about The Prince, and although it did not get translated until almost a hundred years later the negative view about Machiavelli had already been established into Elizabethan England. All together he communicated priority to the state and put it above morality and religion as it is the highest form of social organisation and most essential to promote human welfare, and this is seen clearly in the modern state. Machiavelli\u2019s Prince dealt exclusively with the interests of a single person of power that focuses on only the leader\u2019s welfare in mind whereas the theories of Plato, Aristotle, Locke and Mill dealt with the welfare of society. However, in the modern state there Machiavelli did consider that the Prince needed to maintain good relations with the people which is what we observe. It can be agreed the way that Machiavelli talks about the state as Machiavelli was a realist.", "I have attached my CV<nl>My contact number is <phone_number><nl>Thank you and have a pleasant day<new>I was just wondering as someone who has wanted to go to <unviersity> for a while, would having 3 A*s, 6 A's and a B at GCSE put me at a large disadvantage with other competitors?

One is sat down wearing a denim jacket, and she has twists in her hair. The other woman is wearing a black and white stripey top, dark blue jeans and a belt. So number one consists of the lady in the denim jacket sitting down, she\u2019s staring at something and her mouth is wide open. She has quite a surprised, but in a positive way, erm, her facial feature shows that she is looking at something which is surprising. And the other lady, on the right of her, is looking downwards towards something. Erm, also the lady with the black and white stripey top has medium length hair, is quite fair skinned, has dark brown hair going into more of an ombr\u00e9 blonde. Whereas the other lady sat down is, she is a Black lady, with black twists. Also, by the picture, it looks like the lady in the black and white top is showing er, her friend next to her, they look like they know each other. And yeah, they look like they\u2019re friends. They look like they are s- in some sort of maybe school environment. It\u2019s a casual environment, which is seen by the clothes that they are wearing. Another way this picture can also be seen is the lady in the denim jacket is looking, n-not looking at something that the girl in the black and white top is showing her, she\u2019s actually looking at something else, and that she\u2019s surprised by what she\u2019s seen because her mouth is wide open. In the second picture, it looks like erm, there are two boys in this picture. One is of South Asian descent, has short black hair and is wearing a black and red chequered shirt with a white top underneath, and there\u2019s a boy next to him on the, his left. And he\u2019s quite fair skinned, has a black ear piercing, and has short brown hair. He\u2019s wearing a top which consists of black and white flowers with red writing on top, but you can\u2019t read the writing. And the guy in the black and red sweatshirt is staring at a MacBook Air, and, er, looks really interested in what he is reading. Whereas his friend next to him is either staring at him, or there is something that\u2019s distracted him that\u2019s next to the guy in the black and red sweatshirt. From the looks of it, because of how close they are, they look like friends. And they look like university students, or a little bit older. They, yeah, they look around the age of between eighteen to er twenty-two. Yeah. In the background actually there are light green and dark green spots, with a black background, which looks like either a wallpaper or it looks like they\u2019re sitting down on a sofa which has that background. And the table that the MacBook is on is a wooden table with different shades of brown, giving it that timber sort of effect. Yeah. In the third picture, there is a Black female and on her left is a South Asian male. South Asian male has a beard and almost a buzz cut which has grown out. And he is wearing a dark green shirt with a long black coat that has buttons on the side, and also a long collar with beige trousers, dark beige trousers, and he is wearing black trainers. In the background of these two people there is a sort of spiral, almost hypnotising effect, sort of wallpaper. Which is, consists of many small, round, white circles across a black backdrop. The girl is wearing a black top with a black leather jacket, and is holding something in her hand, which I can\u2019t see it. Oh, she\u2019s holding something and it looks like there is also a hand in the picture, next to both of her hands. She\u2019s also wearing dark maroon leggings, with light brown leather boots. There is a table in front of them which has something on the glass table, which consists of either leaflets or pamphlets. And yeah, the male is also holding a book which he\u2019s gone through about, I\u2019d say, fifty per cent of. He looks like he\u2019s in the middle of the book; he looks like he\u2019s about to turn a page. They both are staring at the same thing, it looks like, because their eyes are in the same direction. They are both smiling. Erm, you can tell they\u2019re both quite comfortable with each other because of how close they are sat to each other. It looks like they are almost friends. It also looks like they may be students as well, because that looks like quite a big book. So yeah, number three has, you can tell they\u2019re both looking at something which makes them happy, or is something that is amusing to them. Because neither of them look confused. I-I think they both look eager to know more.", "It would have to be good Thai food. Thai food or, I would say Thai food, Chinese or American soul. It literally depends on my mood. So, Thai food, red Thai curry, the spicier the better, whereas you can also have prawn toast. I think prawn toast is more of a Chinese sort of thing but that, I love Chinese cuisine as well, Singapore fried rice. And then you have American soul food. So, that\u2019s like the hefty like burgers where it\u2019s just, it looks dirty like you have the chicken, bacon, everything  <unintelligible>  and the mash and peas and then the milkshakes and the fries. So, oh, it makes me hungry now  <laugh> . But yeah, erm, that would, those\u2019d probably be my favourite cuisines but. Because I can\u2019t make it at home, I can only eat it out. So yeah, it\u2019s more finding the best places that do those cuisines and then experimenting. But yeah, those are my favourite, I would think.<new>My favourite dish to cook would probably be  <unintelligible> , let\u2019s say than vegetarian than vegie lasagne. So, instead of the minced meat, in my family we use aubergine, courgettes, peppers. Mm, er, I make a  <unintelligible>  I make one in cheese sauce and like the tomato sauce and then we have like pasta sheets. So yeah, that would be my favourite meal to, probably, cook, that with garlic bread. But, obviously, if I\u2019m at uni, I\u2019d be doing, because I don\u2019t eat beef either, I would mix that up with, erm, turkey mince, which is a really, or lamb mince, which is a really good alternative. Apart from that, I would probably also say tacos. Tacos are my favourite to make but instead of, obviously, using beef, like I only, erm, would use black beans. So like, erm, that\u2019s really nice. And then we make our own guacamole and it\u2019s like with, ah, I love that too. Yeah, those are like my two favourite things to make.<new>Okay, yeah, sure. So, with the lasagne, I\u2019d say the lasagne\u2019s definitely the more complicated one, we start off by so, you obviously chop your aubergines, courgettes, peppers, chop them all, may, preferably into slices. And then we roast but whilst we roast, we add like our oil. So, I use chilli oil just because I like mine spicy. And yeah, so we roast. We have like a sort of grill thing so we let it roast for quite some time till all the vegetables like shrink. So, it\u2019s like aubergine goes like a really browny colour. But yeah, so we do that. I add on seasoning so salt, pepper, chilli powder. We add turmeric, erm, cumin. Oh gosh, what else do we add? Yeah, just th-those are the standard spices is what we add. Leave that to the side but like still ha-, keep it on low heat. And then we make the cheese sauce, which would be  <unintelligible> . Okay, so it\u2019s m-, butter and milk first, let it come to a simmer. Then add your two tablespoons of flour and then add, wait till it comes to a boi-, erm, comes to a boil? Yeah, so, when it starts bubbling, then you add all your cheese and I use like two hundred to three hundred grams of cheese just bec-, I like, er, I have this weird obsession with cheese. And, erm, yeah, so  <unintelligible>  that all in, you\u2019ve made your cheese sauce. Now, for the tomato sauce, we use tomato paste. We use a little bit of yoghurt, which isn\u2019t usually done in lasagne anyways but my family just like it like that. So, it\u2019s, erm, tomato paste and then also tinned tomatoes together. We add our seasonings into that as well, mostly chilli powder. We also use taco seasoning,  like the yea-, seasoning in our, erm, tomato sauce. I don\u2019t know why we do that. Then we add like a few, mm, diced peppers and stuff just to add some texture into the sauce. And then lastly, we have like the lasagne sheets. So, we don\u2019t make our own. I\u2019ve been trying to convince my family to buy a pasta machine but these guys don\u2019t want to listen to me. So, so, we get the ones where, erm, they\u2019re quite dry at first but you\u2019re meant to just put them into the baking tray but we don\u2019t do that. We, like a large bowl, fill that up with boiling water, let the pasta sheets soak in there until they\u2019re kind of soggy. But you\u2019re not mea-, you\u2019re not meant to do that but we do it anyway just because we\u2019re re-really scared that it\u2019s not going to cook. So then, each layer, so we put the, soak the pasta sheets, probably use a fork to like keep it dunked under the water, otherwise it sinks above. And then we have this huge lasagne like plate, I guess, and then we layer it. So, it goes pasta sheets, vegetables, tomato sauce, cheese sauce, another layer of pasta sheets and then we keep going in that consecutive order. And then at the top, we just add the cheese sauce all over it. Then the tomato goes on top. So, we do it in a different order. And then we just put a lot of like grated cheddar cheese on top. And then leave it in the oven for thirty to forty minutes until the top\u2019s all brown, take it out. By then the oven\u2019s hot so we use ready-made garlic bread and leave that in the oven for like eight to ten minutes and then by then, that\u2019s our meal completely done."]}

She\u2019s also, the teacher\u2019s also rolled their sleeves up, and she\u2019s got a black hairband on her right wrist, and she\u2019s let her blonde hair down. And erm, the student is sitting in the chair with her braids, and she\u2019s smiling quite a bit with her teeth showing as well. And erm, she\u2019s using her right hand to touch her chest, so I think they\u2019re just sharing a moment. So that\u2019s image one.

And they\u2019re both, er, sitting behind a Mac, and they\u2019re just looking at the computer. So I think they might be computing students or some type of technology involved in their, er, degrees also. Erm, the laptop\u2019s actually on a black sort of coffee table. And erm, yeah, it just looks like they\u2019re students on the same sort of course and, you know, just doing a bit of work together. So that\u2019s image two. And in image three, the background is almost a circle of white beads, o- placed on a black, er, background board. And it\u2019s got two, er, people in it. Er, one, er female and one male. Erm, she\u2019s wearing a leather black jacket and he\u2019s also g- holding a book. And I do believe there might be a third person in the picture but they\u2019re just out of the scene. So yeah, they\u2019re sitting on a, I think it\u2019s a red or sort of er, a rose type couch, and er, they\u2019ve got a glass coffee table in front of them. Er, the man\u2019s got a beard and, er, he\u2019s smiling quite a bit, with a green top under his black, er, inspector gadget jacket,  <laugh>  some people would say. Erm, he\u2019s wearing some, er, brown khaki trousers \u2013 no, brown trousers, yeah. And er, the lady\u2019s wearing some brown boots with red leggings, I would say. Erm, you can\u2019t really see it too caref- too well, but er, she\u2019s got some earrings I think, that are dangling. So er, yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it. So yeah, I would say they\u2019re, they\u2019re both students as well, because they\u2019ve got a book. And er, I don\u2019t know who the third character in the picture is as we can\u2019t really see, but we can just see one of his hands. But yeah.

Comparatively I will analyse how the concept of freedom is portrayed or even limited in the Quran. I will then investigate the theory of absolute freedom in liberalism through an Islamic perspective.

So, that\u2019s like the hefty like burgers where it\u2019s just, it looks dirty like you have the chicken, bacon, everything  <unintelligible>  and the mash and peas and then the milkshakes and the fries. So, oh, it makes me hungry now  <laugh> . But yeah, erm, that would, those\u2019d probably be my favourite cuisines but. Because I can\u2019t make it at home, I can only eat it out. So yeah, it\u2019s more finding the best places that do those cuisines and then experimenting. But yeah, those are my favourite, I would think.<new>My favourite dish to cook would probably be  <unintelligible> , let\u2019s say than vegetarian than vegie lasagne. So, instead of the minced meat, in my family we use aubergine, courgettes, peppers. Mm, er, I make a  <unintelligible>  I make one in cheese sauce and like the tomato sauce and then we have like pasta sheets. So yeah, that would be my favourite meal to, probably, cook, that with garlic bread. But, obviously, if I\u2019m at uni, I\u2019d be doing, because I don\u2019t eat beef either, I would mix that up with, erm, turkey mince, which is a really, or lamb mince, which is a really good alternative. Apart from that, I would probably also say tacos. Tacos are my favourite to make but instead of, obviously, using beef, like I only, erm, would use black beans. So like, erm, that\u2019s really nice. And then we make our own guacamole and it\u2019s like with, ah, I love that too. Yeah, those are like my two favourite things to make.<new>Okay, yeah, sure. So, with the lasagne, I\u2019d say the lasagne\u2019s definitely the more complicated one, we start off by so, you obviously chop your aubergines, courgettes, peppers, chop them all, may, preferably into slices. And then we roast but whilst we roast, we add like our oil. So, I use chilli oil just because I like mine spicy. And yeah, so we roast. We have like a sort of grill thing so we let it roast for quite some time till all the vegetables like shrink. So, it\u2019s like aubergine goes like a really browny colour. But yeah, so we do that. I add on seasoning so salt, pepper, chilli powder. We add turmeric, erm, cumin. Oh gosh, what else do we add? Yeah, just th-those are the standard spices is what we add. Leave that to the side but like still ha-, keep it on low heat. And then we make the cheese sauce, which would be  <unintelligible> . Okay, so it\u2019s m-, butter and milk first, let it come to a simmer. Then add your two tablespoons of flour and then add, wait till it comes to a boi-, erm, comes to a boil? Yeah, so, when it starts bubbling, then you add all your cheese and I use like two hundred to three hundred grams of cheese just bec-, I like, er, I have this weird obsession with cheese. And, erm, yeah, so  <unintelligible>  that all in, you\u2019ve made your cheese sauce. Now, for the tomato sauce, we use tomato paste. We use a little bit of yoghurt, which isn\u2019t usually done in lasagne anyways but my family just like it like that. So, it\u2019s, erm, tomato paste and then also tinned tomatoes together. We add our seasonings into that as well, mostly chilli powder. We also use taco seasoning,  like the yea-, seasoning in our, erm, tomato sauce. I don\u2019t know why we do that. Then we add like a few, mm, diced peppers and stuff just to add some texture into the sauce. And then lastly, we have like the lasagne sheets. So, we don\u2019t make our own. I\u2019ve been trying to convince my family to buy a pasta machine but these guys don\u2019t want to listen to me. So, so, we get the ones where, erm, they\u2019re quite dry at first but you\u2019re meant to just put them into the baking tray but we don\u2019t do that. We, like a large bowl, fill that up with boiling water, let the pasta sheets soak in there until they\u2019re kind of soggy. But you\u2019re not mea-, you\u2019re not meant to do that but we do it anyway just because we\u2019re re-really scared that it\u2019s not going to cook. So then, each layer, so we put the, soak the pasta sheets, probably use a fork to like keep it dunked under the water, otherwise it sinks above. And then we have this huge lasagne like plate, I guess, and then we layer it. So, it goes pasta sheets, vegetables, tomato sauce, cheese sauce, another layer of pasta sheets and then we keep going in that consecutive order. And then at the top, we just add the cheese sauce all over it. Then the tomato goes on top. So, we do it in a different order. And then we just put a lot of like grated cheddar cheese on top. And then leave it in the oven for thirty to forty minutes until the top\u2019s all brown, take it out. By then the oven\u2019s hot so we use ready-made garlic bread and leave that in the oven for like eight to ten minutes and then by then, that\u2019s our meal completely done.", "I think I have decided with regards to the <tattoo_design> tattoo that once it is healed if it is possible to just have it lasered off?

Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}

{"id": "eab79af1-69b1-4e9c-a962-1b1488a675dd", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl><nl>With the average person in the UK spending 110 minutes on social media, it is inevitable that content displayed across these platforms impact and influence societal norms. The nature of social media aids the ability for societal norms to not only be fueled and accepted across various cultures but also enable this to occur at an accelerated pace. However, the media has been proven to impact self-evaluation in a negative way. For example, there are numerous studies looking at women\u2019s self-evaluation, comparing weight-esteem based on neutral images or ideal images (Brown, Novick, Lord, &amp; Richards, 1992); self-worth based on social comparison (Jones &amp; Buckingham, 2005) etc. Unfortunately, looking at the effects on self-worth in men is minimal. This may be due to the rhetoric that portrays men as emotionless and when any type of emotion is displayed, idioms and phrases like \u2018be a man\u2019 or \u2018stop being a baby\u2019 comes into play. Due to this societal norm, it may make it difficult for men to be able to find appropriate support online and on social media platforms when struggling with the negative impact these sites can have on self worth. It is more acceptable for women to seek help online however, there is less support for men. By researching further into the impacts social media has on men\u2019s self worth, it can enable men to feel more comfortable when facing these issues. The research can aid understanding of this and also result in this topic becoming less taboo, giving a better chance for men to talk freely about their experiences.<nl><nl>I have investigated men\u2019s self worth in the context of social media and my main research question is \u2018How do young men talk about self worth within the context of social media (18-25)?\u2019. My method of analysis is discourse analysis as it allows for in-depth analysis into not only my participant\u2019s language use to construct ideas but also intonation. The interview will take place over a \u2018Zoom\u2019 video call, therefore I am able to have a video recording of all my participants' answers. <nl><nl>AnalysisResults<nl><nl>Through annotating my transcript I was able to select prominent themes that were discussed by my participant in the interview. These themes are spoken of throughout the interview and appear multiple times, even in different questions. From my initial question (line 7) I was able to determine that my participant is an avid user of social media, using it for entertainment purposes as well as using various platforms. This ensures that the questions I ask are relevant to my participant and the answers reflect their social media usage. <nl><nl>Key themes that were discussed by my participant include \"the ideal man\", involving image, appearance and social status; also \"alternate reality\", discussing not only the falseness of social media but also the construction of one's image on social media platforms.<nl><nl>The Ideal Man<nl><nl>The idea of \u2018the ideal man\u2019 featured within my participants answers multiple times, with a construction of what they personally believe to be the ideal man. As opposed to referring to what my participant feels they should look like, my participant instead suggests what others \"should be looking for\" (line 174) in a man, for example, the ideal height \"6 foot 4, or over 6 foot\" (line 175),  the ideal body, having \"six packs\" (line 138), adequate facial hair \"beard\" (line 176) etc. This is a very specific portrayal of men, suggesting that this is a common image for men to hold and strive to achieve. Although men do have an idea of what the ideal body type is they are also aware that in general life, this may not always be the case, with my participant stating that \"It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of me. It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of anyone I know.\" (line 162-163) when asked if he felt represented by men on social media. However, despite this acknowledgement, my participant still felt uncomfortable for comparisons between the appearance of men on social media and himself. My participant used the phrase \"I\u2019d prefer just to leave it at that\" (lines 161 and 294) indicating that men do feel uncomfortable about discussing their appearance, which supports the taboo of men expressing self-doubt and lacking self worth and lowered confidence. This would explain why my participant referred to other people he knows whenever talking about personal appearance, in order to make his answer generalised as opposed to solely him as well as deflect the discomfort about the fact that he is not the ideal man by justifying it with the fact that most people do not look like that. This is supported when he says \"I don\u2019t think many men would want to admit, especially among their peers, wouldn\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re not the ideal person.\" (lines 354-355) <nl><nl>In addition to the body image, a man\u2019s social status and financial status also seems to be prevalent when it comes to describing the \u2018ideal man\u2019 with my participant referring to men with \"seven figures\" (line 138), and men who have \"lavish\" (line 81 ) lifestyles. A given example was the actor and influencer \u2018Dan Bilzerian\u2019; well known for \"constantly flaunting a bunch of money\" (line 241) and \"constantly surrounded by money\". (line 242) This was someone who my participant would refer to as a \u2018role model\u2019 for most males. My participant also referred to the fact that \"men can be successful on social media without looking the greatest\" (line 225), due to their social and financial status. This is supported by the evolutionary psychology theory that women will desire men who are able to provide stability, in the forms of shelter, money, food etc. (Li, Li, Chan &amp; Zhang, 2016). This would explain that now in the digital age, men are able to attract attention with their wealth via social media through posting \"lavish\" (line 81) objects. As it is now commonplace for influencers to be posting this type of content, as my participant stated, \"ordinary people might look at that and think \u2018Well, that\u2019s not me\u2019.\"(line  So this becomes the new goals and the new norm. It is evident that the fact that my participant did not relate to these standards, as when asked if he felt represented by these role models and depictions of men he stated \"No. No. No. No I don\u2019t.\" (line 156) Being unable to relate to the norm often results in incongruence between one's actual self and ideal self which may lower self worth. (Rogers, 1959).<nl><nl>My participant states that they have changed themselves in order to conform with these standards, however wished not to elaborate on how he changed. Instead he referred to people that he knew of, talking about there being  \"a lot of men that will spend a bunch of time at the gym to try and achieve the body that every man wants.\" (lines 347-348) This emphasises that the pressures displayed online and on social media affects men enough for them to wish to change their lifestyle in order to relate to these standards. <nl><nl>Alternate Reality<nl><nl>Throughout my participants answers he refers to the fact that social media is \"not a true depiction\" (line 60) , is a \"very, very fake place\" (lines 104, 71, 63), \"is quite a negative place\" (lines 70, 84) , is \"not real\" (line 107) , is \"very unhealthy\" (line 117), has \"bad sides\" (line 123), is \"the furthest thing from real life\" (lines 147-148) etc. This is common in all the answers, and is said in multiple different ways. My participant referred to social media in very negative ways, and suggested it is a \"toxic\" (line 136) place, despite spending around \"5 hours\" (line 15) per day. This is not an uncommon amount of time on social media, however spending this much time surrounded by something that is perceived as negative by my participant, it is unsurprising that his self confidence is impacted. Also, despite this awareness of the fact that not everything is quite what it seems on social media, the standards are still internalised. This suggests that regardless of the reality or the accuracy of the things that one may be exposed to, they are still accepted by people and becomes the societal norm. My participant also refers to the fact that women are more educated about the ways images are distorted online as opposed to enhancements and photoshop for men.  <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl><nl>From my research, it is evident that despite being aware of the falseness and unrealistic standards of social media, it is evident that young men\u2019s self worth is impacted negatively by the content they are exposed to on social media. Despite being adamant that they are aware of the one sidedness of social media, men continue to make comparisons and draw from this to bring into real life situations. This makes it clear that men experience lowered self confidence not only looks wise but also based on their financial status, social status and more materialistic things. My research has also made it clear that men also feel pressure, and more should be done in terms of support for men online. However, regardless of the gender, social media does tend to display only positive events, making it harder for regular people to accept other events and negative things in real life.", "Dear <addr5_IN_SN>, <nl><nl>This email is in regards to the languages part of my course.

So, you could have a fish soup or a meat soup. I usually prefer the, the meat soups. So, erm, you could have a meat soup one with the  <dish1>  and er, yeah. And how you make it is that it\u2019s water mixed with the powder. So, it starts in a box and you just build the water up, pour the powder in and then just, you know, mix that together.

{"id": "af84e418-a267-4cbc-b95f-99bc88ea2b10", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl><nl>With the average person in the UK spending 110 minutes on social media, it is inevitable that content displayed across these platforms impact and influence societal norms. The nature of social media aids the ability for societal norms to not only be fueled and accepted across various cultures but also enable this to occur at an accelerated pace. However, the media has been proven to impact self-evaluation in a negative way. For example, there are numerous studies looking at women\u2019s self-evaluation, comparing weight-esteem based on neutral images or ideal images (Brown, Novick, Lord, &amp; Richards, 1992); self-worth based on social comparison (Jones &amp; Buckingham, 2005) etc. Unfortunately, looking at the effects on self-worth in men is minimal. This may be due to the rhetoric that portrays men as emotionless and when any type of emotion is displayed, idioms and phrases like \u2018be a man\u2019 or \u2018stop being a baby\u2019 comes into play. Due to this societal norm, it may make it difficult for men to be able to find appropriate support online and on social media platforms when struggling with the negative impact these sites can have on self worth. It is more acceptable for women to seek help online however, there is less support for men. By researching further into the impacts social media has on men\u2019s self worth, it can enable men to feel more comfortable when facing these issues. The research can aid understanding of this and also result in this topic becoming less taboo, giving a better chance for men to talk freely about their experiences.<nl><nl>I have investigated men\u2019s self worth in the context of social media and my main research question is \u2018How do young men talk about self worth within the context of social media (18-25)?\u2019. My method of analysis is discourse analysis as it allows for in-depth analysis into not only my participant\u2019s language use to construct ideas but also intonation. The interview will take place over a \u2018Zoom\u2019 video call, therefore I am able to have a video recording of all my participants' answers. <nl><nl>AnalysisResults<nl><nl>Through annotating my transcript I was able to select prominent themes that were discussed by my participant in the interview. These themes are spoken of throughout the interview and appear multiple times, even in different questions. From my initial question (line 7) I was able to determine that my participant is an avid user of social media, using it for entertainment purposes as well as using various platforms. This ensures that the questions I ask are relevant to my participant and the answers reflect their social media usage. <nl><nl>Key themes that were discussed by my participant include \"the ideal man\", involving image, appearance and social status; also \"alternate reality\", discussing not only the falseness of social media but also the construction of one's image on social media platforms.<nl><nl>The Ideal Man<nl><nl>The idea of \u2018the ideal man\u2019 featured within my participants answers multiple times, with a construction of what they personally believe to be the ideal man. As opposed to referring to what my participant feels they should look like, my participant instead suggests what others \"should be looking for\" (line 174) in a man, for example, the ideal height \"6 foot 4, or over 6 foot\" (line 175),  the ideal body, having \"six packs\" (line 138), adequate facial hair \"beard\" (line 176) etc. This is a very specific portrayal of men, suggesting that this is a common image for men to hold and strive to achieve. Although men do have an idea of what the ideal body type is they are also aware that in general life, this may not always be the case, with my participant stating that \"It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of me. It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of anyone I know.\" (line 162-163) when asked if he felt represented by men on social media. However, despite this acknowledgement, my participant still felt uncomfortable for comparisons between the appearance of men on social media and himself. My participant used the phrase \"I\u2019d prefer just to leave it at that\" (lines 161 and 294) indicating that men do feel uncomfortable about discussing their appearance, which supports the taboo of men expressing self-doubt and lacking self worth and lowered confidence. This would explain why my participant referred to other people he knows whenever talking about personal appearance, in order to make his answer generalised as opposed to solely him as well as deflect the discomfort about the fact that he is not the ideal man by justifying it with the fact that most people do not look like that. This is supported when he says \"I don\u2019t think many men would want to admit, especially among their peers, wouldn\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re not the ideal person.\" (lines 354-355) <nl><nl>In addition to the body image, a man\u2019s social status and financial status also seems to be prevalent when it comes to describing the \u2018ideal man\u2019 with my participant referring to men with \"seven figures\" (line 138), and men who have \"lavish\" (line 81 ) lifestyles. A given example was the actor and influencer \u2018Dan Bilzerian\u2019; well known for \"constantly flaunting a bunch of money\" (line 241) and \"constantly surrounded by money\". (line 242) This was someone who my participant would refer to as a \u2018role model\u2019 for most males. My participant also referred to the fact that \"men can be successful on social media without looking the greatest\" (line 225), due to their social and financial status. This is supported by the evolutionary psychology theory that women will desire men who are able to provide stability, in the forms of shelter, money, food etc. (Li, Li, Chan &amp; Zhang, 2016). This would explain that now in the digital age, men are able to attract attention with their wealth via social media through posting \"lavish\" (line 81) objects. As it is now commonplace for influencers to be posting this type of content, as my participant stated, \"ordinary people might look at that and think \u2018Well, that\u2019s not me\u2019.\"(line  So this becomes the new goals and the new norm. It is evident that the fact that my participant did not relate to these standards, as when asked if he felt represented by these role models and depictions of men he stated \"No. No. No. No I don\u2019t.\" (line 156) Being unable to relate to the norm often results in incongruence between one's actual self and ideal self which may lower self worth. (Rogers, 1959).<nl><nl>My participant states that they have changed themselves in order to conform with these standards, however wished not to elaborate on how he changed. Instead he referred to people that he knew of, talking about there being  \"a lot of men that will spend a bunch of time at the gym to try and achieve the body that every man wants.\" (lines 347-348) This emphasises that the pressures displayed online and on social media affects men enough for them to wish to change their lifestyle in order to relate to these standards. <nl><nl>Alternate Reality<nl><nl>Throughout my participants answers he refers to the fact that social media is \"not a true depiction\" (line 60) , is a \"very, very fake place\" (lines 104, 71, 63), \"is quite a negative place\" (lines 70, 84) , is \"not real\" (line 107) , is \"very unhealthy\" (line 117), has \"bad sides\" (line 123), is \"the furthest thing from real life\" (lines 147-148) etc. This is common in all the answers, and is said in multiple different ways. My participant referred to social media in very negative ways, and suggested it is a \"toxic\" (line 136) place, despite spending around \"5 hours\" (line 15) per day. This is not an uncommon amount of time on social media, however spending this much time surrounded by something that is perceived as negative by my participant, it is unsurprising that his self confidence is impacted. Also, despite this awareness of the fact that not everything is quite what it seems on social media, the standards are still internalised. This suggests that regardless of the reality or the accuracy of the things that one may be exposed to, they are still accepted by people and becomes the societal norm. My participant also refers to the fact that women are more educated about the ways images are distorted online as opposed to enhancements and photoshop for men.  <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl><nl>From my research, it is evident that despite being aware of the falseness and unrealistic standards of social media, it is evident that young men\u2019s self worth is impacted negatively by the content they are exposed to on social media. Despite being adamant that they are aware of the one sidedness of social media, men continue to make comparisons and draw from this to bring into real life situations. This makes it clear that men experience lowered self confidence not only looks wise but also based on their financial status, social status and more materialistic things. My research has also made it clear that men also feel pressure, and more should be done in terms of support for men online. However, regardless of the gender, social media does tend to display only positive events, making it harder for regular people to accept other events and negative things in real life.", "Erm, typically, I would say you can start from the night before so, usually would have a few snacks next to my bed on my table side, er, bed. So, I usually have, er, Maryland cookies or some type of random sweets or Twix or some type of candy or something and, er, usually with a Fanta on the side of it. So, I could wake up, go to the bathroom next door, brush my teeth and then come back, get a snack. So, that\u2019s just the start of the day as I'm just, you know, relaxing in my room. Then I\u2019ll go downstairs in about an hour or so, cook some breakfast so eggs, er, bread, beans, sausages and, you know, all the trimmings, bacon as well but I\u2019ve actually kind of reduced on that recently. So, then that\u2019s breakfast. And then usually, I\u2019d set off for the library so around, maybe, eleven, twelvish. And then, er, on the way to the library, I\u2019ll probably pick up a few things from  <supermarket1>  so, maybe, a meal deal and a few fruits and drinks and whatever. And then pretty much from midday till about five, maybe, I would have just had the meal deal and then I\u2019ll make my way home. And then when I get home, a cheeky little spaghetti bolognaise to start the night off. And then yeah, it just depends, really, when I sleep when I have my next meal but really and truly, it\u2019s probably another sort of snack, yeah. <new>In terms of, er, which one do I like the most or which one is most beneficial to me?<new>Oh. Before like, erm, I\u2019ve always liked breakfast, it\u2019s always been my, it\u2019s always been my favourite meal of the day, \u2018cause I, I, I learnt how to cook, erm, I learnt how to cook it quite early as well. I used to make eggs, the, the bread, the, warm up the beans, you know, I, I liked cooking breakfast. So, I would say yeah, that\u2019s the one I enjoy the most and yeah, I do think it is the most important as well, actually. Yeah, it sets up your day, you know?<new>I would say, mm, what\u2019s my favourite dish? Probably Sunday roast, I would say, yeah. And my mum makes it quite nice, actually, so. And it\u2019s not even just on Sundays we have it. In a week, typically, you\u2019d have it about twice. So, yeah, that is my favourite, with the potatoes, the sausages, chipolatas, to be specific. Chipolatas, er, gravy next to it, broccoli, carrots and, yeah, that\u2019s my favourite meal I would say."]}

So, you literally put it in the middle of the bowl and then you pour the soup around it and usually, depending on the type of soup it is, it might have different meats or fishes. So, you could have a fish soup or a meat soup. I usually prefer the, the meat soups. So, erm, you could have a meat soup one with the  <dish1>  and er, yeah.

One is sat down wearing a denim jacket, and she has twists in her hair. The other woman is wearing a black and white stripey top, dark blue jeans and a belt. So number one consists of the lady in the denim jacket sitting down, she\u2019s staring at something and her mouth is wide open. She has quite a surprised, but in a positive way, erm, her facial feature shows that she is looking at something which is surprising. And the other lady, on the right of her, is looking downwards towards something. Erm, also the lady with the black and white stripey top has medium length hair, is quite fair skinned, has dark brown hair going into more of an ombr\u00e9 blonde. Whereas the other lady sat down is, she is a Black lady, with black twists. Also, by the picture, it looks like the lady in the black and white top is showing er, her friend next to her, they look like they know each other. And yeah, they look like they\u2019re friends. They look like they are s- in some sort of maybe school environment. It\u2019s a casual environment, which is seen by the clothes that they are wearing. Another way this picture can also be seen is the lady in the denim jacket is looking, n-not looking at something that the girl in the black and white top is showing her, she\u2019s actually looking at something else, and that she\u2019s surprised by what she\u2019s seen because her mouth is wide open. In the second picture, it looks like erm, there are two boys in this picture. One is of South Asian descent, has short black hair and is wearing a black and red chequered shirt with a white top underneath, and there\u2019s a boy next to him on the, his left. And he\u2019s quite fair skinned, has a black ear piercing, and has short brown hair. He\u2019s wearing a top which consists of black and white flowers with red writing on top, but you can\u2019t read the writing. And the guy in the black and red sweatshirt is staring at a MacBook Air, and, er, looks really interested in what he is reading. Whereas his friend next to him is either staring at him, or there is something that\u2019s distracted him that\u2019s next to the guy in the black and red sweatshirt. From the looks of it, because of how close they are, they look like friends. And they look like university students, or a little bit older. They, yeah, they look around the age of between eighteen to er twenty-two. Yeah. In the background actually there are light green and dark green spots, with a black background, which looks like either a wallpaper or it looks like they\u2019re sitting down on a sofa which has that background. And the table that the MacBook is on is a wooden table with different shades of brown, giving it that timber sort of effect. Yeah. In the third picture, there is a Black female and on her left is a South Asian male. South Asian male has a beard and almost a buzz cut which has grown out. And he is wearing a dark green shirt with a long black coat that has buttons on the side, and also a long collar with beige trousers, dark beige trousers, and he is wearing black trainers. In the background of these two people there is a sort of spiral, almost hypnotising effect, sort of wallpaper. Which is, consists of many small, round, white circles across a black backdrop. The girl is wearing a black top with a black leather jacket, and is holding something in her hand, which I can\u2019t see it. Oh, she\u2019s holding something and it looks like there is also a hand in the picture, next to both of her hands. She\u2019s also wearing dark maroon leggings, with light brown leather boots. There is a table in front of them which has something on the glass table, which consists of either leaflets or pamphlets. And yeah, the male is also holding a book which he\u2019s gone through about, I\u2019d say, fifty per cent of. He looks like he\u2019s in the middle of the book; he looks like he\u2019s about to turn a page. They both are staring at the same thing, it looks like, because their eyes are in the same direction. They are both smiling. Erm, you can tell they\u2019re both quite comfortable with each other because of how close they are sat to each other. It looks like they are almost friends. It also looks like they may be students as well, because that looks like quite a big book. So yeah, number three has, you can tell they\u2019re both looking at something which makes them happy, or is something that is amusing to them. Because neither of them look confused. I-I think they both look eager to know more."]}

There\u2019s one woman standing and one woman sitting. Erm, one woman\u2019s wearing a striped black and white tee shirt with black jeans and one\u2019s wearing a denim jacket. One of them seems to be laughing and is looking at someone else, whereas one of them is looking down. The woman standing is the one wearing the striped tee shirt. She\u2019s also got blonde hair and seems to be involved in something. She looks busy. The other woman has braids and she seems to be engaged in conversation with someone and is laughing. The second image has two men. One of them is wearing a t-s-, checked shirt and the other is wearing a floral tee shirt. The one wearing the floral tee shirt is looking at the man wearing the stripe, er, the checked shirt. The one wearing the checked shirt is looking at a laptop. The laptop is a MacBook and it\u2019s on a table. The background is spotty. Erm, the background is spotty. The laptop is on the table. They seem like they\u2019re doing some type of work but nothing too stressful because the one in the shirt is smiling and so is the one in the tee shirt. In the third image, two people are sitting next to each other. One\u2019s a woman and one\u2019s a man. They\u2019re both wearing jackets. The woman\u2019s wearing a bl-black leather jacket with a black tee shirt and red jeans with some boots. The man\u2019s wearing a grey jacket with a green tee shirt and brown trousers. The man is holding a book and they\u2019re both looking at the same person. You can see the person\u2019s hand in the corner. There\u2019s, in the background, there\u2019s more spots but they\u2019re in a circle. And they both seem happy because they\u2019re smiling."]}

And it looks so disgusting whilst he\u2019s making it. But like the f-, end product, like it looks amazing and it looks like it tastes really good. And the thing is like, erm, like, I, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not vegan or I\u2019m not vegetarian or anything but my boyfriend is. So, like, I feel bad whenever I\u2019m like eating like a burger or like something like that near him. Like he doesn\u2019t mind but like at the same time, I feel like, I feel bad so then like I\u2019ve been trying to, you know, like not be vegetarian but trying to eat a bit more like vegetarian. 'Cause not only is it like good for the environment and stuff like, a lot of people around me are vegetarian, so like my parents are vegetarian, like my boyfriend\u2019s vegetarian now, my, like a lot of my friends have become vegetarian as well. So, I feel like it would help. But like, I feel like I like meat a lot so having that would be amazing.

So, I would prioritise that like before my food so like I will go like, I remember like, I, it doesn\u2019t happen as much now because I\u2019ve been at home quite a lot because of, erm, like just out of ease and\u2026 but like in my first year, I used to eat like noodles all the time and my friends would be like, \"Yeah, we\u2019re eating this, like we\u2019ve prepped these meals,\" and I\u2019d be like, \"Yeah, no, that\u2019s not happening.\" But I feel like I\u2019d be able to, I\u2019d eat out a lot more than I do now and I feel like... I don\u2019t feel like my, like my taste would change as much as it would just be like I\u2019d eat out really  <laugh>  more and like I\u2019d probably end up drinking way more or like not having to drink like, when it comes to like, I feel like with like normal like drinks and stuff like it\u2019s fine but like when it comes to alcohol, like I feel like I do try and like choose the cheapest option and I feel like it\u2019s so easy to just like, to find expensive drinks that you do end up liking. So, like, I\u2019d probably end up spending like too much money on drinking like, mm. But the thing is like the more expensive alcohol is, I feel like it tastes better or like, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just me or like if it actually is or if it\u2019s just like a placebo type thing where it\u2019s like, \"Oh, it\u2019s more expensive so it tastes better.\" But I don\u2019t know, I feel like I\u2019d spend a lot of money on going out and drinking.", "New liberalism was born after a new wave of liberals in the late 19th century to the early 20th century challenged the positions of classical liberals such as Adam Smith and John Locke. Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}
{"id": "6a5b3e4b-24b4-4af8-a305-b1c33cff4fea03814", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl><nl>With the average person in the UK spending 110 minutes on social media, it is inevitable that content displayed across these platforms impact and influence societal norms. The nature of social media aids the ability for societal norms to not only be fueled and accepted across various cultures but also enable this to occur at an accelerated pace. However, the media has been proven to impact self-evaluation in a negative way. For example, there are numerous studies looking at women\u2019s self-evaluation, comparing weight-esteem based on neutral images or ideal images (Brown, Novick, Lord, &amp; Richards, 1992); self-worth based on social comparison (Jones &amp; Buckingham, 2005) etc. Unfortunately, looking at the effects on self-worth in men is minimal. This may be due to the rhetoric that portrays men as emotionless and when any type of emotion is displayed, idioms and phrases like \u2018be a man\u2019 or \u2018stop being a baby\u2019 comes into play. Due to this societal norm, it may make it difficult for men to be able to find appropriate support online and on social media platforms when struggling with the negative impact these sites can have on self worth. It is more acceptable for women to seek help online however, there is less support for men. By researching further into the impacts social media has on men\u2019s self worth, it can enable men to feel more comfortable when facing these issues. The research can aid understanding of this and also result in this topic becoming less taboo, giving a better chance for men to talk freely about their experiences.<nl><nl>I have investigated men\u2019s self worth in the context of social media and my main research question is \u2018How do young men talk about self worth within the context of social media (18-25)?\u2019. My method of analysis is discourse analysis as it allows for in-depth analysis into not only my participant\u2019s language use to construct ideas but also intonation. The interview will take place over a \u2018Zoom\u2019 video call, therefore I am able to have a video recording of all my participants' answers. <nl><nl>AnalysisResults<nl><nl>Through annotating my transcript I was able to select prominent themes that were discussed by my participant in the interview. These themes are spoken of throughout the interview and appear multiple times, even in different questions. From my initial question (line 7) I was able to determine that my participant is an avid user of social media, using it for entertainment purposes as well as using various platforms. This ensures that the questions I ask are relevant to my participant and the answers reflect their social media usage. <nl><nl>Key themes that were discussed by my participant include \"the ideal man\", involving image, appearance and social status; also \"alternate reality\", discussing not only the falseness of social media but also the construction of one's image on social media platforms.<nl><nl>The Ideal Man<nl><nl>The idea of \u2018the ideal man\u2019 featured within my participants answers multiple times, with a construction of what they personally believe to be the ideal man. As opposed to referring to what my participant feels they should look like, my participant instead suggests what others \"should be looking for\" (line 174) in a man, for example, the ideal height \"6 foot 4, or over 6 foot\" (line 175),  the ideal body, having \"six packs\" (line 138), adequate facial hair \"beard\" (line 176) etc. This is a very specific portrayal of men, suggesting that this is a common image for men to hold and strive to achieve. Although men do have an idea of what the ideal body type is they are also aware that in general life, this may not always be the case, with my participant stating that \"It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of me. It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of anyone I know.\" (line 162-163) when asked if he felt represented by men on social media. However, despite this acknowledgement, my participant still felt uncomfortable for comparisons between the appearance of men on social media and himself. My participant used the phrase \"I\u2019d prefer just to leave it at that\" (lines 161 and 294) indicating that men do feel uncomfortable about discussing their appearance, which supports the taboo of men expressing self-doubt and lacking self worth and lowered confidence. This would explain why my participant referred to other people he knows whenever talking about personal appearance, in order to make his answer generalised as opposed to solely him as well as deflect the discomfort about the fact that he is not the ideal man by justifying it with the fact that most people do not look like that. This is supported when he says \"I don\u2019t think many men would want to admit, especially among their peers, wouldn\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re not the ideal person.\" (lines 354-355) <nl><nl>In addition to the body image, a man\u2019s social status and financial status also seems to be prevalent when it comes to describing the \u2018ideal man\u2019 with my participant referring to men with \"seven figures\" (line 138), and men who have \"lavish\" (line 81 ) lifestyles. A given example was the actor and influencer \u2018Dan Bilzerian\u2019; well known for \"constantly flaunting a bunch of money\" (line 241) and \"constantly surrounded by money\". (line 242) This was someone who my participant would refer to as a \u2018role model\u2019 for most males. My participant also referred to the fact that \"men can be successful on social media without looking the greatest\" (line 225), due to their social and financial status. This is supported by the evolutionary psychology theory that women will desire men who are able to provide stability, in the forms of shelter, money, food etc. (Li, Li, Chan &amp; Zhang, 2016). This would explain that now in the digital age, men are able to attract attention with their wealth via social media through posting \"lavish\" (line 81) objects. As it is now commonplace for influencers to be posting this type of content, as my participant stated, \"ordinary people might look at that and think \u2018Well, that\u2019s not me\u2019.\"(line  So this becomes the new goals and the new norm. It is evident that the fact that my participant did not relate to these standards, as when asked if he felt represented by these role models and depictions of men he stated \"No. No. No. No I don\u2019t.\" (line 156) Being unable to relate to the norm often results in incongruence between one's actual self and ideal self which may lower self worth. (Rogers, 1959).<nl><nl>My participant states that they have changed themselves in order to conform with these standards, however wished not to elaborate on how he changed. Instead he referred to people that he knew of, talking about there being  \"a lot of men that will spend a bunch of time at the gym to try and achieve the body that every man wants.\" (lines 347-348) This emphasises that the pressures displayed online and on social media affects men enough for them to wish to change their lifestyle in order to relate to these standards. <nl><nl>Alternate Reality<nl><nl>Throughout my participants answers he refers to the fact that social media is \"not a true depiction\" (line 60) , is a \"very, very fake place\" (lines 104, 71, 63), \"is quite a negative place\" (lines 70, 84) , is \"not real\" (line 107) , is \"very unhealthy\" (line 117), has \"bad sides\" (line 123), is \"the furthest thing from real life\" (lines 147-148) etc. This is common in all the answers, and is said in multiple different ways. My participant referred to social media in very negative ways, and suggested it is a \"toxic\" (line 136) place, despite spending around \"5 hours\" (line 15) per day. This is not an uncommon amount of time on social media, however spending this much time surrounded by something that is perceived as negative by my participant, it is unsurprising that his self confidence is impacted. Also, despite this awareness of the fact that not everything is quite what it seems on social media, the standards are still internalised. This suggests that regardless of the reality or the accuracy of the things that one may be exposed to, they are still accepted by people and becomes the societal norm. My participant also refers to the fact that women are more educated about the ways images are distorted online as opposed to enhancements and photoshop for men.  <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl><nl>From my research, it is evident that despite being aware of the falseness and unrealistic standards of social media, it is evident that young men\u2019s self worth is impacted negatively by the content they are exposed to on social media. Despite being adamant that they are aware of the one sidedness of social media, men continue to make comparisons and draw from this to bring into real life situations. This makes it clear that men experience lowered self confidence not only looks wise but also based on their financial status, social status and more materialistic things. My research has also made it clear that men also feel pressure, and more should be done in terms of support for men online. However, regardless of the gender, social media does tend to display only positive events, making it harder for regular people to accept other events and negative things in real life.", "Dear <addr14_FN>,<nl>I would like to attend the 2pm site tour.<nl>Thank you,<nl><part_FN><new>Dear <addr14_FN>,<nl>I am able to attend today.<nl>Thank you,<nl><part_FN><new>Dear Mrs. <addr15_SN>,<nl>I hope you and your family are well during these times.

{"id": "24bc6fff-8547-443b-978c-87d3de32711407205", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["New liberalism was born after a new wave of liberals in the late 19th century to the early 20th century challenged the positions of classical liberals such as Adam Smith and John Locke. Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state.", "We\u2019ve got a as WhatsApp group for the <module> essay.

This is because from day one it has always been difficult to fully close it - partly due to the design of the cupboard door and the fact that the freezer isn\u2019t working properly and as a result the ice builds up and doesn\u2019t allow it to close. This further prevents the fridge from closing properly in addition to the cupboard design door. This ongoing issue has resulted in numerous amounts of food not being kept properly and the unfortunate throwing away of them. We are all experiencing hard times as we attempt to continue living with COVID19, therefore the continuous cycle of buying food and it going off due to a dysfucntional and ineffective fridge makes these times just that much harder.<nl><nl>A contractor was sent out once and the service he provided was not good enough as this is still a very important issue - if not the most important as it directly effects our health and safety.<nl><nl>Another issue in the kitchen is that one of the lower cabinet doors has come off. I believe the inside components have snapped and the repair will require new parts.<nl><nl>The last of the issues in the kitchen is the metal wall section behind the sink. The bottom part of it has opened and essentially began to peel off. This also needs to be fixed because if its allowed to continue peeling the wall behind it will start to get wet from the sink and cause further damage to the property.<nl><nl>In line with maintenance requests, it has also been brought to my attention that the top floor tenant is extremely unhappy with the mattress she is having to use as she says all she can feel is the springs within it. This causes severe joint and shoulder pain - again this is important as it has a direct impact on her health. If this could be replaced it would be most helpful, as we are timely paying tenants who don\u2019t believe this to be an unjust request.<nl><nl>I did contact the <business> property management mobile contact number ending 152, I was directed to report all maintenance issues through property file. However, we were not given access to this platform and so can\u2019t use it.

Thai food or, I would say Thai food, Chinese or American soul. It literally depends on my mood. So, Thai food, red Thai curry, the spicier the better, whereas you can also have prawn toast. I think prawn toast is more of a Chinese sort of thing but that, I love Chinese cuisine as well, Singapore fried rice. And then you have American soul food. So, that\u2019s like the hefty like burgers where it\u2019s just, it looks dirty like you have the chicken, bacon, everything  <unintelligible>  and the mash and peas and then the milkshakes and the fries. So, oh, it makes me hungry now  <laugh> . But yeah, erm, that would, those\u2019d probably be my favourite cuisines but. Because I can\u2019t make it at home, I can only eat it out. So yeah, it\u2019s more finding the best places that do those cuisines and then experimenting. But yeah, those are my favourite, I would think.<new>My favourite dish to cook would probably be  <unintelligible> , let\u2019s say than vegetarian than vegie lasagne. So, instead of the minced meat, in my family we use aubergine, courgettes, peppers. Mm, er, I make a  <unintelligible>  I make one in cheese sauce and like the tomato sauce and then we have like pasta sheets. So yeah, that would be my favourite meal to, probably, cook, that with garlic bread. But, obviously, if I\u2019m at uni, I\u2019d be doing, because I don\u2019t eat beef either, I would mix that up with, erm, turkey mince, which is a really, or lamb mince, which is a really good alternative. Apart from that, I would probably also say tacos. Tacos are my favourite to make but instead of, obviously, using beef, like I only, erm, would use black beans. So like, erm, that\u2019s really nice. And then we make our own guacamole and it\u2019s like with, ah, I love that too. Yeah, those are like my two favourite things to make.<new>Okay, yeah, sure. So, with the lasagne, I\u2019d say the lasagne\u2019s definitely the more complicated one, we start off by so, you obviously chop your aubergines, courgettes, peppers, chop them all, may, preferably into slices. And then we roast but whilst we roast, we add like our oil. So, I use chilli oil just because I like mine spicy. And yeah, so we roast. We have like a sort of grill thing so we let it roast for quite some time till all the vegetables like shrink. So, it\u2019s like aubergine goes like a really browny colour. But yeah, so we do that. I add on seasoning so salt, pepper, chilli powder. We add turmeric, erm, cumin. Oh gosh, what else do we add? Yeah, just th-those are the standard spices is what we add. Leave that to the side but like still ha-, keep it on low heat. And then we make the cheese sauce, which would be  <unintelligible> . Okay, so it\u2019s m-, butter and milk first, let it come to a simmer. Then add your two tablespoons of flour and then add, wait till it comes to a boi-, erm, comes to a boil? Yeah, so, when it starts bubbling, then you add all your cheese and I use like two hundred to three hundred grams of cheese just bec-, I like, er, I have this weird obsession with cheese. And, erm, yeah, so  <unintelligible>  that all in, you\u2019ve made your cheese sauce. Now, for the tomato sauce, we use tomato paste. We use a little bit of yoghurt, which isn\u2019t usually done in lasagne anyways but my family just like it like that. So, it\u2019s, erm, tomato paste and then also tinned tomatoes together. We add our seasonings into that as well, mostly chilli powder. We also use taco seasoning,  like the yea-, seasoning in our, erm, tomato sauce. I don\u2019t know why we do that. Then we add like a few, mm, diced peppers and stuff just to add some texture into the sauce. And then lastly, we have like the lasagne sheets. So, we don\u2019t make our own. I\u2019ve been trying to convince my family to buy a pasta machine but these guys don\u2019t want to listen to me. So, so, we get the ones where, erm, they\u2019re quite dry at first but you\u2019re meant to just put them into the baking tray but we don\u2019t do that. We, like a large bowl, fill that up with boiling water, let the pasta sheets soak in there until they\u2019re kind of soggy. But you\u2019re not mea-, you\u2019re not meant to do that but we do it anyway just because we\u2019re re-really scared that it\u2019s not going to cook. So then, each layer, so we put the, soak the pasta sheets, probably use a fork to like keep it dunked under the water, otherwise it sinks above. And then we have this huge lasagne like plate, I guess, and then we layer it. So, it goes pasta sheets, vegetables, tomato sauce, cheese sauce, another layer of pasta sheets and then we keep going in that consecutive order. And then at the top, we just add the cheese sauce all over it. Then the tomato goes on top. So, we do it in a different order. And then we just put a lot of like grated cheddar cheese on top. And then leave it in the oven for thirty to forty minutes until the top\u2019s all brown, take it out. By then the oven\u2019s hot so we use ready-made garlic bread and leave that in the oven for like eight to ten minutes and then by then, that\u2019s our meal completely done.", "I\u2019m not in your group anymore, you\u2019re going to have to contact them individually<new>Hey!

We have also discussed that once we believe we have completed our set tasks we will organize a zoom call in which we will collaborate and discuss our findings together, so everyone understands each other's task and how we came to our certain conclusions. <nl><nl>We have stated we are going to have weekly catch ups in which we will talk about every group member's progress and if they are struggling with anything, or if they would like to discuss anything with us.

We do not want to make any of our group members feel like they cannot talk to us, especially if they are struggling.

Er, one white female and another Black female. And I can just tell by the way the\u2026 okay, so the background is white as well, and the, the white female\u2019s standing up and almost bending over, and er, I can see it\u2019s a sort of teacher and student relationship. And they\u2019re both, you know, quite smiling a bit, so, erm. She\u2019s also, the teacher\u2019s also rolled their sleeves up, and she\u2019s got a black hairband on her right wrist, and she\u2019s let her blonde hair down. And erm, the student is sitting in the chair with her braids, and she\u2019s smiling quite a bit with her teeth showing as well. And erm, she\u2019s using her right hand to touch her chest, so I think they\u2019re just sharing a moment. So that\u2019s image one. And erm,  <misc>  in image two, there\u2019s a white background with a sort of uni, er, couch setup. And there\u2019s two males; er, one who\u2019s got a black earring in his left ear, and er, another who\u2019s also wearing a red, er, red shirt over a white, er, t-shirt. And they\u2019re both, er, sitting behind a Mac, and they\u2019re just looking at the computer. So I think they might be computing students or some type of technology involved in their, er, degrees also. Erm, the laptop\u2019s actually on a black sort of coffee table. And erm, yeah, it just looks like they\u2019re students on the same sort of course and, you know, just doing a bit of work together. So that\u2019s image two. And in image three, the background is almost a circle of white beads, o- placed on a black, er, background board. And it\u2019s got two, er, people in it. Er, one, er female and one male. Erm, she\u2019s wearing a leather black jacket and he\u2019s also g- holding a book. And I do believe there might be a third person in the picture but they\u2019re just out of the scene. So yeah, they\u2019re sitting on a, I think it\u2019s a red or sort of er, a rose type couch, and er, they\u2019ve got a glass coffee table in front of them. Er, the man\u2019s got a beard and, er, he\u2019s smiling quite a bit, with a green top under his black, er, inspector gadget jacket,  <laugh>  some people would say. Erm, he\u2019s wearing some, er, brown khaki trousers \u2013 no, brown trousers, yeah. And er, the lady\u2019s wearing some brown boots with red leggings, I would say. Erm, you can\u2019t really see it too caref- too well, but er, she\u2019s got some earrings I think, that are dangling. So er, yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it. So yeah, I would say they\u2019re, they\u2019re both students as well, because they\u2019ve got a book. And er, I don\u2019t know who the third character in the picture is as we can\u2019t really see, but we can just see one of his hands. But yeah. And there\u2019s a leaflet on the glass coffee table in front of them. And that\u2019s it for picture three."]}
{"id": "6845f392-06fb-4099-bb56-7abe75f748e708221", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["The Modern State is seen to have five key features: sovereignty, public institutions, territorial association, legitimation and domination (D\u2019Amato, 2018). These characteristics can be highlighted as territory (an area with defined borders), external and internal sovereignty where a state must be able to defend its territory and not be too dependent on another power. A state achieves sovereignty when it is recognised by the family of states as the \u2018sole governing authority within its territory and as the legal equal of other states\u2019 (The Modern State, 2020). Furthermore, there has to be legitimacy in which there is recognised rule, examples of this are traditional legitimacy, charismatic legitimacy and rational-legal legitimacy; the legitimacy enhances a state\u2019s sovereignty at a lower cost. The last characteristic is modern bureaucracy, this is required to generate as well as collect revenue. In this essay we will be discussing and critically examining Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, who criticizes the moralistic view of authority. Machiavelli although seen as an evil man, had a large influence on the future of modern civilisation especially in comparison to the artists of his time. <nl><nl>For Machiavelli, moral basis on which to judge the difference between illegitimate and legitimate uses of power does not exist, arguing that this does not add to the actual possession of power \u2013 rather the legitimacy rests upon the threat of coercive force. His beliefs rest in those that the leaders should avoid the common values of justice and mercy in preference to the use of violence and fear, particularly if it is in the best interest such as through gaining and expanding political power. Historians have stated Machiavelli to be the \u2018teacher of evil\u2019 such as Leo Strauss (McShea, 1963). However, Machiavelli has been credited with formulating the \"modern concept of the state\", that is understood in the Weberian sense of a \u2018form of rule possessing a monopoly of coercive authority within a set territorial boundary\u2019 (Nederman, 2019). Machiavelli derived his views from the experience of the Caesura Borgia.  However, Machiavelli did contribute to the way we understand the modern state now as he proposed his own conception of the \"civil principality\" whilst subverting his previous medieval idea of state as regime (Sellers,2015). However, it should be noted that force is not the only weapon to rule the people so his argument can be seen as psychologically weak.<nl><nl>Machiavelli also states that principality can be seen to be governed by a single ruler and is helped by anointed ministers which is the case in many current states seen today. Machiavelli states that the idea of taking over depends on the character of region than the character of the prince, he has the strong belief that the citizens will recollect and fight for their liberty. Although we have grown out of medieval brutality, it can be argued that the modern-day equivalent of killing is to send rivals to jail or allow opponents to lose if there is indecisiveness. An example of this is Brexit, where the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was seen as indecisive and therefore could not gain enough votes in time for the referendum. Another way Machiavelli is modernised is through the idea that leaders will need to make severe decisions, such as through firing a member of the cabinet. An example of this is the Night of Long Knives in 1962 where Macmillan sacked a third of his cabinet. Nevertheless, Machiavelli ignored individualism and had one sided views of human nature which can be viewed as a critical flaw.<nl><nl>For Machiavelli, law is also impossible to follow without the required military as arms are a requirement in order for leaders to establish great frameworks. Although it can be criticised as we do not follow medieval combat, there are still some aspects which apply to the modern state, for instance the concept that an army from your own principality is most beneficial for defending yourself \u2013 and this concept is universally accepted. Machiavelli also made the point that there is conflict of interest which can be seen in the modern state also, for example through the leak of the Panama papers. What is also seen in the modern state is Machiavelli\u2019s view on auxiliary troops being faithful to someone else, for example through the rise of the Taliban, as although it was intended for the Taliban to fight the Soviet Union, they later turned and became the lead terrorist group. In Antonio Negri\u2019s view, Machiavelli belongs to a \u2018political alternative of modern thought grounded on a revolutionary version of constituent power\u2019 (Negri and Maurizia Boscagli, 2009). However, Quentin Skinner and J.G.A Pocock write that we should regard Machiavelli as part of the republican tradition, i.e. as part of the living legacy of Aristotelian philosophy (Roecklein, 2012). Nonetheless, Machiavelli was the first modern thinker to have thought of the State as an independent entity and not recognising any religious organisation exterior to it and The Prince has been a choice of several political leaders such as Louis XIV, Napoleon Bonaparte and Benito Mussolini. <nl><nl>The modern state was \u2018constituted by an abstraction from personal to impersonal rule\u2019 (Mansfield, 1983). With Machiavelli we encounter a challenge to the classical regime which is expressed in his use of stato (his stato is someone\u2019s to acquire), whereas for Aristotle\u2019s regime there is some ordering of the inhabitants of the city. The central theme of Machiavelli\u2019s political ideas is power with absolute state being the end. The state is viewed as superior to all associations and is sovereign as well as autonomous however he also stated that religion cannot influence politics and the church cannot control the state, which is not the case. <nl><nl>Comparing Machiavelli to other theorists allows for us to critically evaluate him further. Plato had the vision of every human being born into a division which was maintained and creating an arrangement for the state in the course of classism whereas Machiavelli proposed with the aim of sovereignty to support the nation in which the leader controls and protects its citizens. Machiavelli\u2019s concept of virt\u00fa highlights the utilitarian needs of the country. For Machiavelli virt\u00fa outweighs virtue in times of need whilst Plato believes a \u2018just ruler must behave the same at all times\u2019 however we have to consider they were writing in different eras, as Plato\u2019s philosophy is based on utopian principles and Machiavelli is viewed as a realist (Abrams, M, 2017). Aristotle divides government into two categories: good and bad with good forms fall aristocracy and under bad fall oligarchy. Aristotle wanted to help society achieve goodness through politics whereas on the other hand Machiavelli sought to achieve the maintenance of power and stability. They have differing views in terms of Aristotle claimed that if an entire state is made to fear their ruler, this would cause unhappiness however Machiavelli suggested that it is better to be feared than loved as it creates balance. However, they are on similar sides when it comes to liberation, as in the Prince it stated such ruler should not dictate the actions of others, but all together Machiavelli was seeking a practical type of politics whilst Aristotle took a rather idealistic approach (Tabone, 2020).  <nl><nl>Hobbes and Machiavelli have fascinating ideas on human nature impacting the state as the common theme is the usage of fear, meaning power needs to be acquired and maintained but we have to remember that Machiavelli\u2019s time period involved the peak of absolutism and hierarchies. Philosophers such a John Locke have directly opposing views on government. Locke\u2019s perception of revolt as a right gave people excessive power compared to the government, this did not exist during the time of Machiavelli. Locke believed in the idea of the government working for the people, however this is directly opposed to Machiavelli\u2019s thought that the ruler should do what it takes to remain in power (Chris Joseph, 2014). Machiavelli recommended that coercion should be used in order to govern whereas Locke favoured a social contract with the concept of dual accountability. Although Machiavelli\u2019s concept of coercion is flawed, he did recognise that rulers could not govern by this alone and advocated for the use of cunning and subterfuge, Locke\u2019s social contract did not contain an element of this. Machiavelli had a pessimistic view of individuals and believed human beings are fundamentally bad whereas Locke was more optimistic. In the modern state it follows Machiavelli\u2019s model more as the rulers in the modern state are comprised of the rich and powerful in society. Mill and Machiavelli also have the same solution to government in freedom of speech, they are both aware that people cannot have a hand in ruling itself. <nl><nl>Political leaders and their followers believed that Machiavellism was a disease infesting the politic body. He is still regarded with a negative reputation, but he still aids us to understand the modern state. Machiavelli promoted the central role of a citizen in preserving institutions which is reflected through the meaning of the Second Amendment in the U.S. Constitution (Bernard, 2009). Among modern believers of Machiavelli, there are Burmese generals such as Web Jiabao, the Former Premier of China and Lord Mandelson (Bernard, 2009). Machiavelli and Pareto agree in terms of this where they say egotism or selfishness as a natural property of the human species (Femia, 2013). According to Machiavellism though, the principle aim of prince is the unification as well as welfare of the state which showed reality of practical politics. He deduced that the internal unity and powerful government were the essential of any state by observing the affairs of the interstate rivalries. The sole aim of the prince is also to increase power in ways such as to be an expert in managing and organising a war- power is seen as the only reason of the state. <nl><nl>To conclude Machiavelli contributes to the \u2018comprehension of constituent power as a living force within social order\u2019 (Lucchese, 2016). He developed a revolutionary position, suggesting that political conflict is not a destabilising factor, but rather the grounding force of free republics. His concepts and ideas are often misunderstood as he displayed rare intellect to become a partisan in an age where absolute monarchy held control (Mathur, 1991). All together Machiavelli was the first thinker who justified secular state and the first advocate for autonomy for the state. He unfairly became associated with evil through his critical work written about The Prince, and although it did not get translated until almost a hundred years later the negative view about Machiavelli had already been established into Elizabethan England. All together he communicated priority to the state and put it above morality and religion as it is the highest form of social organisation and most essential to promote human welfare, and this is seen clearly in the modern state. Machiavelli\u2019s Prince dealt exclusively with the interests of a single person of power that focuses on only the leader\u2019s welfare in mind whereas the theories of Plato, Aristotle, Locke and Mill dealt with the welfare of society. However, in the modern state there Machiavelli did consider that the Prince needed to maintain good relations with the people which is what we observe. It can be agreed the way that Machiavelli talks about the state as Machiavelli was a realist.", "<unintelligible><new>It was crazy. When your body gets used to not eating meat, you will feel sick when you eat it after a long time. And I didn\u2019t know that was a thing, \u2018cause.<new>Yeah, it was, I could not, I have nit, I was sweating when the room was cold, it was so bad. Like my parents were like, \"What is wrong with you? Like do you have Covid?\" I didn\u2019t have Covid, it was just \u2018cause I ate meat. Yeah, I know, it was bad  <laugh> .<new>So, I think I would one hundred percent cut milk out of my diet. If I could find a dairy free alternative for cheese, I would. I think the benefits of eating fish, however, are underestimated. So, I think I would actually keep fit in my diet but I would cut out the pork completely. I don\u2019t eat beef anyway, so that\u2019s not a problem, I just stick to chicken and fish and try and cut out dairy. I think if I had, if I had them, all the money and I didn\u2019t have like restrictions upon my household, that\u2019s what I would do. But I would also try and find different alternatives. So, sugar wise as well. I eat a lot of refined sugar and it can have a really bad impact on my, my skin and how I feel as well. And I think another,  <unintelligible>  was looking into it. So, I was, erm, pardon me, I used to do food tech back when I did my GCSEs and then last year, erm, I don\u2019t know, have you heard of  <restaurant5> ? It\u2019s right next to  <university> .<new>I, I was a chef there first year of uni.<new>Yeah, I was a chef there and I loved it. I don\u2019t know how I got the job but yeah, so. And I was seeing what was literally put into all these meals because I was the one making them, I was serving them. And, erm, I just realised that  <unintelligible>  . So, I looked up, erm, like coconut as a substitute and I would look at other substitutes. They are a li-little bit more expensive. Or even this brown sugar, stuff like that, just trying to like, yeah, less, less refined the better, obviously. So yeah, I reckon I would start looking up sugar alternatives if I had a  <unintelligible> , I had the money. Yeah."]}

Thai food or, I would say Thai food, Chinese or American soul. It literally depends on my mood. So, Thai food, red Thai curry, the spicier the better, whereas you can also have prawn toast. I think prawn toast is more of a Chinese sort of thing but that, I love Chinese cuisine as well, Singapore fried rice. And then you have American soul food. So, that\u2019s like the hefty like burgers where it\u2019s just, it looks dirty like you have the chicken, bacon, everything  <unintelligible>  and the mash and peas and then the milkshakes and the fries. So, oh, it makes me hungry now  <laugh> . But yeah, erm, that would, those\u2019d probably be my favourite cuisines but. Because I can\u2019t make it at home, I can only eat it out. So yeah, it\u2019s more finding the best places that do those cuisines and then experimenting. But yeah, those are my favourite, I would think.<new>My favourite dish to cook would probably be  <unintelligible> , let\u2019s say than vegetarian than vegie lasagne. So, instead of the minced meat, in my family we use aubergine, courgettes, peppers. Mm, er, I make a  <unintelligible>  I make one in cheese sauce and like the tomato sauce and then we have like pasta sheets. So yeah, that would be my favourite meal to, probably, cook, that with garlic bread. But, obviously, if I\u2019m at uni, I\u2019d be doing, because I don\u2019t eat beef either, I would mix that up with, erm, turkey mince, which is a really, or lamb mince, which is a really good alternative. Apart from that, I would probably also say tacos. Tacos are my favourite to make but instead of, obviously, using beef, like I only, erm, would use black beans. So like, erm, that\u2019s really nice. And then we make our own guacamole and it\u2019s like with, ah, I love that too. Yeah, those are like my two favourite things to make.<new>Okay, yeah, sure. So, with the lasagne, I\u2019d say the lasagne\u2019s definitely the more complicated one, we start off by so, you obviously chop your aubergines, courgettes, peppers, chop them all, may, preferably into slices. And then we roast but whilst we roast, we add like our oil. So, I use chilli oil just because I like mine spicy. And yeah, so we roast. We have like a sort of grill thing so we let it roast for quite some time till all the vegetables like shrink. So, it\u2019s like aubergine goes like a really browny colour. But yeah, so we do that. I add on seasoning so salt, pepper, chilli powder. We add turmeric, erm, cumin. Oh gosh, what else do we add? Yeah, just th-those are the standard spices is what we add. Leave that to the side but like still ha-, keep it on low heat. And then we make the cheese sauce, which would be  <unintelligible> . Okay, so it\u2019s m-, butter and milk first, let it come to a simmer. Then add your two tablespoons of flour and then add, wait till it comes to a boi-, erm, comes to a boil? Yeah, so, when it starts bubbling, then you add all your cheese and I use like two hundred to three hundred grams of cheese just bec-, I like, er, I have this weird obsession with cheese. And, erm, yeah, so  <unintelligible>  that all in, you\u2019ve made your cheese sauce. Now, for the tomato sauce, we use tomato paste. We use a little bit of yoghurt, which isn\u2019t usually done in lasagne anyways but my family just like it like that. So, it\u2019s, erm, tomato paste and then also tinned tomatoes together. We add our seasonings into that as well, mostly chilli powder. We also use taco seasoning,  like the yea-, seasoning in our, erm, tomato sauce. I don\u2019t know why we do that. Then we add like a few, mm, diced peppers and stuff just to add some texture into the sauce. And then lastly, we have like the lasagne sheets. So, we don\u2019t make our own. I\u2019ve been trying to convince my family to buy a pasta machine but these guys don\u2019t want to listen to me. So, so, we get the ones where, erm, they\u2019re quite dry at first but you\u2019re meant to just put them into the baking tray but we don\u2019t do that. We, like a large bowl, fill that up with boiling water, let the pasta sheets soak in there until they\u2019re kind of soggy. But you\u2019re not mea-, you\u2019re not meant to do that but we do it anyway just because we\u2019re re-really scared that it\u2019s not going to cook. So then, each layer, so we put the, soak the pasta sheets, probably use a fork to like keep it dunked under the water, otherwise it sinks above. And then we have this huge lasagne like plate, I guess, and then we layer it. So, it goes pasta sheets, vegetables, tomato sauce, cheese sauce, another layer of pasta sheets and then we keep going in that consecutive order. And then at the top, we just add the cheese sauce all over it. Then the tomato goes on top. So, we do it in a different order. And then we just put a lot of like grated cheddar cheese on top. And then leave it in the oven for thirty to forty minutes until the top\u2019s all brown, take it out. By then the oven\u2019s hot so we use ready-made garlic bread and leave that in the oven for like eight to ten minutes and then by then, that\u2019s our meal completely done.", "Good evening, <nl><nl>As our research question is <assignment_title><nl><nl>The essay structure outline is that <pers1_FN_SN> is doing 18th century politics and John Locke's interpretation, I am doing McCarthyism and the influence this had on socialism in the United States, <pers2_FN_SN1_SN2> is doing a paragraph on Communism and the Cold War, <pers3_FN_SN> is doing a paragraph on the American empire and the successes of American Capitalism. <nl><nl>Also, <pers4_FN_SN> has not responded to my email and it has been two weeks, we are not sure what to do. <nl><nl><nl><nl>Thank you, kind regards.<nl><nl><part_FN><nl><student_number><new>Please could my group and I have the slot for 1:40pm on the <DDth> <month>, if that is not available is it possible if we could have the 1:20pm slot. <nl><nl>From <part_FN> (<student_number>) <nl><nl>My group is: <part_FN>, <pers1_FN>, <pers2_FN>. <new>1:20 is perfect thank you<new>Good afternoon, to whoever this may concern<nl>My name is <part_FN_SN>, and I attend <city>- <university>. <nl>My customer ID is <id_number>.<nl><nl>I am requesting for my next instalment on &lt;DDMMYY&gt; to be made void please, and I will remove all of my belongings from my room and the kitchen by the <DDth> of <month>.

So the Black lady ha- is wearing a black top with a black leather jacket, burgundy trousers and brown boots. The Asian boy is wearing a green t-shirt with a grey and black coat. He is holding an open book and he\u2019s wearing beige bottoms with black trainers. They are both looking to the side and they both have a happy expression on their face. You can see someone else\u2019s hands in the picture, to the side that they\u2019re looking.

Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}

The nature of social media aids the ability for societal norms to not only be fueled and accepted across various cultures but also enable this to occur at an accelerated pace. However, the media has been proven to impact self-evaluation in a negative way. For example, there are numerous studies looking at women\u2019s self-evaluation, comparing weight-esteem based on neutral images or ideal images (Brown, Novick, Lord, &amp; Richards, 1992); self-worth based on social comparison (Jones &amp; Buckingham, 2005) etc. Unfortunately, looking at the effects on self-worth in men is minimal. This may be due to the rhetoric that portrays men as emotionless and when any type of emotion is displayed, idioms and phrases like \u2018be a man\u2019 or \u2018stop being a baby\u2019 comes into play. Due to this societal norm, it may make it difficult for men to be able to find appropriate support online and on social media platforms when struggling with the negative impact these sites can have on self worth. It is more acceptable for women to seek help online however, there is less support for men. By researching further into the impacts social media has on men\u2019s self worth, it can enable men to feel more comfortable when facing these issues. The research can aid understanding of this and also result in this topic becoming less taboo, giving a better chance for men to talk freely about their experiences.<nl><nl>I have investigated men\u2019s self worth in the context of social media and my main research question is \u2018How do young men talk about self worth within the context of social media (18-25)?\u2019. My method of analysis is discourse analysis as it allows for in-depth analysis into not only my participant\u2019s language use to construct ideas but also intonation. The interview will take place over a \u2018Zoom\u2019 video call, therefore I am able to have a video recording of all my participants' answers. <nl><nl>AnalysisResults<nl><nl>Through annotating my transcript I was able to select prominent themes that were discussed by my participant in the interview. These themes are spoken of throughout the interview and appear multiple times, even in different questions. From my initial question (line 7) I was able to determine that my participant is an avid user of social media, using it for entertainment purposes as well as using various platforms. This ensures that the questions I ask are relevant to my participant and the answers reflect their social media usage. <nl><nl>Key themes that were discussed by my participant include \"the ideal man\", involving image, appearance and social status; also \"alternate reality\", discussing not only the falseness of social media but also the construction of one's image on social media platforms.<nl><nl>The Ideal Man<nl><nl>The idea of \u2018the ideal man\u2019 featured within my participants answers multiple times, with a construction of what they personally believe to be the ideal man. As opposed to referring to what my participant feels they should look like, my participant instead suggests what others \"should be looking for\" (line 174) in a man, for example, the ideal height \"6 foot 4, or over 6 foot\" (line 175),  the ideal body, having \"six packs\" (line 138), adequate facial hair \"beard\" (line 176) etc. This is a very specific portrayal of men, suggesting that this is a common image for men to hold and strive to achieve. Although men do have an idea of what the ideal body type is they are also aware that in general life, this may not always be the case, with my participant stating that \"It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of me. It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of anyone I know.\" (line 162-163) when asked if he felt represented by men on social media. However, despite this acknowledgement, my participant still felt uncomfortable for comparisons between the appearance of men on social media and himself. My participant used the phrase \"I\u2019d prefer just to leave it at that\" (lines 161 and 294) indicating that men do feel uncomfortable about discussing their appearance, which supports the taboo of men expressing self-doubt and lacking self worth and lowered confidence. This would explain why my participant referred to other people he knows whenever talking about personal appearance, in order to make his answer generalised as opposed to solely him as well as deflect the discomfort about the fact that he is not the ideal man by justifying it with the fact that most people do not look like that. This is supported when he says \"I don\u2019t think many men would want to admit, especially among their peers, wouldn\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re not the ideal person.\" (lines 354-355) <nl><nl>In addition to the body image, a man\u2019s social status and financial status also seems to be prevalent when it comes to describing the \u2018ideal man\u2019 with my participant referring to men with \"seven figures\" (line 138), and men who have \"lavish\" (line 81 ) lifestyles. A given example was the actor and influencer \u2018Dan Bilzerian\u2019; well known for \"constantly flaunting a bunch of money\" (line 241) and \"constantly surrounded by money\". (line 242) This was someone who my participant would refer to as a \u2018role model\u2019 for most males. My participant also referred to the fact that \"men can be successful on social media without looking the greatest\" (line 225), due to their social and financial status. This is supported by the evolutionary psychology theory that women will desire men who are able to provide stability, in the forms of shelter, money, food etc. (Li, Li, Chan &amp; Zhang, 2016). This would explain that now in the digital age, men are able to attract attention with their wealth via social media through posting \"lavish\" (line 81) objects. As it is now commonplace for influencers to be posting this type of content, as my participant stated, \"ordinary people might look at that and think \u2018Well, that\u2019s not me\u2019.\"(line  So this becomes the new goals and the new norm. It is evident that the fact that my participant did not relate to these standards, as when asked if he felt represented by these role models and depictions of men he stated \"No. No. No. No I don\u2019t.\" (line 156) Being unable to relate to the norm often results in incongruence between one's actual self and ideal self which may lower self worth. (Rogers, 1959).<nl><nl>My participant states that they have changed themselves in order to conform with these standards, however wished not to elaborate on how he changed. Instead he referred to people that he knew of, talking about there being  \"a lot of men that will spend a bunch of time at the gym to try and achieve the body that every man wants.\" (lines 347-348) This emphasises that the pressures displayed online and on social media affects men enough for them to wish to change their lifestyle in order to relate to these standards. <nl><nl>Alternate Reality<nl><nl>Throughout my participants answers he refers to the fact that social media is \"not a true depiction\" (line 60) , is a \"very, very fake place\" (lines 104, 71, 63), \"is quite a negative place\" (lines 70, 84) , is \"not real\" (line 107) , is \"very unhealthy\" (line 117), has \"bad sides\" (line 123), is \"the furthest thing from real life\" (lines 147-148) etc. This is common in all the answers, and is said in multiple different ways. My participant referred to social media in very negative ways, and suggested it is a \"toxic\" (line 136) place, despite spending around \"5 hours\" (line 15) per day. This is not an uncommon amount of time on social media, however spending this much time surrounded by something that is perceived as negative by my participant, it is unsurprising that his self confidence is impacted. Also, despite this awareness of the fact that not everything is quite what it seems on social media, the standards are still internalised. This suggests that regardless of the reality or the accuracy of the things that one may be exposed to, they are still accepted by people and becomes the societal norm. My participant also refers to the fact that women are more educated about the ways images are distorted online as opposed to enhancements and photoshop for men.  <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl><nl>From my research, it is evident that despite being aware of the falseness and unrealistic standards of social media, it is evident that young men\u2019s self worth is impacted negatively by the content they are exposed to on social media. Despite being adamant that they are aware of the one sidedness of social media, men continue to make comparisons and draw from this to bring into real life situations. This makes it clear that men experience lowered self confidence not only looks wise but also based on their financial status, social status and more materialistic things. My research has also made it clear that men also feel pressure, and more should be done in terms of support for men online. However, regardless of the gender, social media does tend to display only positive events, making it harder for regular people to accept other events and negative things in real life.", "Dear <addr16_FN>,<nl>I have been looking for the <location> and am unable to find it, I have asked the main reception as well as the other <organisation> reception.

Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}

Your choice. ", "The first picture is of two women. One is sat down wearing a denim jacket, and she has twists in her hair. The other woman is wearing a black and white stripey top, dark blue jeans and a belt. So number one consists of the lady in the denim jacket sitting down, she\u2019s staring at something and her mouth is wide open. She has quite a surprised, but in a positive way, erm, her facial feature shows that she is looking at something which is surprising. And the other lady, on the right of her, is looking downwards towards something. Erm, also the lady with the black and white stripey top has medium length hair, is quite fair skinned, has dark brown hair going into more of an ombr\u00e9 blonde. Whereas the other lady sat down is, she is a Black lady, with black twists. Also, by the picture, it looks like the lady in the black and white top is showing er, her friend next to her, they look like they know each other. And yeah, they look like they\u2019re friends. They look like they are s- in some sort of maybe school environment. It\u2019s a casual environment, which is seen by the clothes that they are wearing. Another way this picture can also be seen is the lady in the denim jacket is looking, n-not looking at something that the girl in the black and white top is showing her, she\u2019s actually looking at something else, and that she\u2019s surprised by what she\u2019s seen because her mouth is wide open. In the second picture, it looks like erm, there are two boys in this picture. One is of South Asian descent, has short black hair and is wearing a black and red chequered shirt with a white top underneath, and there\u2019s a boy next to him on the, his left. And he\u2019s quite fair skinned, has a black ear piercing, and has short brown hair. He\u2019s wearing a top which consists of black and white flowers with red writing on top, but you can\u2019t read the writing. And the guy in the black and red sweatshirt is staring at a MacBook Air, and, er, looks really interested in what he is reading. Whereas his friend next to him is either staring at him, or there is something that\u2019s distracted him that\u2019s next to the guy in the black and red sweatshirt. From the looks of it, because of how close they are, they look like friends. And they look like university students, or a little bit older. They, yeah, they look around the age of between eighteen to er twenty-two. Yeah. In the background actually there are light green and dark green spots, with a black background, which looks like either a wallpaper or it looks like they\u2019re sitting down on a sofa which has that background. And the table that the MacBook is on is a wooden table with different shades of brown, giving it that timber sort of effect. Yeah. In the third picture, there is a Black female and on her left is a South Asian male. South Asian male has a beard and almost a buzz cut which has grown out. And he is wearing a dark green shirt with a long black coat that has buttons on the side, and also a long collar with beige trousers, dark beige trousers, and he is wearing black trainers. In the background of these two people there is a sort of spiral, almost hypnotising effect, sort of wallpaper. Which is, consists of many small, round, white circles across a black backdrop. The girl is wearing a black top with a black leather jacket, and is holding something in her hand, which I can\u2019t see it. Oh, she\u2019s holding something and it looks like there is also a hand in the picture, next to both of her hands. She\u2019s also wearing dark maroon leggings, with light brown leather boots. There is a table in front of them which has something on the glass table, which consists of either leaflets or pamphlets. And yeah, the male is also holding a book which he\u2019s gone through about, I\u2019d say, fifty per cent of. He looks like he\u2019s in the middle of the book; he looks like he\u2019s about to turn a page. They both are staring at the same thing, it looks like, because their eyes are in the same direction. They are both smiling. Erm, you can tell they\u2019re both quite comfortable with each other because of how close they are sat to each other. It looks like they are almost friends. It also looks like they may be students as well, because that looks like quite a big book. So yeah, number three has, you can tell they\u2019re both looking at something which makes them happy, or is something that is amusing to them. Because neither of them look confused. I-I think they both look eager to know more."]}

She\u2019s also, the teacher\u2019s also rolled their sleeves up, and she\u2019s got a black hairband on her right wrist, and she\u2019s let her blonde hair down.

Erm, he\u2019s wearing some, er, brown khaki trousers \u2013 no, brown trousers, yeah. And er, the lady\u2019s wearing some brown boots with red leggings, I would say. Erm, you can\u2019t really see it too caref- too well, but er, she\u2019s got some earrings I think, that are dangling. So er, yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it.

Erm, my favourite restaurant, I would say, is  <restaurant1>  and my go to dish from there would be ebi katsu and, er, the chicken curry with the rice.

Then, er, the actual chicken curry is just rice underneath it all and it\u2019s covered by quite a few vegetables, a few sauces and the actual chicken, you know, mixed in a curry sauce.

So, it all just came together quite nicely, actually. <new>Yeah. Yeah, I do. So, it\u2019s like a doughy, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s a circle and it\u2019s like a doughy type thing so you can literally just, er, pick it up with your hands. And you eat it with a sort of, erm, soup. So, you literally put it in the middle of the bowl and then you pour the soup around it and usually, depending on the type of soup it is, it might have different meats or fishes. So, you could have a fish soup or a meat soup. I usually prefer the, the meat soups. So, erm, you could have a meat soup one with the  <dish1>  and er, yeah. And how you make it is that it\u2019s water mixed with the powder. So, it starts in a box and you just build the water up, pour the powder in and then just, you know, mix that together.

So, I could wake up, go to the bathroom next door, brush my teeth and then come back, get a snack. So, that\u2019s just the start of the day as I'm just, you know, relaxing in my room. Then I\u2019ll go downstairs in about an hour or so, cook some breakfast so eggs, er, bread, beans, sausages and, you know, all the trimmings, bacon as well but I\u2019ve actually kind of reduced on that recently. So, then that\u2019s breakfast. And then usually, I\u2019d set off for the library so around, maybe, eleven, twelvish. And then, er, on the way to the library, I\u2019ll probably pick up a few things from  <supermarket1>  so, maybe, a meal deal and a few fruits and drinks and whatever. And then pretty much from midday till about five, maybe, I would have just had the meal deal and then I\u2019ll make my way home.

And then yeah, it just depends, really, when I sleep when I have my next meal but really and truly, it\u2019s probably another sort of snack, yeah. <new>In terms of, er, which one do I like the most or which one is most beneficial to me?<new>Oh.

{"id": "f8c958a1-604f-42d5-b90c-c7c8c648722a07466", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["New liberalism was born after a new wave of liberals in the late 19th century to the early 20th century challenged the positions of classical liberals such as Adam Smith and John Locke. Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state.", "Dear <addr5_IN_SN>, <nl><nl>This email is in regards to the languages part of my course.

It looks as though the Black lady is- still she\u2019s sat down, and the white lady is stood up, possibly on a laptop. And they look, the Black lady looks surprised, so the white lady could be helping her with some work or something, and she looks shocked and surprised, but they both look happy and smiling.

That is all three pictures.", "New liberalism was born after a new wave of liberals in the late 19th century to the early 20th century challenged the positions of classical liberals such as Adam Smith and John Locke. Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}

Due to contralateral processing, P3 should remain inattentive when shown a stimuli on the left. By using EEG, alpha activity can be recorded when shown a stimuli cued left or cued right. Event markers allow for it to be clear when the participant is shown the stimuli, and the alpha activity was recorded. The results showed that there was a significantly higher in left than right cue condition, and supported the hypothesis.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha activity refers to electrical impulses oscillating at 8-13Hz , this is an alpha wave. These brain waves begin in the cerebral cortex (Moini &amp; Piran, 2020) and occur during periods of inattention, where one is in a restful state, whilst being awake, examples of this is when closing eyes, meditating (Lagopoulos et al., 2009), daydreaming etc.  When the brain begins to focus on stimuli, alpha waves are suppressed. The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007), proposes that high alpha indicates disengagement and inhibition of task irrelevant brain areas. In task relevant brain areas, alpha remains low, supporting that alpha activity is modulated by attention.  <nl><nl>This hypothesis is supported by Magosso et al, 2019, which used a regular setting and a VR (virtual reality) setting to see if the intensity of the task and the levels of attention required affects alpha frequency. The results showed that alpha signals are suppressed when having to give attention to tasks although it seems that when isolated from all external features (when participating in VR) alpha activity becomes greater. This suggests that it is the modulation and diversion of attention which causes changes in alpha frequencies.<nl><nl>Sauseng et al (2005) presented participants with directional cues indicating which hemifield the target stimuli would appear in. The target stimuli consisted of either small or large bars which participants identified and responded with \u2018s\u2019 for small and \u2018l\u2019 for large. Results showed that there was stronger alpha frequency suppression in brain areas contralateral to the targeted hemifield. This is due to visual stimuli being processed contralaterally. 200ms before the stimuli was presented, in active processing areas like the parietal lobe (P3), the alpha range is also lower. This study is supportive of AIM (Klimesch et al, 2007), and is used as the basis for this experiment, as it is a partial replication. In this experiment, the focus will be on the effect of arrow cues, specifically the direction they are facing.<nl><nl>Hypothesis<nl>As AIH states, alpha range activity is present in areas that are uninvolved in active processing and is suppressed in areas that actively process. By directing attention, and cueing the participant to expect the stimuli in a specific region they will begin paying attention. As shown by Sauseng et al (2005), visual stimuli is processed contralaterally resulting in alpha suppression in the other side of the brain. For example, if the stimuli is present in the left visual field it will be processed by the right hemisphere. By using the left parietal cortex (P3) to record alpha activity, it is expected that alpha activity will be greater when a stimulus is shown on the left and for this activity to be suppressed when the stimuli is on the right.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 undergraduate students were participants chosen from an opportunity sample.<nl><nl>Design<nl>This experiment uses a within subjects design. The dependent variable is the alpha range amplitudes (microvolts) on the left hand side of the parietal lobe (P3). The independent variable is the direction of the arrow cue, with two levels, left or right. <nl>Materials<nl>This experiment used a Biopac MP36 to collect data, EEG electrodes, AC Cream, Abrasive paste, PsychoPy to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device and stimuli (see figure 1). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG by opening the Biopac student lab. From the \u2018analog\u2019 tab select Electroencaphagram (EEG)\u2019 \u20180.5-100Hz wnotch\u2019, so the 50Hz band is filtered out. Digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker.. The \u2018calculation\u2019 tab allowed alpha frequency to be recorded. Then select \u2018EEG alpha 8-13Hz\u2019 from the drop down list. The sampling rate was 1000Hz. The participant was then prepared to be attached to the EEG. The electrode sites were abraded with everi cream using a cotton bud, and then AC cream was put on the electrodes. The electrodes are placed using the 1020 system. The active electrode was placed on P3. Participants were then given a cued visual task. A fixation cross was cued at the centre of the screen for 34ms, followed by an arrow indicating where to focus attention, with a 50% chance of it being cued left or right. There was then an interval of 600-800ms followed by a fixation cross for the second time, finally the participant was shown the target stimuli for 50ms, either a large or small white bar against a black background. Participants were then asked to use the keyboard to respond to the stimuli, typing either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. 75% of the trials were valid (the target stimuli was presented in the same hemifield that the arrow cue indicated), and 25% were invalid (the target stimuli was presented in the other hemifield). There were 20 blocks of the four trial types (cue left with a small bar, cue right with a small bar, cue left with a large bar and cue right with a large bar) so in total there were 80 trials.<nl><nl>Results<nl>There were transformations applied to the raw 9-13Hz alpha EEG data. There were eventmarkers received by PsychoPy through the Stimtracker, in order to identify when the stimuli was presented to the participants. The data also was used to specifically analyse from 200ms prior to stimulus onset after the directional arrow cues had been shown. Furthermore, the data was rectified, making negative values positive despite them showing excitatory or inhibitory activity. The samples were also averaged in order to limit the impact that outlying values would have on the data. This data is referred to as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl><nl>Descriptive Statistics<nl><table><nl><nl>Inferential Statistics <nl>The wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T=566, n=38, p=.002).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results of this experiment show that there was a significantly higher level of alpha activity when the stimulus was shown on the left hand side, this fit the original hypothesis. These results are consistent with AIH (Klimesch et al, 2007) as it shows that when participants are given a stimulus in their left hemifield, due to contralateral processing, this is processed by the right part of brain areas. As we were looking at P3, the left side of the parietal lobe, when shown a cue on the left it was processed on the right, meaning the left was task irrelevant and inattentive, resulting in higher alpha activity.<nl><nl>Methodological Problems<nl>Factors which may have confounded data include artefacts, which is when the EEG is contaminated by excess movement. When eye movements take place, the electrical activity could be recorded as brain activity. Eye movements could be blinking or horizontal eye movement, especially when having to look at either side of the screen. Blinking could also pose other issues such as the participant missing the cue. However, it does not seem to be too much of an issue and repetition and more trials would minimise the effects of this.<nl>Another issue could be the laboratory setting, as this could have an affect on brain activity. This is not a very normal situation for participants to be placed in so they may be uncomfortable or more alert as they know they are being studied. This could impact the EEG recordings as it is not a life-like situation so the results may not be generalisable to the whole population.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Overall, the data is valid despite minor methodological issues, which after replication can minimise the effect of individual differences, such as blinking and horizontal eye movement. The data also supports AIH and produced the expected results.", "Go to order. Er, this is quite a recent one as well, actually.

The one wearing the floral tee shirt is looking at the man wearing the stripe, er, the checked shirt. The one wearing the checked shirt is looking at a laptop. The laptop is a MacBook and it\u2019s on a table. The background is spotty. Erm, the background is spotty. The laptop is on the table. They seem like they\u2019re doing some type of work but nothing too stressful because the one in the shirt is smiling and so is the one in the tee shirt. In the third image, two people are sitting next to each other. One\u2019s a woman and one\u2019s a man. They\u2019re both wearing jackets. The woman\u2019s wearing a bl-black leather jacket with a black tee shirt and red jeans with some boots. The man\u2019s wearing a grey jacket with a green tee shirt and brown trousers. The man is holding a book and they\u2019re both looking at the same person. You can see the person\u2019s hand in the corner.

Due to contralateral processing, P3 should remain inattentive when shown a stimuli on the left. By using EEG, alpha activity can be recorded when shown a stimuli cued left or cued right. Event markers allow for it to be clear when the participant is shown the stimuli, and the alpha activity was recorded. The results showed that there was a significantly higher in left than right cue condition, and supported the hypothesis.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha activity refers to electrical impulses oscillating at 8-13Hz , this is an alpha wave. These brain waves begin in the cerebral cortex (Moini &amp; Piran, 2020) and occur during periods of inattention, where one is in a restful state, whilst being awake, examples of this is when closing eyes, meditating (Lagopoulos et al., 2009), daydreaming etc.  When the brain begins to focus on stimuli, alpha waves are suppressed. The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007), proposes that high alpha indicates disengagement and inhibition of task irrelevant brain areas. In task relevant brain areas, alpha remains low, supporting that alpha activity is modulated by attention.  <nl><nl>This hypothesis is supported by Magosso et al, 2019, which used a regular setting and a VR (virtual reality) setting to see if the intensity of the task and the levels of attention required affects alpha frequency. The results showed that alpha signals are suppressed when having to give attention to tasks although it seems that when isolated from all external features (when participating in VR) alpha activity becomes greater. This suggests that it is the modulation and diversion of attention which causes changes in alpha frequencies.<nl><nl>Sauseng et al (2005) presented participants with directional cues indicating which hemifield the target stimuli would appear in. The target stimuli consisted of either small or large bars which participants identified and responded with \u2018s\u2019 for small and \u2018l\u2019 for large. Results showed that there was stronger alpha frequency suppression in brain areas contralateral to the targeted hemifield. This is due to visual stimuli being processed contralaterally. 200ms before the stimuli was presented, in active processing areas like the parietal lobe (P3), the alpha range is also lower. This study is supportive of AIM (Klimesch et al, 2007), and is used as the basis for this experiment, as it is a partial replication. In this experiment, the focus will be on the effect of arrow cues, specifically the direction they are facing.<nl><nl>Hypothesis<nl>As AIH states, alpha range activity is present in areas that are uninvolved in active processing and is suppressed in areas that actively process. By directing attention, and cueing the participant to expect the stimuli in a specific region they will begin paying attention. As shown by Sauseng et al (2005), visual stimuli is processed contralaterally resulting in alpha suppression in the other side of the brain. For example, if the stimuli is present in the left visual field it will be processed by the right hemisphere. By using the left parietal cortex (P3) to record alpha activity, it is expected that alpha activity will be greater when a stimulus is shown on the left and for this activity to be suppressed when the stimuli is on the right.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 undergraduate students were participants chosen from an opportunity sample.<nl><nl>Design<nl>This experiment uses a within subjects design. The dependent variable is the alpha range amplitudes (microvolts) on the left hand side of the parietal lobe (P3). The independent variable is the direction of the arrow cue, with two levels, left or right. <nl>Materials<nl>This experiment used a Biopac MP36 to collect data, EEG electrodes, AC Cream, Abrasive paste, PsychoPy to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device and stimuli (see figure 1). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG by opening the Biopac student lab. From the \u2018analog\u2019 tab select Electroencaphagram (EEG)\u2019 \u20180.5-100Hz wnotch\u2019, so the 50Hz band is filtered out. Digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker.. The \u2018calculation\u2019 tab allowed alpha frequency to be recorded. Then select \u2018EEG alpha 8-13Hz\u2019 from the drop down list. The sampling rate was 1000Hz. The participant was then prepared to be attached to the EEG. The electrode sites were abraded with everi cream using a cotton bud, and then AC cream was put on the electrodes. The electrodes are placed using the 1020 system. The active electrode was placed on P3. Participants were then given a cued visual task. A fixation cross was cued at the centre of the screen for 34ms, followed by an arrow indicating where to focus attention, with a 50% chance of it being cued left or right. There was then an interval of 600-800ms followed by a fixation cross for the second time, finally the participant was shown the target stimuli for 50ms, either a large or small white bar against a black background. Participants were then asked to use the keyboard to respond to the stimuli, typing either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. 75% of the trials were valid (the target stimuli was presented in the same hemifield that the arrow cue indicated), and 25% were invalid (the target stimuli was presented in the other hemifield). There were 20 blocks of the four trial types (cue left with a small bar, cue right with a small bar, cue left with a large bar and cue right with a large bar) so in total there were 80 trials.<nl><nl>Results<nl>There were transformations applied to the raw 9-13Hz alpha EEG data. There were eventmarkers received by PsychoPy through the Stimtracker, in order to identify when the stimuli was presented to the participants. The data also was used to specifically analyse from 200ms prior to stimulus onset after the directional arrow cues had been shown. Furthermore, the data was rectified, making negative values positive despite them showing excitatory or inhibitory activity. The samples were also averaged in order to limit the impact that outlying values would have on the data. This data is referred to as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl><nl>Descriptive Statistics<nl><table><nl><nl>Inferential Statistics <nl>The wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T=566, n=38, p=.002).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results of this experiment show that there was a significantly higher level of alpha activity when the stimulus was shown on the left hand side, this fit the original hypothesis. These results are consistent with AIH (Klimesch et al, 2007) as it shows that when participants are given a stimulus in their left hemifield, due to contralateral processing, this is processed by the right part of brain areas. As we were looking at P3, the left side of the parietal lobe, when shown a cue on the left it was processed on the right, meaning the left was task irrelevant and inattentive, resulting in higher alpha activity.<nl><nl>Methodological Problems<nl>Factors which may have confounded data include artefacts, which is when the EEG is contaminated by excess movement. When eye movements take place, the electrical activity could be recorded as brain activity. Eye movements could be blinking or horizontal eye movement, especially when having to look at either side of the screen. Blinking could also pose other issues such as the participant missing the cue. However, it does not seem to be too much of an issue and repetition and more trials would minimise the effects of this.<nl>Another issue could be the laboratory setting, as this could have an affect on brain activity. This is not a very normal situation for participants to be placed in so they may be uncomfortable or more alert as they know they are being studied. This could impact the EEG recordings as it is not a life-like situation so the results may not be generalisable to the whole population.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Overall, the data is valid despite minor methodological issues, which after replication can minimise the effect of individual differences, such as blinking and horizontal eye movement. The data also supports AIH and produced the expected results.", "dear dr. <addr7_SN><nl>I'm so so sorry but I forgot to hand in my homework and I just looked in my bag and my book is here but I've done it.

{"id": "6c67f550-3a42-4261-a735-42a968af66fd08165", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["New liberalism was born after a new wave of liberals in the late 19th century to the early 20th century challenged the positions of classical liberals such as Adam Smith and John Locke. Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state.", "To whom this may concern,<nl><nl>My name is <part_FN_SN> and I\u2019m a student on the course of <course>.<nl><nl>Following the results release the link for my results has been removed from my <system>.<nl>I was trying to access it to see the next steps I need to take as it has information of deferred modules and referred modules.<nl><nl>Could you please re instate the link on my <system> or assist with me the deffered examination dates and other such information.<nl><nl>Hope to hear from you soon.<nl><nl>Kind regards,<nl><nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hi <addr1_NN>, <nl>There are reading lists that are given to you for each module - so dependant on what modules you picked and if they are some of the ones I did, I could potentially give you a head start and send you the corresponding reading lists.

So, that\u2019s like the hefty like burgers where it\u2019s just, it looks dirty like you have the chicken, bacon, everything  <unintelligible>  and the mash and peas and then the milkshakes and the fries. So, oh, it makes me hungry now  <laugh> . But yeah, erm, that would, those\u2019d probably be my favourite cuisines but. Because I can\u2019t make it at home, I can only eat it out.

But yeah, those are my favourite, I would think.<new>My favourite dish to cook would probably be  <unintelligible> , let\u2019s say than vegetarian than vegie lasagne. So, instead of the minced meat, in my family we use aubergine, courgettes, peppers. Mm, er, I make a  <unintelligible>  I make one in cheese sauce and like the tomato sauce and then we have like pasta sheets. So yeah, that would be my favourite meal to, probably, cook, that with garlic bread. But, obviously, if I\u2019m at uni, I\u2019d be doing, because I don\u2019t eat beef either, I would mix that up with, erm, turkey mince, which is a really, or lamb mince, which is a really good alternative. Apart from that, I would probably also say tacos. Tacos are my favourite to make but instead of, obviously, using beef, like I only, erm, would use black beans. So like, erm, that\u2019s really nice. And then we make our own guacamole and it\u2019s like with, ah, I love that too. Yeah, those are like my two favourite things to make.<new>Okay, yeah, sure. So, with the lasagne, I\u2019d say the lasagne\u2019s definitely the more complicated one, we start off by so, you obviously chop your aubergines, courgettes, peppers, chop them all, may, preferably into slices. And then we roast but whilst we roast, we add like our oil. So, I use chilli oil just because I like mine spicy. And yeah, so we roast. We have like a sort of grill thing so we let it roast for quite some time till all the vegetables like shrink. So, it\u2019s like aubergine goes like a really browny colour. But yeah, so we do that. I add on seasoning so salt, pepper, chilli powder. We add turmeric, erm, cumin. Oh gosh, what else do we add? Yeah, just th-those are the standard spices is what we add. Leave that to the side but like still ha-, keep it on low heat. And then we make the cheese sauce, which would be  <unintelligible> . Okay, so it\u2019s m-, butter and milk first, let it come to a simmer. Then add your two tablespoons of flour and then add, wait till it comes to a boi-, erm, comes to a boil? Yeah, so, when it starts bubbling, then you add all your cheese and I use like two hundred to three hundred grams of cheese just bec-, I like, er, I have this weird obsession with cheese. And, erm, yeah, so  <unintelligible>  that all in, you\u2019ve made your cheese sauce. Now, for the tomato sauce, we use tomato paste. We use a little bit of yoghurt, which isn\u2019t usually done in lasagne anyways but my family just like it like that. So, it\u2019s, erm, tomato paste and then also tinned tomatoes together. We add our seasonings into that as well, mostly chilli powder. We also use taco seasoning,  like the yea-, seasoning in our, erm, tomato sauce. I don\u2019t know why we do that. Then we add like a few, mm, diced peppers and stuff just to add some texture into the sauce. And then lastly, we have like the lasagne sheets. So, we don\u2019t make our own. I\u2019ve been trying to convince my family to buy a pasta machine but these guys don\u2019t want to listen to me. So, so, we get the ones where, erm, they\u2019re quite dry at first but you\u2019re meant to just put them into the baking tray but we don\u2019t do that. We, like a large bowl, fill that up with boiling water, let the pasta sheets soak in there until they\u2019re kind of soggy. But you\u2019re not mea-, you\u2019re not meant to do that but we do it anyway just because we\u2019re re-really scared that it\u2019s not going to cook. So then, each layer, so we put the, soak the pasta sheets, probably use a fork to like keep it dunked under the water, otherwise it sinks above. And then we have this huge lasagne like plate, I guess, and then we layer it. So, it goes pasta sheets, vegetables, tomato sauce, cheese sauce, another layer of pasta sheets and then we keep going in that consecutive order. And then at the top, we just add the cheese sauce all over it. Then the tomato goes on top. So, we do it in a different order. And then we just put a lot of like grated cheddar cheese on top. And then leave it in the oven for thirty to forty minutes until the top\u2019s all brown, take it out. By then the oven\u2019s hot so we use ready-made garlic bread and leave that in the oven for like eight to ten minutes and then by then, that\u2019s our meal completely done.", "Dear <addr5_IN_SN>, <nl><nl>This email is in regards to the languages part of my course.

{"id": "61259783-85fe-451a-a923-92be9bb0bfbb01504", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>What is religion? Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961). This definition further criticizes religion as something which individuals turn to out of worry and desperation.<nl>In addition to the functional definitions of religion which can be seen above, there is also the substantive definition of religion which can be investigated. Substantive definitions tend to define religion in terms of its content rather than its function. Here, it is common for the existence of a \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018supernatural being\u2019 to be present when defining religion. This can be seen in Roland Robertsons definition of religion, where he states that \u2018religion refers to the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life\u2019 (Robertson, 1970). Such definitions however, can be seen as problematic to the wider community. This definition of religion by Robertson, clearly necessitates the existence of a god, and rejects any ideas that do not have a \u2018god\u2019 at the centre of their ideology to be classed as religion. This would not allow for beliefs such as Buddhism to be categorised as a religion, due to the fact that it is not based upon the concept of a creator- God (Gethin, 1998). Robertson\u2019s view on religion is supported by Max Weber, who also uses a substantive concept of religion, seeing it as a belief in a divine entity which cannot be explained scientifically (Weber, 2009). In other words, the belief in a god is required for a concept to be deemed as a religion. Ronald Dworkin however, opposes this notion and states that \u2018religion, does not necessarily mean a belief in god\u2019 and \u2018religion is an interpretive concept\u2019 (Dworkin, 2013). Dworkins use of the word \u2018interpretive\u2019, infers that religion can have a different meaning, dependent on the individual. Buddhism has now been linked to the global category of a world religion (McMahan, 2012), causing much debate upon what constitutes religion. This begs the question, who has set the requirements for what can and cannot be defined as a religion? Who has the right to dictate this? As Aldridge states \u2018Defining religion involves an exercise of power\u2019 (Aldridge, 2007).<nl><nl>Religion in International Relations- Post Secularization and Foreign Policy <nl>Often, when analysing religion within the international relations scene it can be deemed an aspect which is hastily overlooked. Religion is rarely included in most major theories of international relations and this can be ascribed to major Western social thinkers rejecting the notion of religion (Fox and Sandler, 2004), as discussed previously. As a particular scholar illustrated , \u2018the role of religion in explaining attitudes toward issues of international relations is somewhat limited\u2019 (Jelen, 1994). However, when further analysing international relations and conflict, it is clear that religion can be seen as a crucial element which should not be disregarded. It has been said that \u2018Domestic conflicts, including religious conflicts are becoming increasingly international issues\u2019 (Fox and Sandler, 2004). This extract from \u2018Bringing religion into International Relations\u2019, further emphasis the vital role that religion can play when assessing international relations. Examples of conflict which involve religion are The Israel Palestine conflict and the Thirty Years war. Here, religion can be key in resolving and understanding the clash, possibly presenting a recourse. <nl>Post secularization, it has been noted that a global resurgence of religion is transforming our understanding of international relations (Thomas, 2005). As there has been an increase in religious actors, it has recently become a vital analytical focus (Haynes,2005). These religious actors can include examples such as foreign policy taking into account religion, as well as transnational factors. The more that religion begins to play a pivotal role in making country decisions, the more clarity there is on what a substantial role religion plays on the international scene. There has previously been a narrative which has pushed the notion that the term \u2018religion\u2019 carries negative connotations and only leads to tension and ferocity, bringing nothing of substance to the international relations division. This adheres to the \u2018Westphalian presumption\u2019, which holds that \u2018religious and cultural pluralism cannot be accommodated in international public life\u2019 (Thomas, 2005). In other words, faith must be conceived as an internal matter to the sovereign state in order to avoid the risk of potential religious wars. This has encouraged using scientific knowledge and clear reasoning as justification for decisions over religion. It is clear that during these strongly secular times, there wasn\u2019t a want to define the term \u2018religion\u2019 from an international perspective. However, as religion began to make a return to the international scene, events such as 911 and Samuel Huntingtons\u2019 famous \u2018The clash of civilizations?\u2019 thesis (Huntington, 2000), only drew more attention to the importance of religion on the international relations front. As there was deemed to be a rise in religious clash and issues, with pivotal events such as 911, the topic of religion had to be assessed on the international scale. <nl>Many would also agree that religion has an important role to play in creating and shaping beliefs, which may in turn influence the formulation of state policy and foreign policy considerations. An instance of this can be seen with President George W. Bush, where he referred to the US having a \u2018calling\u2019 and \u2018mission\u2019 by the \u2018Maker of heaven\u2019 in his speeches on Foreign Policy (Judis, 2005). Not only can it be inferred here that George Bush is attempting to appeal to his majority audience with his \u2018faithful\u2019 language, but his references to God here explain how religion has had a direct impact on the foreign policy choices made. Bush\u2019s choice of language and rhetoric is extremely influential in shaping perspectives of the US citizens opinions on foreign policy. It was found here that there was a clear link between religion and opinion on U.S foreign policy in the Middle East (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). In particular, Evangelical Christians are more supportive of Bush\u2019s Foreign policy on the Iraq war and his foreign policy in general (Pew Research Centre, 2020). In a specific study carried out by Pew Research Centre, even after adjusting for the identity of the respondents groups, the impact of Evangelical beliefs towards foreign policy towards the Middle East remained statistically important (Pew Research Centre, 2020). These results are significant as they provide confirmatory proof that the position of Evangelical affiliation in shaping public opinion on foreign policy is important. It is also fundamental in understanding what a large effect a single religious group can have on how a country is run. The Middle East and President George Bush are a great area of focus due to the Iraq war being a matter which has concerned wide-spread public opinion since 2003 (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). As Boyer stated \u2018For many believers in biblical prophecy, the Bush administration\u2019s go-it-alone foreign policy, hands-off attitude toward the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and proposed war on Iraq, are not simply actions in the national self-interest or an extension of the war on terrorism, but part of an unfolding divine plan\u2019 (Boyer, 2003). This quote highlights how it is recognised that many individuals feel as though these conflicts directly involve religion and god, not only country policy. This infers that individuals will use faith as a major indicator when deciding their stance on subjects such as the Iraq war and foreign policy. On the contrary, research from the Pew Research centre suggests that people feel as though their faith does not define their opinion on the Iraq War (Different Faiths, Different Messages, 2020). Either way, the fact that there is much debate around religion probes several questions on the topic of faith, making it a valid matter when discussing international relations. As religion is increasingly being used for justification as well as indication, it is an important matter to consider on the international scene. \u00a8<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, when looking at definitions of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the context of both Sociology and International relations, it is obvious that there is much debate around what the word entails and its specific effects on society, good or bad. It is clear however, that religion has played a large role in shaping and moulding the current societies that we live in today, as well as the international relations scene, be it secular or not. Although there may be much debate upon whether the consequences of religion are \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 and \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019, the simple fact that decisions have and are being made based upon this, make it a crucial element that must be taken into consideration when looking at both society and international relations. There is no doubt that further research in the field of religion is vital and needed in order for a wider understanding of religion and its impact in both contexts.", " Okay.

{"id": "f32789cc-22a4-463b-aff8-68fd83b3f81b08405", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl><nl>With the average person in the UK spending 110 minutes on social media, it is inevitable that content displayed across these platforms impact and influence societal norms. The nature of social media aids the ability for societal norms to not only be fueled and accepted across various cultures but also enable this to occur at an accelerated pace. However, the media has been proven to impact self-evaluation in a negative way. For example, there are numerous studies looking at women\u2019s self-evaluation, comparing weight-esteem based on neutral images or ideal images (Brown, Novick, Lord, &amp; Richards, 1992); self-worth based on social comparison (Jones &amp; Buckingham, 2005) etc. Unfortunately, looking at the effects on self-worth in men is minimal. This may be due to the rhetoric that portrays men as emotionless and when any type of emotion is displayed, idioms and phrases like \u2018be a man\u2019 or \u2018stop being a baby\u2019 comes into play. Due to this societal norm, it may make it difficult for men to be able to find appropriate support online and on social media platforms when struggling with the negative impact these sites can have on self worth. It is more acceptable for women to seek help online however, there is less support for men. By researching further into the impacts social media has on men\u2019s self worth, it can enable men to feel more comfortable when facing these issues. The research can aid understanding of this and also result in this topic becoming less taboo, giving a better chance for men to talk freely about their experiences.<nl><nl>I have investigated men\u2019s self worth in the context of social media and my main research question is \u2018How do young men talk about self worth within the context of social media (18-25)?\u2019. My method of analysis is discourse analysis as it allows for in-depth analysis into not only my participant\u2019s language use to construct ideas but also intonation. The interview will take place over a \u2018Zoom\u2019 video call, therefore I am able to have a video recording of all my participants' answers. <nl><nl>AnalysisResults<nl><nl>Through annotating my transcript I was able to select prominent themes that were discussed by my participant in the interview. These themes are spoken of throughout the interview and appear multiple times, even in different questions. From my initial question (line 7) I was able to determine that my participant is an avid user of social media, using it for entertainment purposes as well as using various platforms. This ensures that the questions I ask are relevant to my participant and the answers reflect their social media usage. <nl><nl>Key themes that were discussed by my participant include \"the ideal man\", involving image, appearance and social status; also \"alternate reality\", discussing not only the falseness of social media but also the construction of one's image on social media platforms.<nl><nl>The Ideal Man<nl><nl>The idea of \u2018the ideal man\u2019 featured within my participants answers multiple times, with a construction of what they personally believe to be the ideal man. As opposed to referring to what my participant feels they should look like, my participant instead suggests what others \"should be looking for\" (line 174) in a man, for example, the ideal height \"6 foot 4, or over 6 foot\" (line 175),  the ideal body, having \"six packs\" (line 138), adequate facial hair \"beard\" (line 176) etc. This is a very specific portrayal of men, suggesting that this is a common image for men to hold and strive to achieve. Although men do have an idea of what the ideal body type is they are also aware that in general life, this may not always be the case, with my participant stating that \"It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of me. It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of anyone I know.\" (line 162-163) when asked if he felt represented by men on social media. However, despite this acknowledgement, my participant still felt uncomfortable for comparisons between the appearance of men on social media and himself. My participant used the phrase \"I\u2019d prefer just to leave it at that\" (lines 161 and 294) indicating that men do feel uncomfortable about discussing their appearance, which supports the taboo of men expressing self-doubt and lacking self worth and lowered confidence. This would explain why my participant referred to other people he knows whenever talking about personal appearance, in order to make his answer generalised as opposed to solely him as well as deflect the discomfort about the fact that he is not the ideal man by justifying it with the fact that most people do not look like that. This is supported when he says \"I don\u2019t think many men would want to admit, especially among their peers, wouldn\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re not the ideal person.\" (lines 354-355) <nl><nl>In addition to the body image, a man\u2019s social status and financial status also seems to be prevalent when it comes to describing the \u2018ideal man\u2019 with my participant referring to men with \"seven figures\" (line 138), and men who have \"lavish\" (line 81 ) lifestyles. A given example was the actor and influencer \u2018Dan Bilzerian\u2019; well known for \"constantly flaunting a bunch of money\" (line 241) and \"constantly surrounded by money\". (line 242) This was someone who my participant would refer to as a \u2018role model\u2019 for most males. My participant also referred to the fact that \"men can be successful on social media without looking the greatest\" (line 225), due to their social and financial status. This is supported by the evolutionary psychology theory that women will desire men who are able to provide stability, in the forms of shelter, money, food etc. (Li, Li, Chan &amp; Zhang, 2016). This would explain that now in the digital age, men are able to attract attention with their wealth via social media through posting \"lavish\" (line 81) objects. As it is now commonplace for influencers to be posting this type of content, as my participant stated, \"ordinary people might look at that and think \u2018Well, that\u2019s not me\u2019.\"(line  So this becomes the new goals and the new norm. It is evident that the fact that my participant did not relate to these standards, as when asked if he felt represented by these role models and depictions of men he stated \"No. No. No. No I don\u2019t.\" (line 156) Being unable to relate to the norm often results in incongruence between one's actual self and ideal self which may lower self worth. (Rogers, 1959).<nl><nl>My participant states that they have changed themselves in order to conform with these standards, however wished not to elaborate on how he changed. Instead he referred to people that he knew of, talking about there being  \"a lot of men that will spend a bunch of time at the gym to try and achieve the body that every man wants.\" (lines 347-348) This emphasises that the pressures displayed online and on social media affects men enough for them to wish to change their lifestyle in order to relate to these standards. <nl><nl>Alternate Reality<nl><nl>Throughout my participants answers he refers to the fact that social media is \"not a true depiction\" (line 60) , is a \"very, very fake place\" (lines 104, 71, 63), \"is quite a negative place\" (lines 70, 84) , is \"not real\" (line 107) , is \"very unhealthy\" (line 117), has \"bad sides\" (line 123), is \"the furthest thing from real life\" (lines 147-148) etc. This is common in all the answers, and is said in multiple different ways. My participant referred to social media in very negative ways, and suggested it is a \"toxic\" (line 136) place, despite spending around \"5 hours\" (line 15) per day. This is not an uncommon amount of time on social media, however spending this much time surrounded by something that is perceived as negative by my participant, it is unsurprising that his self confidence is impacted. Also, despite this awareness of the fact that not everything is quite what it seems on social media, the standards are still internalised. This suggests that regardless of the reality or the accuracy of the things that one may be exposed to, they are still accepted by people and becomes the societal norm. My participant also refers to the fact that women are more educated about the ways images are distorted online as opposed to enhancements and photoshop for men.  <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl><nl>From my research, it is evident that despite being aware of the falseness and unrealistic standards of social media, it is evident that young men\u2019s self worth is impacted negatively by the content they are exposed to on social media. Despite being adamant that they are aware of the one sidedness of social media, men continue to make comparisons and draw from this to bring into real life situations. This makes it clear that men experience lowered self confidence not only looks wise but also based on their financial status, social status and more materialistic things. My research has also made it clear that men also feel pressure, and more should be done in terms of support for men online. However, regardless of the gender, social media does tend to display only positive events, making it harder for regular people to accept other events and negative things in real life.", "Erm, my favourite restaurant is, probably,  <restaurant1> \u2019s, just because it\u2019s like, it\u2019s not too expensive and the food, like the food never, I feel like I\u2019ve never had a bad  <restaurant1> \u2019s.

Due to contralateral processing, P3 should remain inattentive when shown a stimuli on the left. By using EEG, alpha activity can be recorded when shown a stimuli cued left or cued right. Event markers allow for it to be clear when the participant is shown the stimuli, and the alpha activity was recorded. The results showed that there was a significantly higher in left than right cue condition, and supported the hypothesis.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha activity refers to electrical impulses oscillating at 8-13Hz , this is an alpha wave. These brain waves begin in the cerebral cortex (Moini &amp; Piran, 2020) and occur during periods of inattention, where one is in a restful state, whilst being awake, examples of this is when closing eyes, meditating (Lagopoulos et al., 2009), daydreaming etc.  When the brain begins to focus on stimuli, alpha waves are suppressed. The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007), proposes that high alpha indicates disengagement and inhibition of task irrelevant brain areas. In task relevant brain areas, alpha remains low, supporting that alpha activity is modulated by attention.  <nl><nl>This hypothesis is supported by Magosso et al, 2019, which used a regular setting and a VR (virtual reality) setting to see if the intensity of the task and the levels of attention required affects alpha frequency. The results showed that alpha signals are suppressed when having to give attention to tasks although it seems that when isolated from all external features (when participating in VR) alpha activity becomes greater. This suggests that it is the modulation and diversion of attention which causes changes in alpha frequencies.<nl><nl>Sauseng et al (2005) presented participants with directional cues indicating which hemifield the target stimuli would appear in. The target stimuli consisted of either small or large bars which participants identified and responded with \u2018s\u2019 for small and \u2018l\u2019 for large. Results showed that there was stronger alpha frequency suppression in brain areas contralateral to the targeted hemifield. This is due to visual stimuli being processed contralaterally. 200ms before the stimuli was presented, in active processing areas like the parietal lobe (P3), the alpha range is also lower. This study is supportive of AIM (Klimesch et al, 2007), and is used as the basis for this experiment, as it is a partial replication. In this experiment, the focus will be on the effect of arrow cues, specifically the direction they are facing.<nl><nl>Hypothesis<nl>As AIH states, alpha range activity is present in areas that are uninvolved in active processing and is suppressed in areas that actively process. By directing attention, and cueing the participant to expect the stimuli in a specific region they will begin paying attention. As shown by Sauseng et al (2005), visual stimuli is processed contralaterally resulting in alpha suppression in the other side of the brain. For example, if the stimuli is present in the left visual field it will be processed by the right hemisphere. By using the left parietal cortex (P3) to record alpha activity, it is expected that alpha activity will be greater when a stimulus is shown on the left and for this activity to be suppressed when the stimuli is on the right.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 undergraduate students were participants chosen from an opportunity sample.<nl><nl>Design<nl>This experiment uses a within subjects design. The dependent variable is the alpha range amplitudes (microvolts) on the left hand side of the parietal lobe (P3). The independent variable is the direction of the arrow cue, with two levels, left or right. <nl>Materials<nl>This experiment used a Biopac MP36 to collect data, EEG electrodes, AC Cream, Abrasive paste, PsychoPy to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device and stimuli (see figure 1). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG by opening the Biopac student lab. From the \u2018analog\u2019 tab select Electroencaphagram (EEG)\u2019 \u20180.5-100Hz wnotch\u2019, so the 50Hz band is filtered out. Digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker.. The \u2018calculation\u2019 tab allowed alpha frequency to be recorded. Then select \u2018EEG alpha 8-13Hz\u2019 from the drop down list. The sampling rate was 1000Hz. The participant was then prepared to be attached to the EEG. The electrode sites were abraded with everi cream using a cotton bud, and then AC cream was put on the electrodes. The electrodes are placed using the 1020 system. The active electrode was placed on P3. Participants were then given a cued visual task. A fixation cross was cued at the centre of the screen for 34ms, followed by an arrow indicating where to focus attention, with a 50% chance of it being cued left or right. There was then an interval of 600-800ms followed by a fixation cross for the second time, finally the participant was shown the target stimuli for 50ms, either a large or small white bar against a black background. Participants were then asked to use the keyboard to respond to the stimuli, typing either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. 75% of the trials were valid (the target stimuli was presented in the same hemifield that the arrow cue indicated), and 25% were invalid (the target stimuli was presented in the other hemifield). There were 20 blocks of the four trial types (cue left with a small bar, cue right with a small bar, cue left with a large bar and cue right with a large bar) so in total there were 80 trials.<nl><nl>Results<nl>There were transformations applied to the raw 9-13Hz alpha EEG data. There were eventmarkers received by PsychoPy through the Stimtracker, in order to identify when the stimuli was presented to the participants. The data also was used to specifically analyse from 200ms prior to stimulus onset after the directional arrow cues had been shown. Furthermore, the data was rectified, making negative values positive despite them showing excitatory or inhibitory activity. The samples were also averaged in order to limit the impact that outlying values would have on the data. This data is referred to as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl><nl>Descriptive Statistics<nl><table><nl><nl>Inferential Statistics <nl>The wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T=566, n=38, p=.002).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results of this experiment show that there was a significantly higher level of alpha activity when the stimulus was shown on the left hand side, this fit the original hypothesis. These results are consistent with AIH (Klimesch et al, 2007) as it shows that when participants are given a stimulus in their left hemifield, due to contralateral processing, this is processed by the right part of brain areas. As we were looking at P3, the left side of the parietal lobe, when shown a cue on the left it was processed on the right, meaning the left was task irrelevant and inattentive, resulting in higher alpha activity.<nl><nl>Methodological Problems<nl>Factors which may have confounded data include artefacts, which is when the EEG is contaminated by excess movement. When eye movements take place, the electrical activity could be recorded as brain activity. Eye movements could be blinking or horizontal eye movement, especially when having to look at either side of the screen. Blinking could also pose other issues such as the participant missing the cue. However, it does not seem to be too much of an issue and repetition and more trials would minimise the effects of this.<nl>Another issue could be the laboratory setting, as this could have an affect on brain activity. This is not a very normal situation for participants to be placed in so they may be uncomfortable or more alert as they know they are being studied. This could impact the EEG recordings as it is not a life-like situation so the results may not be generalisable to the whole population.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Overall, the data is valid despite minor methodological issues, which after replication can minimise the effect of individual differences, such as blinking and horizontal eye movement. The data also supports AIH and produced the expected results.", "Hi <addr2_FN>, <nl><nl>Thanks for your response.

And then I\u2019ll put in, erm, I put teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon of garam masala, a teaspoon of turmeric and then a teaspoon of paprika and let, then like just to taste, like if I feel like it\u2019s not going to be spicy enough, I\u2019ll put a bit of like red, like red chilli powder in, just to make it a bit more spicy. And then after that, erm, they normally like start sticking to the bottom of the pan so then I try and put some water in to keep it like\u2026 just stop it from burning. And then, erm, after that I\u2019ll put in some chopped tomatoes out of like a can and then that just makes sure it doesn\u2019t burn in it. I cook that for like normally like five minutes. And then after that, I\u2019ll put in some potatoes that I\u2019ve like peeled before and then I cook those until they\u2019re cooked about halfway. And those are like in a like a square shape, like I cut them in squares but like it just depends on how you want it. But yeah, erm, put that in. Then I cook them up until they\u2019re cooked about halfway, then I\u2019ll put in the cauliflower  <unintelligible> . The cauliflower is just cut into however big the pieces like we want to have, I guess. And then I just leave that to cook and then just stir it every so often so it doesn\u2019t stick to the bottom and burn. But, yeah, then it\u2019s all made in about like twenty minutes, half an hour  <unintelligible>  too, too bad.

Let me kn<new>Hi, <nl><nl>Is it possible to reschedule my slot as a family emergency has occurred and it means I\u2019m currently unavailable for the session. <nl><nl>Hope to hear from you soon. <nl><nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hi,<nl><nl>My name is <part_FN_SN> and I\u2019m one of the 3 tenants who currently live at <house_number> <road>, <city>, <postcode>. I'm writing this email on behalf of us all in regards to the maintenance of the house.<nl><nl>Firstly, the fridge has been a recurring problem. This is because from day one it has always been difficult to fully close it - partly due to the design of the cupboard door and the fact that the freezer isn\u2019t working properly and as a result the ice builds up and doesn\u2019t allow it to close. This further prevents the fridge from closing properly in addition to the cupboard design door. This ongoing issue has resulted in numerous amounts of food not being kept properly and the unfortunate throwing away of them. We are all experiencing hard times as we attempt to continue living with COVID19, therefore the continuous cycle of buying food and it going off due to a dysfucntional and ineffective fridge makes these times just that much harder.<nl><nl>A contractor was sent out once and the service he provided was not good enough as this is still a very important issue - if not the most important as it directly effects our health and safety.<nl><nl>Another issue in the kitchen is that one of the lower cabinet doors has come off. I believe the inside components have snapped and the repair will require new parts.<nl><nl>The last of the issues in the kitchen is the metal wall section behind the sink. The bottom part of it has opened and essentially began to peel off. This also needs to be fixed because if its allowed to continue peeling the wall behind it will start to get wet from the sink and cause further damage to the property.<nl><nl>In line with maintenance requests, it has also been brought to my attention that the top floor tenant is extremely unhappy with the mattress she is having to use as she says all she can feel is the springs within it. This causes severe joint and shoulder pain - again this is important as it has a direct impact on her health. If this could be replaced it would be most helpful, as we are timely paying tenants who don\u2019t believe this to be an unjust request.<nl><nl>I did contact the <business> property management mobile contact number ending 152, I was directed to report all maintenance issues through property file. However, we were not given access to this platform and so can\u2019t use it. I did reply and let the person know this but I received no reply to that message and the maintenance issues are still outstanding.<nl><nl>I look forward to what solutions you are able to offer and hope to hear from you soon.<nl><nl><part_FN_SN>"]}

Thai food or, I would say Thai food, Chinese or American soul. It literally depends on my mood. So, Thai food, red Thai curry, the spicier the better, whereas you can also have prawn toast. I think prawn toast is more of a Chinese sort of thing but that, I love Chinese cuisine as well, Singapore fried rice. And then you have American soul food. So, that\u2019s like the hefty like burgers where it\u2019s just, it looks dirty like you have the chicken, bacon, everything  <unintelligible>  and the mash and peas and then the milkshakes and the fries. So, oh, it makes me hungry now  <laugh> . But yeah, erm, that would, those\u2019d probably be my favourite cuisines but. Because I can\u2019t make it at home, I can only eat it out. So yeah, it\u2019s more finding the best places that do those cuisines and then experimenting. But yeah, those are my favourite, I would think.<new>My favourite dish to cook would probably be  <unintelligible> , let\u2019s say than vegetarian than vegie lasagne. So, instead of the minced meat, in my family we use aubergine, courgettes, peppers. Mm, er, I make a  <unintelligible>  I make one in cheese sauce and like the tomato sauce and then we have like pasta sheets. So yeah, that would be my favourite meal to, probably, cook, that with garlic bread. But, obviously, if I\u2019m at uni, I\u2019d be doing, because I don\u2019t eat beef either, I would mix that up with, erm, turkey mince, which is a really, or lamb mince, which is a really good alternative. Apart from that, I would probably also say tacos. Tacos are my favourite to make but instead of, obviously, using beef, like I only, erm, would use black beans. So like, erm, that\u2019s really nice. And then we make our own guacamole and it\u2019s like with, ah, I love that too. Yeah, those are like my two favourite things to make.<new>Okay, yeah, sure. So, with the lasagne, I\u2019d say the lasagne\u2019s definitely the more complicated one, we start off by so, you obviously chop your aubergines, courgettes, peppers, chop them all, may, preferably into slices. And then we roast but whilst we roast, we add like our oil. So, I use chilli oil just because I like mine spicy. And yeah, so we roast. We have like a sort of grill thing so we let it roast for quite some time till all the vegetables like shrink. So, it\u2019s like aubergine goes like a really browny colour. But yeah, so we do that. I add on seasoning so salt, pepper, chilli powder. We add turmeric, erm, cumin. Oh gosh, what else do we add? Yeah, just th-those are the standard spices is what we add. Leave that to the side but like still ha-, keep it on low heat. And then we make the cheese sauce, which would be  <unintelligible> . Okay, so it\u2019s m-, butter and milk first, let it come to a simmer. Then add your two tablespoons of flour and then add, wait till it comes to a boi-, erm, comes to a boil? Yeah, so, when it starts bubbling, then you add all your cheese and I use like two hundred to three hundred grams of cheese just bec-, I like, er, I have this weird obsession with cheese. And, erm, yeah, so  <unintelligible>  that all in, you\u2019ve made your cheese sauce. Now, for the tomato sauce, we use tomato paste. We use a little bit of yoghurt, which isn\u2019t usually done in lasagne anyways but my family just like it like that. So, it\u2019s, erm, tomato paste and then also tinned tomatoes together. We add our seasonings into that as well, mostly chilli powder. We also use taco seasoning,  like the yea-, seasoning in our, erm, tomato sauce. I don\u2019t know why we do that. Then we add like a few, mm, diced peppers and stuff just to add some texture into the sauce. And then lastly, we have like the lasagne sheets. So, we don\u2019t make our own. I\u2019ve been trying to convince my family to buy a pasta machine but these guys don\u2019t want to listen to me. So, so, we get the ones where, erm, they\u2019re quite dry at first but you\u2019re meant to just put them into the baking tray but we don\u2019t do that. We, like a large bowl, fill that up with boiling water, let the pasta sheets soak in there until they\u2019re kind of soggy. But you\u2019re not mea-, you\u2019re not meant to do that but we do it anyway just because we\u2019re re-really scared that it\u2019s not going to cook. So then, each layer, so we put the, soak the pasta sheets, probably use a fork to like keep it dunked under the water, otherwise it sinks above. And then we have this huge lasagne like plate, I guess, and then we layer it. So, it goes pasta sheets, vegetables, tomato sauce, cheese sauce, another layer of pasta sheets and then we keep going in that consecutive order. And then at the top, we just add the cheese sauce all over it. Then the tomato goes on top. So, we do it in a different order. And then we just put a lot of like grated cheddar cheese on top. And then leave it in the oven for thirty to forty minutes until the top\u2019s all brown, take it out. By then the oven\u2019s hot so we use ready-made garlic bread and leave that in the oven for like eight to ten minutes and then by then, that\u2019s our meal completely done.", "Dear Ms. <addr4_SN> and Ms. <addr5_SN>, <nl><nl>After careful consideration I have come to the conclusion that unfortunately I can no longer handle the workload of both my double honours (<course1> ) as well as working a part time job and <course2> at the same time.

It says that I have gotten 0100 when actually I received 70100, I was just enquiring if this does mean my score for this test will actually be 0 as I worked hard to understand these concepts and it feels like this has been a waste of my effort as I did not know that this would mean I would get 0.

So, I could wake up, go to the bathroom next door, brush my teeth and then come back, get a snack. So, that\u2019s just the start of the day as I'm just, you know, relaxing in my room. Then I\u2019ll go downstairs in about an hour or so, cook some breakfast so eggs, er, bread, beans, sausages and, you know, all the trimmings, bacon as well but I\u2019ve actually kind of reduced on that recently. So, then that\u2019s breakfast. And then usually, I\u2019d set off for the library so around, maybe, eleven, twelvish. And then, er, on the way to the library, I\u2019ll probably pick up a few things from  <supermarket1>  so, maybe, a meal deal and a few fruits and drinks and whatever. And then pretty much from midday till about five, maybe, I would have just had the meal deal and then I\u2019ll make my way home. And then when I get home, a cheeky little spaghetti bolognaise to start the night off. And then yeah, it just depends, really, when I sleep when I have my next meal but really and truly, it\u2019s probably another sort of snack, yeah. <new>In terms of, er, which one do I like the most or which one is most beneficial to me?<new>Oh.

I used to make eggs, the, the bread, the, warm up the beans, you know, I, I liked cooking breakfast.

Erm, I'm not really sure I have one but, mm, I\u2019ve recently got into, erm, Chinese food recently, recently. But erm, what\u2019s my favourite cuisine? I don\u2019t really have one, I\u2019ll just I like a mixture of things.<new>Erm, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just quite different and it\u2019s not the typical, erm, yeah, potatoes or steak or fries or whatever. It\u2019s just a different sort of, like a whole different country, different culture, different taste, different flavours. So, but, erm, something like dumplings, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have it on a normal day in your house. So, if I had that. And then yeah, you could go to the basic stuff like, er, egg fried rice or chicken fried rice, king prawn fried rice but, yeah, just different culture, I\u2019d say.<new>Oh, my favourite dish to cook. Erm, I mean, I can cook but I wouldn\u2019t say I'm the  <chef>  of the house  <laugh> . So, there\u2019s not much of a, a range to pick from. But erm, I would say, I can make my own roasts quite well, actually, er.<new>Yeah.<new><laugh> , okay. So, erm, it starts by getting your King Edward potatoes in. They usually have a bit of a red tint to them on the outside. So, then you just wash the potatoes, peel them, er, put a bit of salt, a bit of herbs on them, you know, cut them up, er, mix it all together. Then that\u2019s the potatoes done. And a trick my mum taught me is that you can boil the potatoes for a bit before you put them in the oven, which makes them all fluffy and actually cooks them quicker. So yeah, you season it all up and then I actually boil it. Then you put it into the oven and then that\u2019s the potatoes done. Then you get the sausages out of the pack, er, place it on a tray on the foil, put it inside the oven. Then the gravy, it\u2019s, it looks simple but it\u2019s actually kind of hard to make because if you get it too thick, like you\u2019re just eating slob. And if it\u2019s too thin, it\u2019s just water. So, you\u2019ve just got to, as you\u2019re pouring in the hot water, pour in the gra-, the granules at the same time and mix it consistently, otherwise, if you get lumps or it gets all thin, it\u2019s not really going to taste the best. So, whilst you\u2019re doing all of that, the ovens and the sausages are inside. So, erm, really and truly, when you\u2019re making the gravy, you\u2019re practically done. And then, obviously, you\u2019re boiling up all the carrots, the broccolis and then you plate up and you\u2019re done."]}

Yeah, I know, it was bad  <laugh> .<new>So, I think I would one hundred percent cut milk out of my diet. If I could find a dairy free alternative for cheese, I would.

I don\u2019t eat beef anyway, so that\u2019s not a problem, I just stick to chicken and fish and try and cut out dairy.

And then you put your, like you can slice your onions however you want them, like I normally like leaving them long but like some people like dicing them and stuff. Then, erm, that goes into the like hot oil and then you like, you normally brown them off, like it depends on how everybody likes to have your onions cooked, I guess. And then, erm, after that, I normally put in like ginger or garlic. Like you can have it fresh but like just out of ease, like you can buy these garlic and ginger cubes from like  <supermarket1> \u2019s and stuff and they\u2019re frozen and then you just chuck them in. And I find that way easier than just like spending time with like peeling garlic and ginger and like do all that stuff. So then, erm, yeah, I use the cubes. And then after that, I\u2019ll use chopped chillies, like normally, we have them like chopped already so then like you don\u2019t have to chop them at a reasonable time. And yeah, I put that in. And that\u2019s like a teaspoon of that. And then, erm, after that, I let that like cook for a little bit just so it\u2019s like done. And then I\u2019ll put in, erm, I put teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon of garam masala, a teaspoon of turmeric and then a teaspoon of paprika and let, then like just to taste, like if I feel like it\u2019s not going to be spicy enough, I\u2019ll put a bit of like red, like red chilli powder in, just to make it a bit more spicy. And then after that, erm, they normally like start sticking to the bottom of the pan so then I try and put some water in to keep it like\u2026 just stop it from burning. And then, erm, after that I\u2019ll put in some chopped tomatoes out of like a can and then that just makes sure it doesn\u2019t burn in it. I cook that for like normally like five minutes. And then after that, I\u2019ll put in some potatoes that I\u2019ve like peeled before and then I cook those until they\u2019re cooked about halfway. And those are like in a like a square shape, like I cut them in squares but like it just depends on how you want it. But yeah, erm, put that in. Then I cook them up until they\u2019re cooked about halfway, then I\u2019ll put in the cauliflower  <unintelligible> . The cauliflower is just cut into however big the pieces like we want to have, I guess. And then I just leave that to cook and then just stir it every so often so it doesn\u2019t stick to the bottom and burn.

And they\u2019re both, you know, quite smiling a bit, so, erm. She\u2019s also, the teacher\u2019s also rolled their sleeves up, and she\u2019s got a black hairband on her right wrist, and she\u2019s let her blonde hair down. And erm, the student is sitting in the chair with her braids, and she\u2019s smiling quite a bit with her teeth showing as well. And erm, she\u2019s using her right hand to touch her chest, so I think they\u2019re just sharing a moment. So that\u2019s image one. And erm,  <misc>  in image two, there\u2019s a white background with a sort of uni, er, couch setup. And there\u2019s two males; er, one who\u2019s got a black earring in his left ear, and er, another who\u2019s also wearing a red, er, red shirt over a white, er, t-shirt. And they\u2019re both, er, sitting behind a Mac, and they\u2019re just looking at the computer. So I think they might be computing students or some type of technology involved in their, er, degrees also. Erm, the laptop\u2019s actually on a black sort of coffee table. And erm, yeah, it just looks like they\u2019re students on the same sort of course and, you know, just doing a bit of work together. So that\u2019s image two.

{"id": "2af014e8-0c02-4ffc-bace-27a559dddb2b03841", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["The Modern State is seen to have five key features: sovereignty, public institutions, territorial association, legitimation and domination (D\u2019Amato, 2018). These characteristics can be highlighted as territory (an area with defined borders), external and internal sovereignty where a state must be able to defend its territory and not be too dependent on another power. A state achieves sovereignty when it is recognised by the family of states as the \u2018sole governing authority within its territory and as the legal equal of other states\u2019 (The Modern State, 2020). Furthermore, there has to be legitimacy in which there is recognised rule, examples of this are traditional legitimacy, charismatic legitimacy and rational-legal legitimacy; the legitimacy enhances a state\u2019s sovereignty at a lower cost. The last characteristic is modern bureaucracy, this is required to generate as well as collect revenue. In this essay we will be discussing and critically examining Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, who criticizes the moralistic view of authority. Machiavelli although seen as an evil man, had a large influence on the future of modern civilisation especially in comparison to the artists of his time. <nl><nl>For Machiavelli, moral basis on which to judge the difference between illegitimate and legitimate uses of power does not exist, arguing that this does not add to the actual possession of power \u2013 rather the legitimacy rests upon the threat of coercive force. His beliefs rest in those that the leaders should avoid the common values of justice and mercy in preference to the use of violence and fear, particularly if it is in the best interest such as through gaining and expanding political power. Historians have stated Machiavelli to be the \u2018teacher of evil\u2019 such as Leo Strauss (McShea, 1963). However, Machiavelli has been credited with formulating the \"modern concept of the state\", that is understood in the Weberian sense of a \u2018form of rule possessing a monopoly of coercive authority within a set territorial boundary\u2019 (Nederman, 2019). Machiavelli derived his views from the experience of the Caesura Borgia.  However, Machiavelli did contribute to the way we understand the modern state now as he proposed his own conception of the \"civil principality\" whilst subverting his previous medieval idea of state as regime (Sellers,2015). However, it should be noted that force is not the only weapon to rule the people so his argument can be seen as psychologically weak.<nl><nl>Machiavelli also states that principality can be seen to be governed by a single ruler and is helped by anointed ministers which is the case in many current states seen today. Machiavelli states that the idea of taking over depends on the character of region than the character of the prince, he has the strong belief that the citizens will recollect and fight for their liberty. Although we have grown out of medieval brutality, it can be argued that the modern-day equivalent of killing is to send rivals to jail or allow opponents to lose if there is indecisiveness. An example of this is Brexit, where the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was seen as indecisive and therefore could not gain enough votes in time for the referendum. Another way Machiavelli is modernised is through the idea that leaders will need to make severe decisions, such as through firing a member of the cabinet. An example of this is the Night of Long Knives in 1962 where Macmillan sacked a third of his cabinet. Nevertheless, Machiavelli ignored individualism and had one sided views of human nature which can be viewed as a critical flaw.<nl><nl>For Machiavelli, law is also impossible to follow without the required military as arms are a requirement in order for leaders to establish great frameworks. Although it can be criticised as we do not follow medieval combat, there are still some aspects which apply to the modern state, for instance the concept that an army from your own principality is most beneficial for defending yourself \u2013 and this concept is universally accepted. Machiavelli also made the point that there is conflict of interest which can be seen in the modern state also, for example through the leak of the Panama papers. What is also seen in the modern state is Machiavelli\u2019s view on auxiliary troops being faithful to someone else, for example through the rise of the Taliban, as although it was intended for the Taliban to fight the Soviet Union, they later turned and became the lead terrorist group. In Antonio Negri\u2019s view, Machiavelli belongs to a \u2018political alternative of modern thought grounded on a revolutionary version of constituent power\u2019 (Negri and Maurizia Boscagli, 2009). However, Quentin Skinner and J.G.A Pocock write that we should regard Machiavelli as part of the republican tradition, i.e. as part of the living legacy of Aristotelian philosophy (Roecklein, 2012). Nonetheless, Machiavelli was the first modern thinker to have thought of the State as an independent entity and not recognising any religious organisation exterior to it and The Prince has been a choice of several political leaders such as Louis XIV, Napoleon Bonaparte and Benito Mussolini. <nl><nl>The modern state was \u2018constituted by an abstraction from personal to impersonal rule\u2019 (Mansfield, 1983). With Machiavelli we encounter a challenge to the classical regime which is expressed in his use of stato (his stato is someone\u2019s to acquire), whereas for Aristotle\u2019s regime there is some ordering of the inhabitants of the city. The central theme of Machiavelli\u2019s political ideas is power with absolute state being the end. The state is viewed as superior to all associations and is sovereign as well as autonomous however he also stated that religion cannot influence politics and the church cannot control the state, which is not the case. <nl><nl>Comparing Machiavelli to other theorists allows for us to critically evaluate him further. Plato had the vision of every human being born into a division which was maintained and creating an arrangement for the state in the course of classism whereas Machiavelli proposed with the aim of sovereignty to support the nation in which the leader controls and protects its citizens. Machiavelli\u2019s concept of virt\u00fa highlights the utilitarian needs of the country. For Machiavelli virt\u00fa outweighs virtue in times of need whilst Plato believes a \u2018just ruler must behave the same at all times\u2019 however we have to consider they were writing in different eras, as Plato\u2019s philosophy is based on utopian principles and Machiavelli is viewed as a realist (Abrams, M, 2017). Aristotle divides government into two categories: good and bad with good forms fall aristocracy and under bad fall oligarchy. Aristotle wanted to help society achieve goodness through politics whereas on the other hand Machiavelli sought to achieve the maintenance of power and stability. They have differing views in terms of Aristotle claimed that if an entire state is made to fear their ruler, this would cause unhappiness however Machiavelli suggested that it is better to be feared than loved as it creates balance. However, they are on similar sides when it comes to liberation, as in the Prince it stated such ruler should not dictate the actions of others, but all together Machiavelli was seeking a practical type of politics whilst Aristotle took a rather idealistic approach (Tabone, 2020).  <nl><nl>Hobbes and Machiavelli have fascinating ideas on human nature impacting the state as the common theme is the usage of fear, meaning power needs to be acquired and maintained but we have to remember that Machiavelli\u2019s time period involved the peak of absolutism and hierarchies. Philosophers such a John Locke have directly opposing views on government. Locke\u2019s perception of revolt as a right gave people excessive power compared to the government, this did not exist during the time of Machiavelli. Locke believed in the idea of the government working for the people, however this is directly opposed to Machiavelli\u2019s thought that the ruler should do what it takes to remain in power (Chris Joseph, 2014). Machiavelli recommended that coercion should be used in order to govern whereas Locke favoured a social contract with the concept of dual accountability. Although Machiavelli\u2019s concept of coercion is flawed, he did recognise that rulers could not govern by this alone and advocated for the use of cunning and subterfuge, Locke\u2019s social contract did not contain an element of this. Machiavelli had a pessimistic view of individuals and believed human beings are fundamentally bad whereas Locke was more optimistic. In the modern state it follows Machiavelli\u2019s model more as the rulers in the modern state are comprised of the rich and powerful in society. Mill and Machiavelli also have the same solution to government in freedom of speech, they are both aware that people cannot have a hand in ruling itself. <nl><nl>Political leaders and their followers believed that Machiavellism was a disease infesting the politic body. He is still regarded with a negative reputation, but he still aids us to understand the modern state. Machiavelli promoted the central role of a citizen in preserving institutions which is reflected through the meaning of the Second Amendment in the U.S. Constitution (Bernard, 2009). Among modern believers of Machiavelli, there are Burmese generals such as Web Jiabao, the Former Premier of China and Lord Mandelson (Bernard, 2009). Machiavelli and Pareto agree in terms of this where they say egotism or selfishness as a natural property of the human species (Femia, 2013). According to Machiavellism though, the principle aim of prince is the unification as well as welfare of the state which showed reality of practical politics. He deduced that the internal unity and powerful government were the essential of any state by observing the affairs of the interstate rivalries. The sole aim of the prince is also to increase power in ways such as to be an expert in managing and organising a war- power is seen as the only reason of the state. <nl><nl>To conclude Machiavelli contributes to the \u2018comprehension of constituent power as a living force within social order\u2019 (Lucchese, 2016). He developed a revolutionary position, suggesting that political conflict is not a destabilising factor, but rather the grounding force of free republics. His concepts and ideas are often misunderstood as he displayed rare intellect to become a partisan in an age where absolute monarchy held control (Mathur, 1991). All together Machiavelli was the first thinker who justified secular state and the first advocate for autonomy for the state. He unfairly became associated with evil through his critical work written about The Prince, and although it did not get translated until almost a hundred years later the negative view about Machiavelli had already been established into Elizabethan England. All together he communicated priority to the state and put it above morality and religion as it is the highest form of social organisation and most essential to promote human welfare, and this is seen clearly in the modern state. Machiavelli\u2019s Prince dealt exclusively with the interests of a single person of power that focuses on only the leader\u2019s welfare in mind whereas the theories of Plato, Aristotle, Locke and Mill dealt with the welfare of society. However, in the modern state there Machiavelli did consider that the Prince needed to maintain good relations with the people which is what we observe. It can be agreed the way that Machiavelli talks about the state as Machiavelli was a realist.", "It would have to be good Thai food. Thai food or, I would say Thai food, Chinese or American soul. It literally depends on my mood. So, Thai food, red Thai curry, the spicier the better, whereas you can also have prawn toast. I think prawn toast is more of a Chinese sort of thing but that, I love Chinese cuisine as well, Singapore fried rice. And then you have American soul food. So, that\u2019s like the hefty like burgers where it\u2019s just, it looks dirty like you have the chicken, bacon, everything  <unintelligible>  and the mash and peas and then the milkshakes and the fries. So, oh, it makes me hungry now  <laugh> . But yeah, erm, that would, those\u2019d probably be my favourite cuisines but. Because I can\u2019t make it at home, I can only eat it out. So yeah, it\u2019s more finding the best places that do those cuisines and then experimenting. But yeah, those are my favourite, I would think.<new>My favourite dish to cook would probably be  <unintelligible> , let\u2019s say than vegetarian than vegie lasagne. So, instead of the minced meat, in my family we use aubergine, courgettes, peppers. Mm, er, I make a  <unintelligible>  I make one in cheese sauce and like the tomato sauce and then we have like pasta sheets. So yeah, that would be my favourite meal to, probably, cook, that with garlic bread. But, obviously, if I\u2019m at uni, I\u2019d be doing, because I don\u2019t eat beef either, I would mix that up with, erm, turkey mince, which is a really, or lamb mince, which is a really good alternative. Apart from that, I would probably also say tacos. Tacos are my favourite to make but instead of, obviously, using beef, like I only, erm, would use black beans. So like, erm, that\u2019s really nice. And then we make our own guacamole and it\u2019s like with, ah, I love that too. Yeah, those are like my two favourite things to make.<new>Okay, yeah, sure. So, with the lasagne, I\u2019d say the lasagne\u2019s definitely the more complicated one, we start off by so, you obviously chop your aubergines, courgettes, peppers, chop them all, may, preferably into slices. And then we roast but whilst we roast, we add like our oil. So, I use chilli oil just because I like mine spicy. And yeah, so we roast. We have like a sort of grill thing so we let it roast for quite some time till all the vegetables like shrink. So, it\u2019s like aubergine goes like a really browny colour. But yeah, so we do that. I add on seasoning so salt, pepper, chilli powder. We add turmeric, erm, cumin. Oh gosh, what else do we add? Yeah, just th-those are the standard spices is what we add. Leave that to the side but like still ha-, keep it on low heat. And then we make the cheese sauce, which would be  <unintelligible> . Okay, so it\u2019s m-, butter and milk first, let it come to a simmer. Then add your two tablespoons of flour and then add, wait till it comes to a boi-, erm, comes to a boil? Yeah, so, when it starts bubbling, then you add all your cheese and I use like two hundred to three hundred grams of cheese just bec-, I like, er, I have this weird obsession with cheese. And, erm, yeah, so  <unintelligible>  that all in, you\u2019ve made your cheese sauce. Now, for the tomato sauce, we use tomato paste. We use a little bit of yoghurt, which isn\u2019t usually done in lasagne anyways but my family just like it like that. So, it\u2019s, erm, tomato paste and then also tinned tomatoes together. We add our seasonings into that as well, mostly chilli powder. We also use taco seasoning,  like the yea-, seasoning in our, erm, tomato sauce. I don\u2019t know why we do that. Then we add like a few, mm, diced peppers and stuff just to add some texture into the sauce. And then lastly, we have like the lasagne sheets. So, we don\u2019t make our own. I\u2019ve been trying to convince my family to buy a pasta machine but these guys don\u2019t want to listen to me. So, so, we get the ones where, erm, they\u2019re quite dry at first but you\u2019re meant to just put them into the baking tray but we don\u2019t do that. We, like a large bowl, fill that up with boiling water, let the pasta sheets soak in there until they\u2019re kind of soggy. But you\u2019re not mea-, you\u2019re not meant to do that but we do it anyway just because we\u2019re re-really scared that it\u2019s not going to cook. So then, each layer, so we put the, soak the pasta sheets, probably use a fork to like keep it dunked under the water, otherwise it sinks above. And then we have this huge lasagne like plate, I guess, and then we layer it. So, it goes pasta sheets, vegetables, tomato sauce, cheese sauce, another layer of pasta sheets and then we keep going in that consecutive order. And then at the top, we just add the cheese sauce all over it. Then the tomato goes on top. So, we do it in a different order. And then we just put a lot of like grated cheddar cheese on top. And then leave it in the oven for thirty to forty minutes until the top\u2019s all brown, take it out. By then the oven\u2019s hot so we use ready-made garlic bread and leave that in the oven for like eight to ten minutes and then by then, that\u2019s our meal completely done."]}
{"id": "ddbd4566-dfc2-4e7a-b074-dc17f02b9d1b", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>What is religion? Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961). This definition further criticizes religion as something which individuals turn to out of worry and desperation.<nl>In addition to the functional definitions of religion which can be seen above, there is also the substantive definition of religion which can be investigated. Substantive definitions tend to define religion in terms of its content rather than its function. Here, it is common for the existence of a \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018supernatural being\u2019 to be present when defining religion. This can be seen in Roland Robertsons definition of religion, where he states that \u2018religion refers to the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life\u2019 (Robertson, 1970). Such definitions however, can be seen as problematic to the wider community. This definition of religion by Robertson, clearly necessitates the existence of a god, and rejects any ideas that do not have a \u2018god\u2019 at the centre of their ideology to be classed as religion. This would not allow for beliefs such as Buddhism to be categorised as a religion, due to the fact that it is not based upon the concept of a creator- God (Gethin, 1998). Robertson\u2019s view on religion is supported by Max Weber, who also uses a substantive concept of religion, seeing it as a belief in a divine entity which cannot be explained scientifically (Weber, 2009). In other words, the belief in a god is required for a concept to be deemed as a religion. Ronald Dworkin however, opposes this notion and states that \u2018religion, does not necessarily mean a belief in god\u2019 and \u2018religion is an interpretive concept\u2019 (Dworkin, 2013). Dworkins use of the word \u2018interpretive\u2019, infers that religion can have a different meaning, dependent on the individual. Buddhism has now been linked to the global category of a world religion (McMahan, 2012), causing much debate upon what constitutes religion. This begs the question, who has set the requirements for what can and cannot be defined as a religion? Who has the right to dictate this? As Aldridge states \u2018Defining religion involves an exercise of power\u2019 (Aldridge, 2007).<nl><nl>Religion in International Relations- Post Secularization and Foreign Policy <nl>Often, when analysing religion within the international relations scene it can be deemed an aspect which is hastily overlooked. Religion is rarely included in most major theories of international relations and this can be ascribed to major Western social thinkers rejecting the notion of religion (Fox and Sandler, 2004), as discussed previously. As a particular scholar illustrated , \u2018the role of religion in explaining attitudes toward issues of international relations is somewhat limited\u2019 (Jelen, 1994). However, when further analysing international relations and conflict, it is clear that religion can be seen as a crucial element which should not be disregarded. It has been said that \u2018Domestic conflicts, including religious conflicts are becoming increasingly international issues\u2019 (Fox and Sandler, 2004). This extract from \u2018Bringing religion into International Relations\u2019, further emphasis the vital role that religion can play when assessing international relations. Examples of conflict which involve religion are The Israel Palestine conflict and the Thirty Years war. Here, religion can be key in resolving and understanding the clash, possibly presenting a recourse. <nl>Post secularization, it has been noted that a global resurgence of religion is transforming our understanding of international relations (Thomas, 2005). As there has been an increase in religious actors, it has recently become a vital analytical focus (Haynes,2005). These religious actors can include examples such as foreign policy taking into account religion, as well as transnational factors. The more that religion begins to play a pivotal role in making country decisions, the more clarity there is on what a substantial role religion plays on the international scene. There has previously been a narrative which has pushed the notion that the term \u2018religion\u2019 carries negative connotations and only leads to tension and ferocity, bringing nothing of substance to the international relations division. This adheres to the \u2018Westphalian presumption\u2019, which holds that \u2018religious and cultural pluralism cannot be accommodated in international public life\u2019 (Thomas, 2005). In other words, faith must be conceived as an internal matter to the sovereign state in order to avoid the risk of potential religious wars. This has encouraged using scientific knowledge and clear reasoning as justification for decisions over religion. It is clear that during these strongly secular times, there wasn\u2019t a want to define the term \u2018religion\u2019 from an international perspective. However, as religion began to make a return to the international scene, events such as 911 and Samuel Huntingtons\u2019 famous \u2018The clash of civilizations?\u2019 thesis (Huntington, 2000), only drew more attention to the importance of religion on the international relations front. As there was deemed to be a rise in religious clash and issues, with pivotal events such as 911, the topic of religion had to be assessed on the international scale. <nl>Many would also agree that religion has an important role to play in creating and shaping beliefs, which may in turn influence the formulation of state policy and foreign policy considerations. An instance of this can be seen with President George W. Bush, where he referred to the US having a \u2018calling\u2019 and \u2018mission\u2019 by the \u2018Maker of heaven\u2019 in his speeches on Foreign Policy (Judis, 2005). Not only can it be inferred here that George Bush is attempting to appeal to his majority audience with his \u2018faithful\u2019 language, but his references to God here explain how religion has had a direct impact on the foreign policy choices made. Bush\u2019s choice of language and rhetoric is extremely influential in shaping perspectives of the US citizens opinions on foreign policy. It was found here that there was a clear link between religion and opinion on U.S foreign policy in the Middle East (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). In particular, Evangelical Christians are more supportive of Bush\u2019s Foreign policy on the Iraq war and his foreign policy in general (Pew Research Centre, 2020). In a specific study carried out by Pew Research Centre, even after adjusting for the identity of the respondents groups, the impact of Evangelical beliefs towards foreign policy towards the Middle East remained statistically important (Pew Research Centre, 2020). These results are significant as they provide confirmatory proof that the position of Evangelical affiliation in shaping public opinion on foreign policy is important. It is also fundamental in understanding what a large effect a single religious group can have on how a country is run. The Middle East and President George Bush are a great area of focus due to the Iraq war being a matter which has concerned wide-spread public opinion since 2003 (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). As Boyer stated \u2018For many believers in biblical prophecy, the Bush administration\u2019s go-it-alone foreign policy, hands-off attitude toward the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and proposed war on Iraq, are not simply actions in the national self-interest or an extension of the war on terrorism, but part of an unfolding divine plan\u2019 (Boyer, 2003). This quote highlights how it is recognised that many individuals feel as though these conflicts directly involve religion and god, not only country policy. This infers that individuals will use faith as a major indicator when deciding their stance on subjects such as the Iraq war and foreign policy. On the contrary, research from the Pew Research centre suggests that people feel as though their faith does not define their opinion on the Iraq War (Different Faiths, Different Messages, 2020). Either way, the fact that there is much debate around religion probes several questions on the topic of faith, making it a valid matter when discussing international relations. As religion is increasingly being used for justification as well as indication, it is an important matter to consider on the international scene. \u00a8<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, when looking at definitions of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the context of both Sociology and International relations, it is obvious that there is much debate around what the word entails and its specific effects on society, good or bad. It is clear however, that religion has played a large role in shaping and moulding the current societies that we live in today, as well as the international relations scene, be it secular or not. Although there may be much debate upon whether the consequences of religion are \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 and \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019, the simple fact that decisions have and are being made based upon this, make it a crucial element that must be taken into consideration when looking at both society and international relations. There is no doubt that further research in the field of religion is vital and needed in order for a wider understanding of religion and its impact in both contexts.", "For the most recent armpit I used google chrome. <nl><nl>My <system> just doesn\u2019t seem to work and I\u2019ve been trying to submit it and that\u2019s why I sent it as an attachment in an email to <group> as I\u2019ve no other way of submitting this very important work<nl><new><nl>Yh that\u2019s fine. <nl>What time you lot tryna meet up and where ? <new>Nah just meet up after<new>Yh that\u2019s fine <nl>Make a gc and add my number so I know exactly where to meet you<nl><nl><phone_number><new>Afternoon, <nl> <nl>My name is <part_FN_SN> and I live in <building> \u2013 Floor <floor_number>, Flat <house_number1>, Room <house_number2>.<nl>My booking Id is : <id_number><nl> <nl>I\u2019m sending this email to officially inform you of my cancellation of my tenancy.<nl> <nl>As this return of room goes against my original plans, would it be possible to keep my belongings in the room until the official return of room date : <DDth> <month> <YYYY>?<nl> <nl>Hope to hear from you soon. <nl> <nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hi <addr4_FN>,<nl> <nl>Sorry for sending it so late.<nl> <nl>If you could just read over it, edit it and add it onto the poster as you see fit.

{"id": "37da43b8-807c-4249-ade4-1f2015b54fcf02978", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["The Modern State is seen to have five key features: sovereignty, public institutions, territorial association, legitimation and domination (D\u2019Amato, 2018). These characteristics can be highlighted as territory (an area with defined borders), external and internal sovereignty where a state must be able to defend its territory and not be too dependent on another power. A state achieves sovereignty when it is recognised by the family of states as the \u2018sole governing authority within its territory and as the legal equal of other states\u2019 (The Modern State, 2020). Furthermore, there has to be legitimacy in which there is recognised rule, examples of this are traditional legitimacy, charismatic legitimacy and rational-legal legitimacy; the legitimacy enhances a state\u2019s sovereignty at a lower cost. The last characteristic is modern bureaucracy, this is required to generate as well as collect revenue. In this essay we will be discussing and critically examining Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, who criticizes the moralistic view of authority. Machiavelli although seen as an evil man, had a large influence on the future of modern civilisation especially in comparison to the artists of his time. <nl><nl>For Machiavelli, moral basis on which to judge the difference between illegitimate and legitimate uses of power does not exist, arguing that this does not add to the actual possession of power \u2013 rather the legitimacy rests upon the threat of coercive force. His beliefs rest in those that the leaders should avoid the common values of justice and mercy in preference to the use of violence and fear, particularly if it is in the best interest such as through gaining and expanding political power. Historians have stated Machiavelli to be the \u2018teacher of evil\u2019 such as Leo Strauss (McShea, 1963). However, Machiavelli has been credited with formulating the \"modern concept of the state\", that is understood in the Weberian sense of a \u2018form of rule possessing a monopoly of coercive authority within a set territorial boundary\u2019 (Nederman, 2019). Machiavelli derived his views from the experience of the Caesura Borgia.  However, Machiavelli did contribute to the way we understand the modern state now as he proposed his own conception of the \"civil principality\" whilst subverting his previous medieval idea of state as regime (Sellers,2015). However, it should be noted that force is not the only weapon to rule the people so his argument can be seen as psychologically weak.<nl><nl>Machiavelli also states that principality can be seen to be governed by a single ruler and is helped by anointed ministers which is the case in many current states seen today. Machiavelli states that the idea of taking over depends on the character of region than the character of the prince, he has the strong belief that the citizens will recollect and fight for their liberty. Although we have grown out of medieval brutality, it can be argued that the modern-day equivalent of killing is to send rivals to jail or allow opponents to lose if there is indecisiveness. An example of this is Brexit, where the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was seen as indecisive and therefore could not gain enough votes in time for the referendum. Another way Machiavelli is modernised is through the idea that leaders will need to make severe decisions, such as through firing a member of the cabinet. An example of this is the Night of Long Knives in 1962 where Macmillan sacked a third of his cabinet. Nevertheless, Machiavelli ignored individualism and had one sided views of human nature which can be viewed as a critical flaw.<nl><nl>For Machiavelli, law is also impossible to follow without the required military as arms are a requirement in order for leaders to establish great frameworks. Although it can be criticised as we do not follow medieval combat, there are still some aspects which apply to the modern state, for instance the concept that an army from your own principality is most beneficial for defending yourself \u2013 and this concept is universally accepted. Machiavelli also made the point that there is conflict of interest which can be seen in the modern state also, for example through the leak of the Panama papers. What is also seen in the modern state is Machiavelli\u2019s view on auxiliary troops being faithful to someone else, for example through the rise of the Taliban, as although it was intended for the Taliban to fight the Soviet Union, they later turned and became the lead terrorist group. In Antonio Negri\u2019s view, Machiavelli belongs to a \u2018political alternative of modern thought grounded on a revolutionary version of constituent power\u2019 (Negri and Maurizia Boscagli, 2009). However, Quentin Skinner and J.G.A Pocock write that we should regard Machiavelli as part of the republican tradition, i.e. as part of the living legacy of Aristotelian philosophy (Roecklein, 2012). Nonetheless, Machiavelli was the first modern thinker to have thought of the State as an independent entity and not recognising any religious organisation exterior to it and The Prince has been a choice of several political leaders such as Louis XIV, Napoleon Bonaparte and Benito Mussolini. <nl><nl>The modern state was \u2018constituted by an abstraction from personal to impersonal rule\u2019 (Mansfield, 1983). With Machiavelli we encounter a challenge to the classical regime which is expressed in his use of stato (his stato is someone\u2019s to acquire), whereas for Aristotle\u2019s regime there is some ordering of the inhabitants of the city. The central theme of Machiavelli\u2019s political ideas is power with absolute state being the end. The state is viewed as superior to all associations and is sovereign as well as autonomous however he also stated that religion cannot influence politics and the church cannot control the state, which is not the case. <nl><nl>Comparing Machiavelli to other theorists allows for us to critically evaluate him further. Plato had the vision of every human being born into a division which was maintained and creating an arrangement for the state in the course of classism whereas Machiavelli proposed with the aim of sovereignty to support the nation in which the leader controls and protects its citizens. Machiavelli\u2019s concept of virt\u00fa highlights the utilitarian needs of the country. For Machiavelli virt\u00fa outweighs virtue in times of need whilst Plato believes a \u2018just ruler must behave the same at all times\u2019 however we have to consider they were writing in different eras, as Plato\u2019s philosophy is based on utopian principles and Machiavelli is viewed as a realist (Abrams, M, 2017). Aristotle divides government into two categories: good and bad with good forms fall aristocracy and under bad fall oligarchy. Aristotle wanted to help society achieve goodness through politics whereas on the other hand Machiavelli sought to achieve the maintenance of power and stability. They have differing views in terms of Aristotle claimed that if an entire state is made to fear their ruler, this would cause unhappiness however Machiavelli suggested that it is better to be feared than loved as it creates balance. However, they are on similar sides when it comes to liberation, as in the Prince it stated such ruler should not dictate the actions of others, but all together Machiavelli was seeking a practical type of politics whilst Aristotle took a rather idealistic approach (Tabone, 2020).  <nl><nl>Hobbes and Machiavelli have fascinating ideas on human nature impacting the state as the common theme is the usage of fear, meaning power needs to be acquired and maintained but we have to remember that Machiavelli\u2019s time period involved the peak of absolutism and hierarchies. Philosophers such a John Locke have directly opposing views on government. Locke\u2019s perception of revolt as a right gave people excessive power compared to the government, this did not exist during the time of Machiavelli. Locke believed in the idea of the government working for the people, however this is directly opposed to Machiavelli\u2019s thought that the ruler should do what it takes to remain in power (Chris Joseph, 2014). Machiavelli recommended that coercion should be used in order to govern whereas Locke favoured a social contract with the concept of dual accountability. Although Machiavelli\u2019s concept of coercion is flawed, he did recognise that rulers could not govern by this alone and advocated for the use of cunning and subterfuge, Locke\u2019s social contract did not contain an element of this. Machiavelli had a pessimistic view of individuals and believed human beings are fundamentally bad whereas Locke was more optimistic. In the modern state it follows Machiavelli\u2019s model more as the rulers in the modern state are comprised of the rich and powerful in society. Mill and Machiavelli also have the same solution to government in freedom of speech, they are both aware that people cannot have a hand in ruling itself. <nl><nl>Political leaders and their followers believed that Machiavellism was a disease infesting the politic body. He is still regarded with a negative reputation, but he still aids us to understand the modern state. Machiavelli promoted the central role of a citizen in preserving institutions which is reflected through the meaning of the Second Amendment in the U.S. Constitution (Bernard, 2009). Among modern believers of Machiavelli, there are Burmese generals such as Web Jiabao, the Former Premier of China and Lord Mandelson (Bernard, 2009). Machiavelli and Pareto agree in terms of this where they say egotism or selfishness as a natural property of the human species (Femia, 2013). According to Machiavellism though, the principle aim of prince is the unification as well as welfare of the state which showed reality of practical politics. He deduced that the internal unity and powerful government were the essential of any state by observing the affairs of the interstate rivalries. The sole aim of the prince is also to increase power in ways such as to be an expert in managing and organising a war- power is seen as the only reason of the state. <nl><nl>To conclude Machiavelli contributes to the \u2018comprehension of constituent power as a living force within social order\u2019 (Lucchese, 2016). He developed a revolutionary position, suggesting that political conflict is not a destabilising factor, but rather the grounding force of free republics. His concepts and ideas are often misunderstood as he displayed rare intellect to become a partisan in an age where absolute monarchy held control (Mathur, 1991). All together Machiavelli was the first thinker who justified secular state and the first advocate for autonomy for the state. He unfairly became associated with evil through his critical work written about The Prince, and although it did not get translated until almost a hundred years later the negative view about Machiavelli had already been established into Elizabethan England. All together he communicated priority to the state and put it above morality and religion as it is the highest form of social organisation and most essential to promote human welfare, and this is seen clearly in the modern state. Machiavelli\u2019s Prince dealt exclusively with the interests of a single person of power that focuses on only the leader\u2019s welfare in mind whereas the theories of Plato, Aristotle, Locke and Mill dealt with the welfare of society. However, in the modern state there Machiavelli did consider that the Prince needed to maintain good relations with the people which is what we observe. It can be agreed the way that Machiavelli talks about the state as Machiavelli was a realist.", "Dear Ms. <addr4_SN> and Ms. <addr5_SN>, <nl><nl>After careful consideration I have come to the conclusion that unfortunately I can no longer handle the workload of both my double honours (<course1> ) as well as working a part time job and <course2> at the same time.

So number one consists of the lady in the denim jacket sitting down, she\u2019s staring at something and her mouth is wide open. She has quite a surprised, but in a positive way, erm, her facial feature shows that she is looking at something which is surprising. And the other lady, on the right of her, is looking downwards towards something. Erm, also the lady with the black and white stripey top has medium length hair, is quite fair skinned, has dark brown hair going into more of an ombr\u00e9 blonde. Whereas the other lady sat down is, she is a Black lady, with black twists. Also, by the picture, it looks like the lady in the black and white top is showing er, her friend next to her, they look like they know each other. And yeah, they look like they\u2019re friends. They look like they are s- in some sort of maybe school environment. It\u2019s a casual environment, which is seen by the clothes that they are wearing. Another way this picture can also be seen is the lady in the denim jacket is looking, n-not looking at something that the girl in the black and white top is showing her, she\u2019s actually looking at something else, and that she\u2019s surprised by what she\u2019s seen because her mouth is wide open.

One is of South Asian descent, has short black hair and is wearing a black and red chequered shirt with a white top underneath, and there\u2019s a boy next to him on the, his left. And he\u2019s quite fair skinned, has a black ear piercing, and has short brown hair. He\u2019s wearing a top which consists of black and white flowers with red writing on top, but you can\u2019t read the writing.

Whereas his friend next to him is either staring at him, or there is something that\u2019s distracted him that\u2019s next to the guy in the black and red sweatshirt. From the looks of it, because of how close they are, they look like friends. And they look like university students, or a little bit older. They, yeah, they look around the age of between eighteen to er twenty-two. Yeah. In the background actually there are light green and dark green spots, with a black background, which looks like either a wallpaper or it looks like they\u2019re sitting down on a sofa which has that background. And the table that the MacBook is on is a wooden table with different shades of brown, giving it that timber sort of effect. Yeah. In the third picture, there is a Black female and on her left is a South Asian male. South Asian male has a beard and almost a buzz cut which has grown out. And he is wearing a dark green shirt with a long black coat that has buttons on the side, and also a long collar with beige trousers, dark beige trousers, and he is wearing black trainers. In the background of these two people there is a sort of spiral, almost hypnotising effect, sort of wallpaper. Which is, consists of many small, round, white circles across a black backdrop. The girl is wearing a black top with a black leather jacket, and is holding something in her hand, which I can\u2019t see it. Oh, she\u2019s holding something and it looks like there is also a hand in the picture, next to both of her hands. She\u2019s also wearing dark maroon leggings, with light brown leather boots. There is a table in front of them which has something on the glass table, which consists of either leaflets or pamphlets. And yeah, the male is also holding a book which he\u2019s gone through about, I\u2019d say, fifty per cent of. He looks like he\u2019s in the middle of the book; he looks like he\u2019s about to turn a page. They both are staring at the same thing, it looks like, because their eyes are in the same direction. They are both smiling. Erm, you can tell they\u2019re both quite comfortable with each other because of how close they are sat to each other. It looks like they are almost friends. It also looks like they may be students as well, because that looks like quite a big book. So yeah, number three has, you can tell they\u2019re both looking at something which makes them happy, or is something that is amusing to them. Because neither of them look confused.

I wish I could go vegan. I, w-, I genuinely wish I had to the willpower. I think I did try once but there are just not many alternatives that taste the same as cheese. But when it comes to like dairy free chocolate and stuff like, we\u2019re trying. I know my sister\u2019s new year\u2019s resolution is to go vegan for the year. So, I\u2019m the only one my hou-, my dad and I are the only people in the household that eat meat. So, my mum and my sister\u2019s vegetarian. So, it just mean my whole life I have not eaten meat. So, I, I c-, I could go without eating meat in my whole life one hundred percent. It\u2019s just I think in terms of when I was younger, I didn\u2019t like the food that my mum gave me, if that makes sense.

I will scrutinize the works and theories of philosophers around the topic of liberalism over the years such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and John Stewart Mill.

Comparatively I will analyse how the concept of freedom is portrayed or even limited in the Quran. I will then investigate the theory of absolute freedom in liberalism through an Islamic perspective.

And then by the time it\u2019s time to eat it\u2019s like lunchtime, so I just eat something, like a wrap or I\u2019ll have, like if, if I feel like I want breakfast type food, then I\u2019ll eat a toast or some like sausages or hash browns or something. And, erm, then I\u2019ll have some like crisps or something and I\u2019ll normally by like three o\u2019clock or something, I want to have, I want to have some snacks. And then I try and eat something a bit healthier so then I don\u2019t feel as bad so I\u2019ll have, erm, like some grapes or strawberries or like whatever fruit we have lying around. And then, erm, yeah, then, I normally have some more water or I have some juice or something. And then in the evenings, erm, I tend to eat like Indian food, normally, so I\u2019ll have like chapatis or curry or something, rice. And then if not that, then I\u2019ll just find whatever\u2019s lying around, whatever\u2019s in the fridge in the kitchen. Erm, there\u2019s normally leftovers so like if we\u2019ve made some, like if we\u2019ve made a lot of food the night before, it\u2019s easier to eat the next day. And then, erm, yeah, I normally, in the evening, if I do eat anything sweet, then I f-, like, I feel like my teeth feel weird so then I like try and drink like lots of water before bed.

Let me kn<new>Hi, <nl><nl>Is it possible to reschedule my slot as a family emergency has occurred and it means I\u2019m currently unavailable for the session. <nl><nl>Hope to hear from you soon. <nl><nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hi,<nl><nl>My name is <part_FN_SN> and I\u2019m one of the 3 tenants who currently live at <house_number> <road>, <city>, <postcode>. I'm writing this email on behalf of us all in regards to the maintenance of the house.<nl><nl>Firstly, the fridge has been a recurring problem. This is because from day one it has always been difficult to fully close it - partly due to the design of the cupboard door and the fact that the freezer isn\u2019t working properly and as a result the ice builds up and doesn\u2019t allow it to close. This further prevents the fridge from closing properly in addition to the cupboard design door. This ongoing issue has resulted in numerous amounts of food not being kept properly and the unfortunate throwing away of them. We are all experiencing hard times as we attempt to continue living with COVID19, therefore the continuous cycle of buying food and it going off due to a dysfucntional and ineffective fridge makes these times just that much harder.<nl><nl>A contractor was sent out once and the service he provided was not good enough as this is still a very important issue - if not the most important as it directly effects our health and safety.<nl><nl>Another issue in the kitchen is that one of the lower cabinet doors has come off. I believe the inside components have snapped and the repair will require new parts.<nl><nl>The last of the issues in the kitchen is the metal wall section behind the sink. The bottom part of it has opened and essentially began to peel off. This also needs to be fixed because if its allowed to continue peeling the wall behind it will start to get wet from the sink and cause further damage to the property.<nl><nl>In line with maintenance requests, it has also been brought to my attention that the top floor tenant is extremely unhappy with the mattress she is having to use as she says all she can feel is the springs within it. This causes severe joint and shoulder pain - again this is important as it has a direct impact on her health. If this could be replaced it would be most helpful, as we are timely paying tenants who don\u2019t believe this to be an unjust request.<nl><nl>I did contact the <business> property management mobile contact number ending 152, I was directed to report all maintenance issues through property file. However, we were not given access to this platform and so can\u2019t use it. I did reply and let the person know this but I received no reply to that message and the maintenance issues are still outstanding.<nl><nl>I look forward to what solutions you are able to offer and hope to hear from you soon.<nl><nl><part_FN_SN>"]}

And it looks so disgusting whilst he\u2019s making it. But like the f-, end product, like it looks amazing and it looks like it tastes really good. And the thing is like, erm, like, I, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not vegan or I\u2019m not vegetarian or anything but my boyfriend is. So, like, I feel bad whenever I\u2019m like eating like a burger or like something like that near him. Like he doesn\u2019t mind but like at the same time, I feel like, I feel bad so then like I\u2019ve been trying to, you know, like not be vegetarian but trying to eat a bit more like vegetarian. 'Cause not only is it like good for the environment and stuff like, a lot of people around me are vegetarian, so like my parents are vegetarian, like my boyfriend\u2019s vegetarian now, my, like a lot of my friends have become vegetarian as well. So, I feel like it would help. But like, I feel like I like meat a lot so having that would be amazing. And being able to make it I feel like would be, would be cool but like it\u2019s so weird like it just looks, it looks so tasty but at like at the same time, like I don\u2019t know how like I would find it or how I\u2019d make it. So, I think that\u2019s something I really want to try.<new>Oh, that would, yeah, I think, I think I\u2019d eat a bit more... because at the moment, I feel like  <laugh> , especially like as a student like I have to watch like what I\u2019m spending money on and I feel like when I s-, try and save money, I try and save on food more than anything when, because with drink, like, especially when like you\u2019re like, like now stuff\u2019s opening up and stuff and like you want to spend money on drinks and stuff. So, I would prioritise that like before my food so like I will go like, I remember like, I, it doesn\u2019t happen as much now because I\u2019ve been at home quite a lot because of, erm, like just out of ease and\u2026 but like in my first year, I used to eat like noodles all the time and my friends would be like, \"Yeah, we\u2019re eating this, like we\u2019ve prepped these meals,\" and I\u2019d be like, \"Yeah, no, that\u2019s not happening.\" But I feel like I\u2019d be able to, I\u2019d eat out a lot more than I do now and I feel like... I don\u2019t feel like my, like my taste would change as much as it would just be like I\u2019d eat out really  <laugh>  more and like I\u2019d probably end up drinking way more or like not having to drink like, when it comes to like, I feel like with like normal like drinks and stuff like it\u2019s fine but like when it comes to alcohol, like I feel like I do try and like choose the cheapest option and I feel like it\u2019s so easy to just like, to find expensive drinks that you do end up liking. So, like, I\u2019d probably end up spending like too much money on drinking like, mm. But the thing is like the more expensive alcohol is, I feel like it tastes better or like, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just me or like if it actually is or if it\u2019s just like a placebo type thing where it\u2019s like, \"Oh, it\u2019s more expensive so it tastes better.\" But I don\u2019t know, I feel like I\u2019d spend a lot of money on going out and drinking.", "So in the image one there\u2019s er, two people. Er, one white female and another Black female. And I can just tell by the way the\u2026 okay, so the background is white as well, and the, the white female\u2019s standing up and almost bending over, and er, I can see it\u2019s a sort of teacher and student relationship. And they\u2019re both, you know, quite smiling a bit, so, erm. She\u2019s also, the teacher\u2019s also rolled their sleeves up, and she\u2019s got a black hairband on her right wrist, and she\u2019s let her blonde hair down. And erm, the student is sitting in the chair with her braids, and she\u2019s smiling quite a bit with her teeth showing as well. And erm, she\u2019s using her right hand to touch her chest, so I think they\u2019re just sharing a moment. So that\u2019s image one. And erm,  <misc>  in image two, there\u2019s a white background with a sort of uni, er, couch setup. And there\u2019s two males; er, one who\u2019s got a black earring in his left ear, and er, another who\u2019s also wearing a red, er, red shirt over a white, er, t-shirt. And they\u2019re both, er, sitting behind a Mac, and they\u2019re just looking at the computer. So I think they might be computing students or some type of technology involved in their, er, degrees also. Erm, the laptop\u2019s actually on a black sort of coffee table. And erm, yeah, it just looks like they\u2019re students on the same sort of course and, you know, just doing a bit of work together. So that\u2019s image two. And in image three, the background is almost a circle of white beads, o- placed on a black, er, background board. And it\u2019s got two, er, people in it. Er, one, er female and one male. Erm, she\u2019s wearing a leather black jacket and he\u2019s also g- holding a book. And I do believe there might be a third person in the picture but they\u2019re just out of the scene. So yeah, they\u2019re sitting on a, I think it\u2019s a red or sort of er, a rose type couch, and er, they\u2019ve got a glass coffee table in front of them. Er, the man\u2019s got a beard and, er, he\u2019s smiling quite a bit, with a green top under his black, er, inspector gadget jacket,  <laugh>  some people would say. Erm, he\u2019s wearing some, er, brown khaki trousers \u2013 no, brown trousers, yeah. And er, the lady\u2019s wearing some brown boots with red leggings, I would say. Erm, you can\u2019t really see it too caref- too well, but er, she\u2019s got some earrings I think, that are dangling. So er, yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it. So yeah, I would say they\u2019re, they\u2019re both students as well, because they\u2019ve got a book. And er, I don\u2019t know who the third character in the picture is as we can\u2019t really see, but we can just see one of his hands. But yeah. And there\u2019s a leaflet on the glass coffee table in front of them. And that\u2019s it for picture three."]}

Erm, my favourite restaurant, I would say, is  <restaurant1>  and my go to dish from there would be ebi katsu and, er, the chicken curry with the rice. So, the katsu\u2019s actually, literally just fried prawns. So, er, it\u2019s got a nice, a nice coating on the outside and on the inside, when you bit into it\u2019s quite flavourful. Then, er, the actual chicken curry is just rice underneath it all and it\u2019s covered by quite a few vegetables, a few sauces and the actual chicken, you know, mixed in a curry sauce.

So, it\u2019s like a doughy, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s a circle and it\u2019s like a doughy type thing so you can literally just, er, pick it up with your hands. And you eat it with a sort of, erm, soup. So, you literally put it in the middle of the bowl and then you pour the soup around it and usually, depending on the type of soup it is, it might have different meats or fishes. So, you could have a fish soup or a meat soup. I usually prefer the, the meat soups. So, erm, you could have a meat soup one with the  <dish1>  and er, yeah. And how you make it is that it\u2019s water mixed with the powder. So, it starts in a box and you just build the water up, pour the powder in and then just, you know, mix that together. And then the actual soup is a separate thing altogether. And depending on what type you\u2019re making, it can take quite a while because it\u2019s, you know, really advanced but,  <misc> . But, erm, yeah. I don\u2019t know how to make the soup  <laugh> .

I don\u2019t really have one, I\u2019ll just I like a mixture of things.<new>Erm, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just quite different and it\u2019s not the typical, erm, yeah, potatoes or steak or fries or whatever. It\u2019s just a different sort of, like a whole different country, different culture, different taste, different flavours. So, but, erm, something like dumplings, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have it on a normal day in your house. So, if I had that. And then yeah, you could go to the basic stuff like, er, egg fried rice or chicken fried rice, king prawn fried rice but, yeah, just different culture, I\u2019d say.<new>Oh, my favourite dish to cook. Erm, I mean, I can cook but I wouldn\u2019t say I'm the  <chef>  of the house  <laugh> . So, there\u2019s not much of a, a range to pick from. But erm, I would say, I can make my own roasts quite well, actually, er.<new>Yeah.<new><laugh> , okay. So, erm, it starts by getting your King Edward potatoes in. They usually have a bit of a red tint to them on the outside. So, then you just wash the potatoes, peel them, er, put a bit of salt, a bit of herbs on them, you know, cut them up, er, mix it all together. Then that\u2019s the potatoes done. And a trick my mum taught me is that you can boil the potatoes for a bit before you put them in the oven, which makes them all fluffy and actually cooks them quicker. So yeah, you season it all up and then I actually boil it. Then you put it into the oven and then that\u2019s the potatoes done. Then you get the sausages out of the pack, er, place it on a tray on the foil, put it inside the oven. Then the gravy, it\u2019s, it looks simple but it\u2019s actually kind of hard to make because if you get it too thick, like you\u2019re just eating slob. And if it\u2019s too thin, it\u2019s just water. So, you\u2019ve just got to, as you\u2019re pouring in the hot water, pour in the gra-, the granules at the same time and mix it consistently, otherwise, if you get lumps or it gets all thin, it\u2019s not really going to taste the best. So, whilst you\u2019re doing all of that, the ovens and the sausages are inside. So, erm, really and truly, when you\u2019re making the gravy, you\u2019re practically done. And then, obviously, you\u2019re boiling up all the carrots, the broccolis and then you plate up and you\u2019re done."]}

Erm, I'm not really sure I have one but, mm, I\u2019ve recently got into, erm, Chinese food recently, recently. But erm, what\u2019s my favourite cuisine? I don\u2019t really have one, I\u2019ll just I like a mixture of things.<new>Erm, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just quite different and it\u2019s not the typical, erm, yeah, potatoes or steak or fries or whatever. It\u2019s just a different sort of, like a whole different country, different culture, different taste, different flavours. So, but, erm, something like dumplings, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have it on a normal day in your house. So, if I had that. And then yeah, you could go to the basic stuff like, er, egg fried rice or chicken fried rice, king prawn fried rice but, yeah, just different culture, I\u2019d say.<new>Oh, my favourite dish to cook. Erm, I mean, I can cook but I wouldn\u2019t say I'm the  <chef>  of the house  <laugh> . So, there\u2019s not much of a, a range to pick from. But erm, I would say, I can make my own roasts quite well, actually, er.<new>Yeah.<new><laugh> , okay. So, erm, it starts by getting your King Edward potatoes in. They usually have a bit of a red tint to them on the outside. So, then you just wash the potatoes, peel them, er, put a bit of salt, a bit of herbs on them, you know, cut them up, er, mix it all together. Then that\u2019s the potatoes done. And a trick my mum taught me is that you can boil the potatoes for a bit before you put them in the oven, which makes them all fluffy and actually cooks them quicker. So yeah, you season it all up and then I actually boil it. Then you put it into the oven and then that\u2019s the potatoes done. Then you get the sausages out of the pack, er, place it on a tray on the foil, put it inside the oven. Then the gravy, it\u2019s, it looks simple but it\u2019s actually kind of hard to make because if you get it too thick, like you\u2019re just eating slob. And if it\u2019s too thin, it\u2019s just water. So, you\u2019ve just got to, as you\u2019re pouring in the hot water, pour in the gra-, the granules at the same time and mix it consistently, otherwise, if you get lumps or it gets all thin, it\u2019s not really going to taste the best. So, whilst you\u2019re doing all of that, the ovens and the sausages are inside. So, erm, really and truly, when you\u2019re making the gravy, you\u2019re practically done. And then, obviously, you\u2019re boiling up all the carrots, the broccolis and then you plate up and you\u2019re done."]}

But yeah, anything like that. If there\u2019s any, if it\u2019s around lunchtime, it would probably be something frozen so like frozen pizza or like frozen burgers.

So, it would either be, if it\u2019s Mexican, we\u2019ll have like loads of vegetables in a wrap, we have veg, veggie pasta. We eat dinner at around six to seven and then if any of us are hungry after, there\u2019s always like chocolate or snacks or food that we can eat after but usually, we\u2019re all full by dinner anyways.

I am currently looking at the slide from Week 1 and it states it is \"available until 21:00pm\", from this I understood that it would be okay as long as I started it before 21:00pm. <nl><nl>Could you please inform me as soon as possible if this does mean I am getting a 0 in this test, as if you see my previous tests you can see I'm averaging around 90%, so it would be quite unfortunate to see my average decrease by such a large extent when really that was not the case. <nl><nl>Apologies for emailing so late, kind regards. <nl><nl><part_FN_SN> <nl><student_number> <new>It\u2019s for the <event> on the <DDth> <month_abbr>.<new>Name: <part_FN_MN_SN><nl><nl>Pay Number: <id_number><nl><nl>Shift: Nights<nl><nl>Location: <city> <building><nl><nl>Manager: <pers1_FN> <pers2_FN_SN> <nl><nl> <nl><nl>Good afternoon, I am still dealing with a few issues in regards to hours worked and hours paid. <nl><nl> <nl><nl>My hours for week commencing &lt;DDMMYY&gt; are as follows:<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Monday 22:00-06:00<nl><nl>Tuesday 22:00-06:00<nl><nl>Wednesday 22:00-06:00<nl><nl>Thursday 22:00-06:00<nl><nl>Friday 22:00-06:00<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Which equates to 36.666 hours including breaks (40 hours not included) but I have only been paid for 28.19 hours as stated in the attached document. <nl><nl> <nl><nl>Thank you.

But like, other than that, like, it\u2019s like when you go out to eat Mexican food, I feel like that\u2019s the best thing to go out to eat, just 'cause like the music\u2019s always good in the restaurant or like the atmosphere\u2019s always nice and like everyone\u2019s just enjoying themselves. But like, it\u2019s not too, too formal and it\u2019s quite, it\u2019s quite like you can, there\u2019s like a lot of hand food, it\u2019s like quite chilled out food. And then it\u2019s also good 'cause like you get loads of like kits and stuff so you can make it up and like it\u2019s not, and it doesn\u2019t taste bad, like every one\u2019s tasted good, I\u2019ve never. It\u2019s like pizza, like it will always taste good.<new>Erm, my favourite dish to cook is probably, erm, it\u2019s this Indian dish called, it, aloo  <unintelligible>  like it has, it\u2019s, er, potatoes and cauliflower and I, like every time we have to make at home, or like we want to make it like my, like mum always asks me to make it and like I feel like it  <unintelligible>  a lot that she wants me to make it because like she\u2019s been cooking Indian food like since she was like fifteen. So, for her to want me to make it must mean that like I make it really well. So, then I always, like, whenever she asks me to make it, I always make it quite happily because I\u2019m like, yeah, like it must be good. And I always get compliments on it. So, that what  <laugh>  drives me to make it.<new>Yeah. So, erm, first, you put the oil in the pan and like heat it up a bit. And then you put your, like you can slice your onions however you want them, like I normally like leaving them long but like some people like dicing them and stuff. Then, erm, that goes into the like hot oil and then you like, you normally brown them off, like it depends on how everybody likes to have your onions cooked, I guess. And then, erm, after that, I normally put in like ginger or garlic. Like you can have it fresh but like just out of ease, like you can buy these garlic and ginger cubes from like  <supermarket1> \u2019s and stuff and they\u2019re frozen and then you just chuck them in. And I find that way easier than just like spending time with like peeling garlic and ginger and like do all that stuff. So then, erm, yeah, I use the cubes. And then after that, I\u2019ll use chopped chillies, like normally, we have them like chopped already so then like you don\u2019t have to chop them at a reasonable time. And yeah, I put that in. And that\u2019s like a teaspoon of that. And then, erm, after that, I let that like cook for a little bit just so it\u2019s like done. And then I\u2019ll put in, erm, I put teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon of garam masala, a teaspoon of turmeric and then a teaspoon of paprika and let, then like just to taste, like if I feel like it\u2019s not going to be spicy enough, I\u2019ll put a bit of like red, like red chilli powder in, just to make it a bit more spicy. And then after that, erm, they normally like start sticking to the bottom of the pan so then I try and put some water in to keep it like\u2026 just stop it from burning. And then, erm, after that I\u2019ll put in some chopped tomatoes out of like a can and then that just makes sure it doesn\u2019t burn in it. I cook that for like normally like five minutes. And then after that, I\u2019ll put in some potatoes that I\u2019ve like peeled before and then I cook those until they\u2019re cooked about halfway. And those are like in a like a square shape, like I cut them in squares but like it just depends on how you want it. But yeah, erm, put that in. Then I cook them up until they\u2019re cooked about halfway, then I\u2019ll put in the cauliflower  <unintelligible> . The cauliflower is just cut into however big the pieces like we want to have, I guess. And then I just leave that to cook and then just stir it every so often so it doesn\u2019t stick to the bottom and burn. But, yeah, then it\u2019s all made in about like twenty minutes, half an hour  <unintelligible>  too, too bad.

Er, one white female and another Black female.

And they\u2019re both, you know, quite smiling a bit, so, erm. She\u2019s also, the teacher\u2019s also rolled their sleeves up, and she\u2019s got a black hairband on her right wrist, and she\u2019s let her blonde hair down. And erm, the student is sitting in the chair with her braids, and she\u2019s smiling quite a bit with her teeth showing as well. And erm, she\u2019s using her right hand to touch her chest, so I think they\u2019re just sharing a moment. So that\u2019s image one. And erm,  <misc>  in image two, there\u2019s a white background with a sort of uni, er, couch setup.

And they\u2019re both, er, sitting behind a Mac, and they\u2019re just looking at the computer. So I think they might be computing students or some type of technology involved in their, er, degrees also. Erm, the laptop\u2019s actually on a black sort of coffee table. And erm, yeah, it just looks like they\u2019re students on the same sort of course and, you know, just doing a bit of work together. So that\u2019s image two. And in image three, the background is almost a circle of white beads, o- placed on a black, er, background board. And it\u2019s got two, er, people in it. Er, one, er female and one male. Erm, she\u2019s wearing a leather black jacket and he\u2019s also g- holding a book. And I do believe there might be a third person in the picture but they\u2019re just out of the scene. So yeah, they\u2019re sitting on a, I think it\u2019s a red or sort of er, a rose type couch, and er, they\u2019ve got a glass coffee table in front of them. Er, the man\u2019s got a beard and, er, he\u2019s smiling quite a bit, with a green top under his black, er, inspector gadget jacket,  <laugh>  some people would say. Erm, he\u2019s wearing some, er, brown khaki trousers \u2013 no, brown trousers, yeah. And er, the lady\u2019s wearing some brown boots with red leggings, I would say. Erm, you can\u2019t really see it too caref- too well, but er, she\u2019s got some earrings I think, that are dangling. So er, yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it. So yeah, I would say they\u2019re, they\u2019re both students as well, because they\u2019ve got a book. And er, I don\u2019t know who the third character in the picture is as we can\u2019t really see, but we can just see one of his hands. But yeah.

{"id": "8fb95e26-bd69-4786-81fe-0ba6ce09007c03138", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>What is religion? Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961). This definition further criticizes religion as something which individuals turn to out of worry and desperation.<nl>In addition to the functional definitions of religion which can be seen above, there is also the substantive definition of religion which can be investigated. Substantive definitions tend to define religion in terms of its content rather than its function. Here, it is common for the existence of a \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018supernatural being\u2019 to be present when defining religion. This can be seen in Roland Robertsons definition of religion, where he states that \u2018religion refers to the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life\u2019 (Robertson, 1970). Such definitions however, can be seen as problematic to the wider community. This definition of religion by Robertson, clearly necessitates the existence of a god, and rejects any ideas that do not have a \u2018god\u2019 at the centre of their ideology to be classed as religion. This would not allow for beliefs such as Buddhism to be categorised as a religion, due to the fact that it is not based upon the concept of a creator- God (Gethin, 1998). Robertson\u2019s view on religion is supported by Max Weber, who also uses a substantive concept of religion, seeing it as a belief in a divine entity which cannot be explained scientifically (Weber, 2009). In other words, the belief in a god is required for a concept to be deemed as a religion. Ronald Dworkin however, opposes this notion and states that \u2018religion, does not necessarily mean a belief in god\u2019 and \u2018religion is an interpretive concept\u2019 (Dworkin, 2013). Dworkins use of the word \u2018interpretive\u2019, infers that religion can have a different meaning, dependent on the individual. Buddhism has now been linked to the global category of a world religion (McMahan, 2012), causing much debate upon what constitutes religion. This begs the question, who has set the requirements for what can and cannot be defined as a religion? Who has the right to dictate this? As Aldridge states \u2018Defining religion involves an exercise of power\u2019 (Aldridge, 2007).<nl><nl>Religion in International Relations- Post Secularization and Foreign Policy <nl>Often, when analysing religion within the international relations scene it can be deemed an aspect which is hastily overlooked. Religion is rarely included in most major theories of international relations and this can be ascribed to major Western social thinkers rejecting the notion of religion (Fox and Sandler, 2004), as discussed previously. As a particular scholar illustrated , \u2018the role of religion in explaining attitudes toward issues of international relations is somewhat limited\u2019 (Jelen, 1994). However, when further analysing international relations and conflict, it is clear that religion can be seen as a crucial element which should not be disregarded. It has been said that \u2018Domestic conflicts, including religious conflicts are becoming increasingly international issues\u2019 (Fox and Sandler, 2004). This extract from \u2018Bringing religion into International Relations\u2019, further emphasis the vital role that religion can play when assessing international relations. Examples of conflict which involve religion are The Israel Palestine conflict and the Thirty Years war. Here, religion can be key in resolving and understanding the clash, possibly presenting a recourse. <nl>Post secularization, it has been noted that a global resurgence of religion is transforming our understanding of international relations (Thomas, 2005). As there has been an increase in religious actors, it has recently become a vital analytical focus (Haynes,2005). These religious actors can include examples such as foreign policy taking into account religion, as well as transnational factors. The more that religion begins to play a pivotal role in making country decisions, the more clarity there is on what a substantial role religion plays on the international scene. There has previously been a narrative which has pushed the notion that the term \u2018religion\u2019 carries negative connotations and only leads to tension and ferocity, bringing nothing of substance to the international relations division. This adheres to the \u2018Westphalian presumption\u2019, which holds that \u2018religious and cultural pluralism cannot be accommodated in international public life\u2019 (Thomas, 2005). In other words, faith must be conceived as an internal matter to the sovereign state in order to avoid the risk of potential religious wars. This has encouraged using scientific knowledge and clear reasoning as justification for decisions over religion. It is clear that during these strongly secular times, there wasn\u2019t a want to define the term \u2018religion\u2019 from an international perspective. However, as religion began to make a return to the international scene, events such as 911 and Samuel Huntingtons\u2019 famous \u2018The clash of civilizations?\u2019 thesis (Huntington, 2000), only drew more attention to the importance of religion on the international relations front. As there was deemed to be a rise in religious clash and issues, with pivotal events such as 911, the topic of religion had to be assessed on the international scale. <nl>Many would also agree that religion has an important role to play in creating and shaping beliefs, which may in turn influence the formulation of state policy and foreign policy considerations. An instance of this can be seen with President George W. Bush, where he referred to the US having a \u2018calling\u2019 and \u2018mission\u2019 by the \u2018Maker of heaven\u2019 in his speeches on Foreign Policy (Judis, 2005). Not only can it be inferred here that George Bush is attempting to appeal to his majority audience with his \u2018faithful\u2019 language, but his references to God here explain how religion has had a direct impact on the foreign policy choices made. Bush\u2019s choice of language and rhetoric is extremely influential in shaping perspectives of the US citizens opinions on foreign policy. It was found here that there was a clear link between religion and opinion on U.S foreign policy in the Middle East (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). In particular, Evangelical Christians are more supportive of Bush\u2019s Foreign policy on the Iraq war and his foreign policy in general (Pew Research Centre, 2020). In a specific study carried out by Pew Research Centre, even after adjusting for the identity of the respondents groups, the impact of Evangelical beliefs towards foreign policy towards the Middle East remained statistically important (Pew Research Centre, 2020). These results are significant as they provide confirmatory proof that the position of Evangelical affiliation in shaping public opinion on foreign policy is important. It is also fundamental in understanding what a large effect a single religious group can have on how a country is run. The Middle East and President George Bush are a great area of focus due to the Iraq war being a matter which has concerned wide-spread public opinion since 2003 (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). As Boyer stated \u2018For many believers in biblical prophecy, the Bush administration\u2019s go-it-alone foreign policy, hands-off attitude toward the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and proposed war on Iraq, are not simply actions in the national self-interest or an extension of the war on terrorism, but part of an unfolding divine plan\u2019 (Boyer, 2003). This quote highlights how it is recognised that many individuals feel as though these conflicts directly involve religion and god, not only country policy. This infers that individuals will use faith as a major indicator when deciding their stance on subjects such as the Iraq war and foreign policy. On the contrary, research from the Pew Research centre suggests that people feel as though their faith does not define their opinion on the Iraq War (Different Faiths, Different Messages, 2020). Either way, the fact that there is much debate around religion probes several questions on the topic of faith, making it a valid matter when discussing international relations. As religion is increasingly being used for justification as well as indication, it is an important matter to consider on the international scene. \u00a8<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, when looking at definitions of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the context of both Sociology and International relations, it is obvious that there is much debate around what the word entails and its specific effects on society, good or bad. It is clear however, that religion has played a large role in shaping and moulding the current societies that we live in today, as well as the international relations scene, be it secular or not. Although there may be much debate upon whether the consequences of religion are \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 and \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019, the simple fact that decisions have and are being made based upon this, make it a crucial element that must be taken into consideration when looking at both society and international relations. There is no doubt that further research in the field of religion is vital and needed in order for a wider understanding of religion and its impact in both contexts.", "To whom this may concern,<nl><nl>My name is <part_FN_SN> and I\u2019m a student on the course of <course>.<nl><nl>Following the results release the link for my results has been removed from my <system>.<nl>I was trying to access it to see the next steps I need to take as it has information of deferred modules and referred modules.<nl><nl>Could you please re instate the link on my <system> or assist with me the deffered examination dates and other such information.<nl><nl>Hope to hear from you soon.<nl><nl>Kind regards,<nl><nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hi <addr1_NN>, <nl>There are reading lists that are given to you for each module - so dependant on what modules you picked and if they are some of the ones I did, I could potentially give you a head start and send you the corresponding reading lists.

Er, one white female and another Black female. And I can just tell by the way the\u2026 okay, so the background is white as well, and the, the white female\u2019s standing up and almost bending over, and er, I can see it\u2019s a sort of teacher and student relationship. And they\u2019re both, you know, quite smiling a bit, so, erm. She\u2019s also, the teacher\u2019s also rolled their sleeves up, and she\u2019s got a black hairband on her right wrist, and she\u2019s let her blonde hair down. And erm, the student is sitting in the chair with her braids, and she\u2019s smiling quite a bit with her teeth showing as well. And erm, she\u2019s using her right hand to touch her chest, so I think they\u2019re just sharing a moment. So that\u2019s image one. And erm,  <misc>  in image two, there\u2019s a white background with a sort of uni, er, couch setup. And there\u2019s two males; er, one who\u2019s got a black earring in his left ear, and er, another who\u2019s also wearing a red, er, red shirt over a white, er, t-shirt. And they\u2019re both, er, sitting behind a Mac, and they\u2019re just looking at the computer. So I think they might be computing students or some type of technology involved in their, er, degrees also. Erm, the laptop\u2019s actually on a black sort of coffee table. And erm, yeah, it just looks like they\u2019re students on the same sort of course and, you know, just doing a bit of work together. So that\u2019s image two. And in image three, the background is almost a circle of white beads, o- placed on a black, er, background board. And it\u2019s got two, er, people in it. Er, one, er female and one male. Erm, she\u2019s wearing a leather black jacket and he\u2019s also g- holding a book. And I do believe there might be a third person in the picture but they\u2019re just out of the scene. So yeah, they\u2019re sitting on a, I think it\u2019s a red or sort of er, a rose type couch, and er, they\u2019ve got a glass coffee table in front of them. Er, the man\u2019s got a beard and, er, he\u2019s smiling quite a bit, with a green top under his black, er, inspector gadget jacket,  <laugh>  some people would say. Erm, he\u2019s wearing some, er, brown khaki trousers \u2013 no, brown trousers, yeah. And er, the lady\u2019s wearing some brown boots with red leggings, I would say. Erm, you can\u2019t really see it too caref- too well, but er, she\u2019s got some earrings I think, that are dangling. So er, yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it. So yeah, I would say they\u2019re, they\u2019re both students as well, because they\u2019ve got a book. And er, I don\u2019t know who the third character in the picture is as we can\u2019t really see, but we can just see one of his hands. But yeah.

Erm, I'm not really sure I have one but, mm, I\u2019ve recently got into, erm, Chinese food recently, recently. But erm, what\u2019s my favourite cuisine? I don\u2019t really have one, I\u2019ll just I like a mixture of things.<new>Erm, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just quite different and it\u2019s not the typical, erm, yeah, potatoes or steak or fries or whatever. It\u2019s just a different sort of, like a whole different country, different culture, different taste, different flavours. So, but, erm, something like dumplings, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have it on a normal day in your house. So, if I had that. And then yeah, you could go to the basic stuff like, er, egg fried rice or chicken fried rice, king prawn fried rice but, yeah, just different culture, I\u2019d say.<new>Oh, my favourite dish to cook. Erm, I mean, I can cook but I wouldn\u2019t say I'm the  <chef>  of the house  <laugh> . So, there\u2019s not much of a, a range to pick from. But erm, I would say, I can make my own roasts quite well, actually, er.<new>Yeah.<new><laugh> , okay. So, erm, it starts by getting your King Edward potatoes in. They usually have a bit of a red tint to them on the outside. So, then you just wash the potatoes, peel them, er, put a bit of salt, a bit of herbs on them, you know, cut them up, er, mix it all together. Then that\u2019s the potatoes done. And a trick my mum taught me is that you can boil the potatoes for a bit before you put them in the oven, which makes them all fluffy and actually cooks them quicker. So yeah, you season it all up and then I actually boil it. Then you put it into the oven and then that\u2019s the potatoes done. Then you get the sausages out of the pack, er, place it on a tray on the foil, put it inside the oven. Then the gravy, it\u2019s, it looks simple but it\u2019s actually kind of hard to make because if you get it too thick, like you\u2019re just eating slob. And if it\u2019s too thin, it\u2019s just water. So, you\u2019ve just got to, as you\u2019re pouring in the hot water, pour in the gra-, the granules at the same time and mix it consistently, otherwise, if you get lumps or it gets all thin, it\u2019s not really going to taste the best. So, whilst you\u2019re doing all of that, the ovens and the sausages are inside. So, erm, really and truly, when you\u2019re making the gravy, you\u2019re practically done. And then, obviously, you\u2019re boiling up all the carrots, the broccolis and then you plate up and you\u2019re done."]}

This is because from day one it has always been difficult to fully close it - partly due to the design of the cupboard door and the fact that the freezer isn\u2019t working properly and as a result the ice builds up and doesn\u2019t allow it to close. This further prevents the fridge from closing properly in addition to the cupboard design door. This ongoing issue has resulted in numerous amounts of food not being kept properly and the unfortunate throwing away of them. We are all experiencing hard times as we attempt to continue living with COVID19, therefore the continuous cycle of buying food and it going off due to a dysfucntional and ineffective fridge makes these times just that much harder.<nl><nl>A contractor was sent out once and the service he provided was not good enough as this is still a very important issue - if not the most important as it directly effects our health and safety.<nl><nl>Another issue in the kitchen is that one of the lower cabinet doors has come off.

The bottom part of it has opened and essentially began to peel off. This also needs to be fixed because if its allowed to continue peeling the wall behind it will start to get wet from the sink and cause further damage to the property.<nl><nl>In line with maintenance requests, it has also been brought to my attention that the top floor tenant is extremely unhappy with the mattress she is having to use as she says all she can feel is the springs within it. This causes severe joint and shoulder pain - again this is important as it has a direct impact on her health. If this could be replaced it would be most helpful, as we are timely paying tenants who don\u2019t believe this to be an unjust request.<nl><nl>I did contact the <business> property management mobile contact number ending 152, I was directed to report all maintenance issues through property file.

{"id": "352ba8c9-7fc7-4768-aa44-6d9fe554763e08029", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["The Modern State is seen to have five key features: sovereignty, public institutions, territorial association, legitimation and domination (D\u2019Amato, 2018). These characteristics can be highlighted as territory (an area with defined borders), external and internal sovereignty where a state must be able to defend its territory and not be too dependent on another power. A state achieves sovereignty when it is recognised by the family of states as the \u2018sole governing authority within its territory and as the legal equal of other states\u2019 (The Modern State, 2020). Furthermore, there has to be legitimacy in which there is recognised rule, examples of this are traditional legitimacy, charismatic legitimacy and rational-legal legitimacy; the legitimacy enhances a state\u2019s sovereignty at a lower cost. The last characteristic is modern bureaucracy, this is required to generate as well as collect revenue. In this essay we will be discussing and critically examining Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, who criticizes the moralistic view of authority. Machiavelli although seen as an evil man, had a large influence on the future of modern civilisation especially in comparison to the artists of his time. <nl><nl>For Machiavelli, moral basis on which to judge the difference between illegitimate and legitimate uses of power does not exist, arguing that this does not add to the actual possession of power \u2013 rather the legitimacy rests upon the threat of coercive force. His beliefs rest in those that the leaders should avoid the common values of justice and mercy in preference to the use of violence and fear, particularly if it is in the best interest such as through gaining and expanding political power. Historians have stated Machiavelli to be the \u2018teacher of evil\u2019 such as Leo Strauss (McShea, 1963). However, Machiavelli has been credited with formulating the \"modern concept of the state\", that is understood in the Weberian sense of a \u2018form of rule possessing a monopoly of coercive authority within a set territorial boundary\u2019 (Nederman, 2019). Machiavelli derived his views from the experience of the Caesura Borgia.  However, Machiavelli did contribute to the way we understand the modern state now as he proposed his own conception of the \"civil principality\" whilst subverting his previous medieval idea of state as regime (Sellers,2015). However, it should be noted that force is not the only weapon to rule the people so his argument can be seen as psychologically weak.<nl><nl>Machiavelli also states that principality can be seen to be governed by a single ruler and is helped by anointed ministers which is the case in many current states seen today. Machiavelli states that the idea of taking over depends on the character of region than the character of the prince, he has the strong belief that the citizens will recollect and fight for their liberty. Although we have grown out of medieval brutality, it can be argued that the modern-day equivalent of killing is to send rivals to jail or allow opponents to lose if there is indecisiveness. An example of this is Brexit, where the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was seen as indecisive and therefore could not gain enough votes in time for the referendum. Another way Machiavelli is modernised is through the idea that leaders will need to make severe decisions, such as through firing a member of the cabinet. An example of this is the Night of Long Knives in 1962 where Macmillan sacked a third of his cabinet. Nevertheless, Machiavelli ignored individualism and had one sided views of human nature which can be viewed as a critical flaw.<nl><nl>For Machiavelli, law is also impossible to follow without the required military as arms are a requirement in order for leaders to establish great frameworks. Although it can be criticised as we do not follow medieval combat, there are still some aspects which apply to the modern state, for instance the concept that an army from your own principality is most beneficial for defending yourself \u2013 and this concept is universally accepted. Machiavelli also made the point that there is conflict of interest which can be seen in the modern state also, for example through the leak of the Panama papers. What is also seen in the modern state is Machiavelli\u2019s view on auxiliary troops being faithful to someone else, for example through the rise of the Taliban, as although it was intended for the Taliban to fight the Soviet Union, they later turned and became the lead terrorist group. In Antonio Negri\u2019s view, Machiavelli belongs to a \u2018political alternative of modern thought grounded on a revolutionary version of constituent power\u2019 (Negri and Maurizia Boscagli, 2009). However, Quentin Skinner and J.G.A Pocock write that we should regard Machiavelli as part of the republican tradition, i.e. as part of the living legacy of Aristotelian philosophy (Roecklein, 2012). Nonetheless, Machiavelli was the first modern thinker to have thought of the State as an independent entity and not recognising any religious organisation exterior to it and The Prince has been a choice of several political leaders such as Louis XIV, Napoleon Bonaparte and Benito Mussolini. <nl><nl>The modern state was \u2018constituted by an abstraction from personal to impersonal rule\u2019 (Mansfield, 1983). With Machiavelli we encounter a challenge to the classical regime which is expressed in his use of stato (his stato is someone\u2019s to acquire), whereas for Aristotle\u2019s regime there is some ordering of the inhabitants of the city. The central theme of Machiavelli\u2019s political ideas is power with absolute state being the end. The state is viewed as superior to all associations and is sovereign as well as autonomous however he also stated that religion cannot influence politics and the church cannot control the state, which is not the case. <nl><nl>Comparing Machiavelli to other theorists allows for us to critically evaluate him further. Plato had the vision of every human being born into a division which was maintained and creating an arrangement for the state in the course of classism whereas Machiavelli proposed with the aim of sovereignty to support the nation in which the leader controls and protects its citizens. Machiavelli\u2019s concept of virt\u00fa highlights the utilitarian needs of the country. For Machiavelli virt\u00fa outweighs virtue in times of need whilst Plato believes a \u2018just ruler must behave the same at all times\u2019 however we have to consider they were writing in different eras, as Plato\u2019s philosophy is based on utopian principles and Machiavelli is viewed as a realist (Abrams, M, 2017). Aristotle divides government into two categories: good and bad with good forms fall aristocracy and under bad fall oligarchy. Aristotle wanted to help society achieve goodness through politics whereas on the other hand Machiavelli sought to achieve the maintenance of power and stability. They have differing views in terms of Aristotle claimed that if an entire state is made to fear their ruler, this would cause unhappiness however Machiavelli suggested that it is better to be feared than loved as it creates balance. However, they are on similar sides when it comes to liberation, as in the Prince it stated such ruler should not dictate the actions of others, but all together Machiavelli was seeking a practical type of politics whilst Aristotle took a rather idealistic approach (Tabone, 2020).  <nl><nl>Hobbes and Machiavelli have fascinating ideas on human nature impacting the state as the common theme is the usage of fear, meaning power needs to be acquired and maintained but we have to remember that Machiavelli\u2019s time period involved the peak of absolutism and hierarchies. Philosophers such a John Locke have directly opposing views on government. Locke\u2019s perception of revolt as a right gave people excessive power compared to the government, this did not exist during the time of Machiavelli. Locke believed in the idea of the government working for the people, however this is directly opposed to Machiavelli\u2019s thought that the ruler should do what it takes to remain in power (Chris Joseph, 2014). Machiavelli recommended that coercion should be used in order to govern whereas Locke favoured a social contract with the concept of dual accountability. Although Machiavelli\u2019s concept of coercion is flawed, he did recognise that rulers could not govern by this alone and advocated for the use of cunning and subterfuge, Locke\u2019s social contract did not contain an element of this. Machiavelli had a pessimistic view of individuals and believed human beings are fundamentally bad whereas Locke was more optimistic. In the modern state it follows Machiavelli\u2019s model more as the rulers in the modern state are comprised of the rich and powerful in society. Mill and Machiavelli also have the same solution to government in freedom of speech, they are both aware that people cannot have a hand in ruling itself. <nl><nl>Political leaders and their followers believed that Machiavellism was a disease infesting the politic body. He is still regarded with a negative reputation, but he still aids us to understand the modern state. Machiavelli promoted the central role of a citizen in preserving institutions which is reflected through the meaning of the Second Amendment in the U.S. Constitution (Bernard, 2009). Among modern believers of Machiavelli, there are Burmese generals such as Web Jiabao, the Former Premier of China and Lord Mandelson (Bernard, 2009). Machiavelli and Pareto agree in terms of this where they say egotism or selfishness as a natural property of the human species (Femia, 2013). According to Machiavellism though, the principle aim of prince is the unification as well as welfare of the state which showed reality of practical politics. He deduced that the internal unity and powerful government were the essential of any state by observing the affairs of the interstate rivalries. The sole aim of the prince is also to increase power in ways such as to be an expert in managing and organising a war- power is seen as the only reason of the state. <nl><nl>To conclude Machiavelli contributes to the \u2018comprehension of constituent power as a living force within social order\u2019 (Lucchese, 2016). He developed a revolutionary position, suggesting that political conflict is not a destabilising factor, but rather the grounding force of free republics. His concepts and ideas are often misunderstood as he displayed rare intellect to become a partisan in an age where absolute monarchy held control (Mathur, 1991). All together Machiavelli was the first thinker who justified secular state and the first advocate for autonomy for the state. He unfairly became associated with evil through his critical work written about The Prince, and although it did not get translated until almost a hundred years later the negative view about Machiavelli had already been established into Elizabethan England. All together he communicated priority to the state and put it above morality and religion as it is the highest form of social organisation and most essential to promote human welfare, and this is seen clearly in the modern state. Machiavelli\u2019s Prince dealt exclusively with the interests of a single person of power that focuses on only the leader\u2019s welfare in mind whereas the theories of Plato, Aristotle, Locke and Mill dealt with the welfare of society. However, in the modern state there Machiavelli did consider that the Prince needed to maintain good relations with the people which is what we observe. It can be agreed the way that Machiavelli talks about the state as Machiavelli was a realist.", "Good evening, <nl><nl>As our research question is <assignment_title><nl><nl>The essay structure outline is that <pers1_FN_SN> is doing 18th century politics and John Locke's interpretation, I am doing McCarthyism and the influence this had on socialism in the United States, <pers2_FN_SN1_SN2> is doing a paragraph on Communism and the Cold War, <pers3_FN_SN> is doing a paragraph on the American empire and the successes of American Capitalism. <nl><nl>Also, <pers4_FN_SN> has not responded to my email and it has been two weeks, we are not sure what to do. <nl><nl><nl><nl>Thank you, kind regards.<nl><nl><part_FN><nl><student_number><new>Please could my group and I have the slot for 1:40pm on the <DDth> <month>, if that is not available is it possible if we could have the 1:20pm slot. <nl><nl>From <part_FN> (<student_number>) <nl><nl>My group is: <part_FN>, <pers1_FN>, <pers2_FN>. <new>1:20 is perfect thank you<new>Good afternoon, to whoever this may concern<nl>My name is <part_FN_SN>, and I attend <city>- <university>. <nl>My customer ID is <id_number>.<nl><nl>I am requesting for my next instalment on &lt;DDMMYY&gt; to be made void please, and I will remove all of my belongings from my room and the kitchen by the <DDth> of <month>.

{"id": "79a28ae4-a362-480f-a0af-df183b5c4830", "discourse_types": ["essay", "speech_transcription"], "pair": ["Abstract<nl>Alpha activity is higher in periods of inattentiveness, and is suppressed when completing tasks. Due to contralateral processing, P3 should remain inattentive when shown a stimuli on the left. By using EEG, alpha activity can be recorded when shown a stimuli cued left or cued right. Event markers allow for it to be clear when the participant is shown the stimuli, and the alpha activity was recorded. The results showed that there was a significantly higher in left than right cue condition, and supported the hypothesis.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha activity refers to electrical impulses oscillating at 8-13Hz , this is an alpha wave. These brain waves begin in the cerebral cortex (Moini &amp; Piran, 2020) and occur during periods of inattention, where one is in a restful state, whilst being awake, examples of this is when closing eyes, meditating (Lagopoulos et al., 2009), daydreaming etc.  When the brain begins to focus on stimuli, alpha waves are suppressed. The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007), proposes that high alpha indicates disengagement and inhibition of task irrelevant brain areas. In task relevant brain areas, alpha remains low, supporting that alpha activity is modulated by attention.  <nl><nl>This hypothesis is supported by Magosso et al, 2019, which used a regular setting and a VR (virtual reality) setting to see if the intensity of the task and the levels of attention required affects alpha frequency. The results showed that alpha signals are suppressed when having to give attention to tasks although it seems that when isolated from all external features (when participating in VR) alpha activity becomes greater. This suggests that it is the modulation and diversion of attention which causes changes in alpha frequencies.<nl><nl>Sauseng et al (2005) presented participants with directional cues indicating which hemifield the target stimuli would appear in. The target stimuli consisted of either small or large bars which participants identified and responded with \u2018s\u2019 for small and \u2018l\u2019 for large. Results showed that there was stronger alpha frequency suppression in brain areas contralateral to the targeted hemifield. This is due to visual stimuli being processed contralaterally. 200ms before the stimuli was presented, in active processing areas like the parietal lobe (P3), the alpha range is also lower. This study is supportive of AIM (Klimesch et al, 2007), and is used as the basis for this experiment, as it is a partial replication. In this experiment, the focus will be on the effect of arrow cues, specifically the direction they are facing.<nl><nl>Hypothesis<nl>As AIH states, alpha range activity is present in areas that are uninvolved in active processing and is suppressed in areas that actively process. By directing attention, and cueing the participant to expect the stimuli in a specific region they will begin paying attention. As shown by Sauseng et al (2005), visual stimuli is processed contralaterally resulting in alpha suppression in the other side of the brain. For example, if the stimuli is present in the left visual field it will be processed by the right hemisphere. By using the left parietal cortex (P3) to record alpha activity, it is expected that alpha activity will be greater when a stimulus is shown on the left and for this activity to be suppressed when the stimuli is on the right.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 undergraduate students were participants chosen from an opportunity sample.<nl><nl>Design<nl>This experiment uses a within subjects design. The dependent variable is the alpha range amplitudes (microvolts) on the left hand side of the parietal lobe (P3). The independent variable is the direction of the arrow cue, with two levels, left or right. <nl>Materials<nl>This experiment used a Biopac MP36 to collect data, EEG electrodes, AC Cream, Abrasive paste, PsychoPy to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device and stimuli (see figure 1). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG by opening the Biopac student lab. From the \u2018analog\u2019 tab select Electroencaphagram (EEG)\u2019 \u20180.5-100Hz wnotch\u2019, so the 50Hz band is filtered out. Digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker.. The \u2018calculation\u2019 tab allowed alpha frequency to be recorded. Then select \u2018EEG alpha 8-13Hz\u2019 from the drop down list. The sampling rate was 1000Hz. The participant was then prepared to be attached to the EEG. The electrode sites were abraded with everi cream using a cotton bud, and then AC cream was put on the electrodes. The electrodes are placed using the 1020 system. The active electrode was placed on P3. Participants were then given a cued visual task. A fixation cross was cued at the centre of the screen for 34ms, followed by an arrow indicating where to focus attention, with a 50% chance of it being cued left or right. There was then an interval of 600-800ms followed by a fixation cross for the second time, finally the participant was shown the target stimuli for 50ms, either a large or small white bar against a black background. Participants were then asked to use the keyboard to respond to the stimuli, typing either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. 75% of the trials were valid (the target stimuli was presented in the same hemifield that the arrow cue indicated), and 25% were invalid (the target stimuli was presented in the other hemifield). There were 20 blocks of the four trial types (cue left with a small bar, cue right with a small bar, cue left with a large bar and cue right with a large bar) so in total there were 80 trials.<nl><nl>Results<nl>There were transformations applied to the raw 9-13Hz alpha EEG data. There were eventmarkers received by PsychoPy through the Stimtracker, in order to identify when the stimuli was presented to the participants. The data also was used to specifically analyse from 200ms prior to stimulus onset after the directional arrow cues had been shown. Furthermore, the data was rectified, making negative values positive despite them showing excitatory or inhibitory activity. The samples were also averaged in order to limit the impact that outlying values would have on the data. This data is referred to as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl><nl>Descriptive Statistics<nl><table><nl><nl>Inferential Statistics <nl>The wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T=566, n=38, p=.002).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results of this experiment show that there was a significantly higher level of alpha activity when the stimulus was shown on the left hand side, this fit the original hypothesis. These results are consistent with AIH (Klimesch et al, 2007) as it shows that when participants are given a stimulus in their left hemifield, due to contralateral processing, this is processed by the right part of brain areas. As we were looking at P3, the left side of the parietal lobe, when shown a cue on the left it was processed on the right, meaning the left was task irrelevant and inattentive, resulting in higher alpha activity.<nl><nl>Methodological Problems<nl>Factors which may have confounded data include artefacts, which is when the EEG is contaminated by excess movement. When eye movements take place, the electrical activity could be recorded as brain activity. Eye movements could be blinking or horizontal eye movement, especially when having to look at either side of the screen. Blinking could also pose other issues such as the participant missing the cue. However, it does not seem to be too much of an issue and repetition and more trials would minimise the effects of this.<nl>Another issue could be the laboratory setting, as this could have an affect on brain activity. This is not a very normal situation for participants to be placed in so they may be uncomfortable or more alert as they know they are being studied. This could impact the EEG recordings as it is not a life-like situation so the results may not be generalisable to the whole population.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Overall, the data is valid despite minor methodological issues, which after replication can minimise the effect of individual differences, such as blinking and horizontal eye movement. The data also supports AIH and produced the expected results.", "So in the image one there\u2019s er, two people. Er, one white female and another Black female. And I can just tell by the way the\u2026 okay, so the background is white as well, and the, the white female\u2019s standing up and almost bending over, and er, I can see it\u2019s a sort of teacher and student relationship. And they\u2019re both, you know, quite smiling a bit, so, erm. She\u2019s also, the teacher\u2019s also rolled their sleeves up, and she\u2019s got a black hairband on her right wrist, and she\u2019s let her blonde hair down. And erm, the student is sitting in the chair with her braids, and she\u2019s smiling quite a bit with her teeth showing as well. And erm, she\u2019s using her right hand to touch her chest, so I think they\u2019re just sharing a moment. So that\u2019s image one. And erm,  <misc>  in image two, there\u2019s a white background with a sort of uni, er, couch setup. And there\u2019s two males; er, one who\u2019s got a black earring in his left ear, and er, another who\u2019s also wearing a red, er, red shirt over a white, er, t-shirt. And they\u2019re both, er, sitting behind a Mac, and they\u2019re just looking at the computer. So I think they might be computing students or some type of technology involved in their, er, degrees also. Erm, the laptop\u2019s actually on a black sort of coffee table. And erm, yeah, it just looks like they\u2019re students on the same sort of course and, you know, just doing a bit of work together. So that\u2019s image two. And in image three, the background is almost a circle of white beads, o- placed on a black, er, background board. And it\u2019s got two, er, people in it. Er, one, er female and one male. Erm, she\u2019s wearing a leather black jacket and he\u2019s also g- holding a book. And I do believe there might be a third person in the picture but they\u2019re just out of the scene. So yeah, they\u2019re sitting on a, I think it\u2019s a red or sort of er, a rose type couch, and er, they\u2019ve got a glass coffee table in front of them. Er, the man\u2019s got a beard and, er, he\u2019s smiling quite a bit, with a green top under his black, er, inspector gadget jacket,  <laugh>  some people would say. Erm, he\u2019s wearing some, er, brown khaki trousers \u2013 no, brown trousers, yeah. And er, the lady\u2019s wearing some brown boots with red leggings, I would say. Erm, you can\u2019t really see it too caref- too well, but er, she\u2019s got some earrings I think, that are dangling. So er, yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it. So yeah, I would say they\u2019re, they\u2019re both students as well, because they\u2019ve got a book. And er, I don\u2019t know who the third character in the picture is as we can\u2019t really see, but we can just see one of his hands. But yeah. And there\u2019s a leaflet on the glass coffee table in front of them. And that\u2019s it for picture three."]}

One is sat down wearing a denim jacket, and she has twists in her hair. The other woman is wearing a black and white stripey top, dark blue jeans and a belt. So number one consists of the lady in the denim jacket sitting down, she\u2019s staring at something and her mouth is wide open. She has quite a surprised, but in a positive way, erm, her facial feature shows that she is looking at something which is surprising. And the other lady, on the right of her, is looking downwards towards something. Erm, also the lady with the black and white stripey top has medium length hair, is quite fair skinned, has dark brown hair going into more of an ombr\u00e9 blonde. Whereas the other lady sat down is, she is a Black lady, with black twists. Also, by the picture, it looks like the lady in the black and white top is showing er, her friend next to her, they look like they know each other. And yeah, they look like they\u2019re friends. They look like they are s- in some sort of maybe school environment. It\u2019s a casual environment, which is seen by the clothes that they are wearing. Another way this picture can also be seen is the lady in the denim jacket is looking, n-not looking at something that the girl in the black and white top is showing her, she\u2019s actually looking at something else, and that she\u2019s surprised by what she\u2019s seen because her mouth is wide open. In the second picture, it looks like erm, there are two boys in this picture. One is of South Asian descent, has short black hair and is wearing a black and red chequered shirt with a white top underneath, and there\u2019s a boy next to him on the, his left. And he\u2019s quite fair skinned, has a black ear piercing, and has short brown hair. He\u2019s wearing a top which consists of black and white flowers with red writing on top, but you can\u2019t read the writing. And the guy in the black and red sweatshirt is staring at a MacBook Air, and, er, looks really interested in what he is reading. Whereas his friend next to him is either staring at him, or there is something that\u2019s distracted him that\u2019s next to the guy in the black and red sweatshirt. From the looks of it, because of how close they are, they look like friends. And they look like university students, or a little bit older. They, yeah, they look around the age of between eighteen to er twenty-two. Yeah. In the background actually there are light green and dark green spots, with a black background, which looks like either a wallpaper or it looks like they\u2019re sitting down on a sofa which has that background. And the table that the MacBook is on is a wooden table with different shades of brown, giving it that timber sort of effect. Yeah. In the third picture, there is a Black female and on her left is a South Asian male. South Asian male has a beard and almost a buzz cut which has grown out. And he is wearing a dark green shirt with a long black coat that has buttons on the side, and also a long collar with beige trousers, dark beige trousers, and he is wearing black trainers. In the background of these two people there is a sort of spiral, almost hypnotising effect, sort of wallpaper. Which is, consists of many small, round, white circles across a black backdrop. The girl is wearing a black top with a black leather jacket, and is holding something in her hand, which I can\u2019t see it. Oh, she\u2019s holding something and it looks like there is also a hand in the picture, next to both of her hands. She\u2019s also wearing dark maroon leggings, with light brown leather boots. There is a table in front of them which has something on the glass table, which consists of either leaflets or pamphlets. And yeah, the male is also holding a book which he\u2019s gone through about, I\u2019d say, fifty per cent of. He looks like he\u2019s in the middle of the book; he looks like he\u2019s about to turn a page. They both are staring at the same thing, it looks like, because their eyes are in the same direction. They are both smiling. Erm, you can tell they\u2019re both quite comfortable with each other because of how close they are sat to each other. It looks like they are almost friends. It also looks like they may be students as well, because that looks like quite a big book. So yeah, number three has, you can tell they\u2019re both looking at something which makes them happy, or is something that is amusing to them. Because neither of them look confused. I-I think they both look eager to know more.", "<unintelligible>  might make it tonight for dinner.<new>My favourite restaurant. Oh, gosh. It would have to be, I\u2019ve been to so many lately.

It would have to be  <restaurant1> , which is near, a restaurant, a Thai restaurant near where I live. We went there for my dad\u2019s fiftieth when restaurants were open. And my favourite dish there, they do these lamb skewers erm, but with a like a honey sauce that I didn\u2019t think the two originally went good together but I had to order like  <unintelligible>  of those starters, it was really bad. Like I sat there, oh it was so bad, just like dunking the skewers into the, erm, honey sauce. That was amazing. And then, the prawn toast in the sweet chilli sauce. And I think I had red Thai curry, red Thai curry but with, erm, chicken and fish, which is weird because usually we\u2019d have it just with chicken but I had it with chicken and fish this time and I would have to, I\u2019m just patiently waiting for restaurants to open so I can go, go and  <laugh>  get that again. But that was prob-, that\u2019s probably my go to meal, wherever I go, I\u2019m going to try red Thai curry.<new>Oh gosh, this is\u2026 special meal I ever had? It would probably be when my friend and I, we both, erm, had some really successful achievements. So, we decided to go all out and go out to celebrate. And we ended up going to  <restaurant2> . So, that would probably. And the food there, as ridiculously expensive as it was, actually, that was probably one of my most special meals just because, you know, when you sit down and you don\u2019t have anything to stress about when you\u2019re eating your food? Like, there\u2019s like, you\u2019ve just done something amazing, it\u2019s about time you go and enjoy. So, yeah, I think at  <restaurant2> , I had, what did I have? I think I had a prawn curry with rice and that was really nice. And I also had like a lamb steak sort of thing that was really good. But that, I think that was my most special meal. Just because I, we all used to think the price that you pay for  <restaurant2> , surely, like the food can\u2019t be that good? And it was, a hundred, a hundred percent was, like I would go back again and this time not have a budget and just  <laugh>  try some, try more than I did before.

So, but, erm, something like dumplings, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have it on a normal day in your house. So, if I had that. And then yeah, you could go to the basic stuff like, er, egg fried rice or chicken fried rice, king prawn fried rice but, yeah, just different culture, I\u2019d say.<new>Oh, my favourite dish to cook.

They usually have a bit of a red tint to them on the outside. So, then you just wash the potatoes, peel them, er, put a bit of salt, a bit of herbs on them, you know, cut them up, er, mix it all together. Then that\u2019s the potatoes done. And a trick my mum taught me is that you can boil the potatoes for a bit before you put them in the oven, which makes them all fluffy and actually cooks them quicker. So yeah, you season it all up and then I actually boil it. Then you put it into the oven and then that\u2019s the potatoes done. Then you get the sausages out of the pack, er, place it on a tray on the foil, put it inside the oven. Then the gravy, it\u2019s, it looks simple but it\u2019s actually kind of hard to make because if you get it too thick, like you\u2019re just eating slob. And if it\u2019s too thin, it\u2019s just water. So, you\u2019ve just got to, as you\u2019re pouring in the hot water, pour in the gra-, the granules at the same time and mix it consistently, otherwise, if you get lumps or it gets all thin, it\u2019s not really going to taste the best. So, whilst you\u2019re doing all of that, the ovens and the sausages are inside. So, erm, really and truly, when you\u2019re making the gravy, you\u2019re practically done.

Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}

Due to contralateral processing, P3 should remain inattentive when shown a stimuli on the left. By using EEG, alpha activity can be recorded when shown a stimuli cued left or cued right. Event markers allow for it to be clear when the participant is shown the stimuli, and the alpha activity was recorded. The results showed that there was a significantly higher in left than right cue condition, and supported the hypothesis.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha activity refers to electrical impulses oscillating at 8-13Hz , this is an alpha wave. These brain waves begin in the cerebral cortex (Moini &amp; Piran, 2020) and occur during periods of inattention, where one is in a restful state, whilst being awake, examples of this is when closing eyes, meditating (Lagopoulos et al., 2009), daydreaming etc.  When the brain begins to focus on stimuli, alpha waves are suppressed. The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007), proposes that high alpha indicates disengagement and inhibition of task irrelevant brain areas. In task relevant brain areas, alpha remains low, supporting that alpha activity is modulated by attention.  <nl><nl>This hypothesis is supported by Magosso et al, 2019, which used a regular setting and a VR (virtual reality) setting to see if the intensity of the task and the levels of attention required affects alpha frequency. The results showed that alpha signals are suppressed when having to give attention to tasks although it seems that when isolated from all external features (when participating in VR) alpha activity becomes greater. This suggests that it is the modulation and diversion of attention which causes changes in alpha frequencies.<nl><nl>Sauseng et al (2005) presented participants with directional cues indicating which hemifield the target stimuli would appear in. The target stimuli consisted of either small or large bars which participants identified and responded with \u2018s\u2019 for small and \u2018l\u2019 for large. Results showed that there was stronger alpha frequency suppression in brain areas contralateral to the targeted hemifield. This is due to visual stimuli being processed contralaterally. 200ms before the stimuli was presented, in active processing areas like the parietal lobe (P3), the alpha range is also lower. This study is supportive of AIM (Klimesch et al, 2007), and is used as the basis for this experiment, as it is a partial replication. In this experiment, the focus will be on the effect of arrow cues, specifically the direction they are facing.<nl><nl>Hypothesis<nl>As AIH states, alpha range activity is present in areas that are uninvolved in active processing and is suppressed in areas that actively process. By directing attention, and cueing the participant to expect the stimuli in a specific region they will begin paying attention. As shown by Sauseng et al (2005), visual stimuli is processed contralaterally resulting in alpha suppression in the other side of the brain. For example, if the stimuli is present in the left visual field it will be processed by the right hemisphere. By using the left parietal cortex (P3) to record alpha activity, it is expected that alpha activity will be greater when a stimulus is shown on the left and for this activity to be suppressed when the stimuli is on the right.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 undergraduate students were participants chosen from an opportunity sample.<nl><nl>Design<nl>This experiment uses a within subjects design. The dependent variable is the alpha range amplitudes (microvolts) on the left hand side of the parietal lobe (P3). The independent variable is the direction of the arrow cue, with two levels, left or right. <nl>Materials<nl>This experiment used a Biopac MP36 to collect data, EEG electrodes, AC Cream, Abrasive paste, PsychoPy to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device and stimuli (see figure 1). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG by opening the Biopac student lab. From the \u2018analog\u2019 tab select Electroencaphagram (EEG)\u2019 \u20180.5-100Hz wnotch\u2019, so the 50Hz band is filtered out. Digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker.. The \u2018calculation\u2019 tab allowed alpha frequency to be recorded. Then select \u2018EEG alpha 8-13Hz\u2019 from the drop down list. The sampling rate was 1000Hz. The participant was then prepared to be attached to the EEG. The electrode sites were abraded with everi cream using a cotton bud, and then AC cream was put on the electrodes. The electrodes are placed using the 1020 system. The active electrode was placed on P3. Participants were then given a cued visual task. A fixation cross was cued at the centre of the screen for 34ms, followed by an arrow indicating where to focus attention, with a 50% chance of it being cued left or right. There was then an interval of 600-800ms followed by a fixation cross for the second time, finally the participant was shown the target stimuli for 50ms, either a large or small white bar against a black background. Participants were then asked to use the keyboard to respond to the stimuli, typing either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. 75% of the trials were valid (the target stimuli was presented in the same hemifield that the arrow cue indicated), and 25% were invalid (the target stimuli was presented in the other hemifield). There were 20 blocks of the four trial types (cue left with a small bar, cue right with a small bar, cue left with a large bar and cue right with a large bar) so in total there were 80 trials.<nl><nl>Results<nl>There were transformations applied to the raw 9-13Hz alpha EEG data. There were eventmarkers received by PsychoPy through the Stimtracker, in order to identify when the stimuli was presented to the participants. The data also was used to specifically analyse from 200ms prior to stimulus onset after the directional arrow cues had been shown. Furthermore, the data was rectified, making negative values positive despite them showing excitatory or inhibitory activity. The samples were also averaged in order to limit the impact that outlying values would have on the data. This data is referred to as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl><nl>Descriptive Statistics<nl><table><nl><nl>Inferential Statistics <nl>The wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T=566, n=38, p=.002).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results of this experiment show that there was a significantly higher level of alpha activity when the stimulus was shown on the left hand side, this fit the original hypothesis. These results are consistent with AIH (Klimesch et al, 2007) as it shows that when participants are given a stimulus in their left hemifield, due to contralateral processing, this is processed by the right part of brain areas. As we were looking at P3, the left side of the parietal lobe, when shown a cue on the left it was processed on the right, meaning the left was task irrelevant and inattentive, resulting in higher alpha activity.<nl><nl>Methodological Problems<nl>Factors which may have confounded data include artefacts, which is when the EEG is contaminated by excess movement. When eye movements take place, the electrical activity could be recorded as brain activity. Eye movements could be blinking or horizontal eye movement, especially when having to look at either side of the screen. Blinking could also pose other issues such as the participant missing the cue. However, it does not seem to be too much of an issue and repetition and more trials would minimise the effects of this.<nl>Another issue could be the laboratory setting, as this could have an affect on brain activity. This is not a very normal situation for participants to be placed in so they may be uncomfortable or more alert as they know they are being studied. This could impact the EEG recordings as it is not a life-like situation so the results may not be generalisable to the whole population.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Overall, the data is valid despite minor methodological issues, which after replication can minimise the effect of individual differences, such as blinking and horizontal eye movement. The data also supports AIH and produced the expected results.", "We\u2019ve got a as WhatsApp group for the <module> essay.

I'm writing this email on behalf of us all in regards to the maintenance of the house.<nl><nl>Firstly, the fridge has been a recurring problem. This is because from day one it has always been difficult to fully close it - partly due to the design of the cupboard door and the fact that the freezer isn\u2019t working properly and as a result the ice builds up and doesn\u2019t allow it to close. This further prevents the fridge from closing properly in addition to the cupboard design door. This ongoing issue has resulted in numerous amounts of food not being kept properly and the unfortunate throwing away of them. We are all experiencing hard times as we attempt to continue living with COVID19, therefore the continuous cycle of buying food and it going off due to a dysfucntional and ineffective fridge makes these times just that much harder.<nl><nl>A contractor was sent out once and the service he provided was not good enough as this is still a very important issue - if not the most important as it directly effects our health and safety.<nl><nl>Another issue in the kitchen is that one of the lower cabinet doors has come off. I believe the inside components have snapped and the repair will require new parts.<nl><nl>The last of the issues in the kitchen is the metal wall section behind the sink. The bottom part of it has opened and essentially began to peel off. This also needs to be fixed because if its allowed to continue peeling the wall behind it will start to get wet from the sink and cause further damage to the property.<nl><nl>In line with maintenance requests, it has also been brought to my attention that the top floor tenant is extremely unhappy with the mattress she is having to use as she says all she can feel is the springs within it. This causes severe joint and shoulder pain - again this is important as it has a direct impact on her health. If this could be replaced it would be most helpful, as we are timely paying tenants who don\u2019t believe this to be an unjust request.<nl><nl>I did contact the <business> property management mobile contact number ending 152, I was directed to report all maintenance issues through property file. However, we were not given access to this platform and so can\u2019t use it. I did reply and let the person know this but I received no reply to that message and the maintenance issues are still outstanding.<nl><nl>I look forward to what solutions you are able to offer and hope to hear from you soon.<nl><nl><part_FN_SN>"]}

{"id": "954670bf-9905-4040-8b67-b8884f0ac6b507137", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["New liberalism was born after a new wave of liberals in the late 19th century to the early 20th century challenged the positions of classical liberals such as Adam Smith and John Locke. Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state.", "Hi <addr2_FN>, <nl><nl>Thanks for your response.

It looks as though the Black lady is- still she\u2019s sat down, and the white lady is stood up, possibly on a laptop. And they look, the Black lady looks surprised, so the white lady could be helping her with some work or something, and she looks shocked and surprised, but they both look happy and smiling.

There\u2019s a picture of two males, one white and one Asian. So there is a white background but they seem to be sat on a black sofa with green, with a green circle pattern on it. The, erm, Asian boy is looking at a white Apple Mac laptop, and the white boy is looking at the Asian boy. Erm, the white boy is wearing a blue floral t-shirt, and the Asian boy is wearing a white crew neck top with a black and red shirt over the top. The laptop is sat on a circular wooden table. Erm, on to the third picture. So there is a Black lady and an Asian male who are both sat down in front of a low glass table. The background is quite interesting; black with, erm, some dot- with some white dots in a circular pattern. So the Black lady ha- is wearing a black top with a black leather jacket, burgundy trousers and brown boots. The Asian boy is wearing a green t-shirt with a grey and black coat. He is holding an open book and he\u2019s wearing beige bottoms with black trainers. They are both looking to the side and they both have a happy expression on their face.

So, I could wake up, go to the bathroom next door, brush my teeth and then come back, get a snack. So, that\u2019s just the start of the day as I'm just, you know, relaxing in my room. Then I\u2019ll go downstairs in about an hour or so, cook some breakfast so eggs, er, bread, beans, sausages and, you know, all the trimmings, bacon as well but I\u2019ve actually kind of reduced on that recently. So, then that\u2019s breakfast. And then usually, I\u2019d set off for the library so around, maybe, eleven, twelvish.

I will scrutinize the works and theories of philosophers around the topic of liberalism over the years such as Thomas Hobbes, John Locke and John Stewart Mill. Looking at theories such as the hedonistic principle, the harm principle and utilitarianism I intend to investigate the first principles of Liberalism. Comparatively I will analyse how the concept of freedom is portrayed or even limited in the Quran. I will then investigate the theory of absolute freedom in liberalism through an Islamic perspective.

It\u2019s just a different sort of, like a whole different country, different culture, different taste, different flavours. So, but, erm, something like dumplings, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have it on a normal day in your house. So, if I had that. And then yeah, you could go to the basic stuff like, er, egg fried rice or chicken fried rice, king prawn fried rice but, yeah, just different culture, I\u2019d say.<new>Oh, my favourite dish to cook. Erm, I mean, I can cook but I wouldn\u2019t say I'm the  <chef>  of the house  <laugh> . So, there\u2019s not much of a, a range to pick from. But erm, I would say, I can make my own roasts quite well, actually, er.<new>Yeah.<new><laugh> , okay. So, erm, it starts by getting your King Edward potatoes in. They usually have a bit of a red tint to them on the outside. So, then you just wash the potatoes, peel them, er, put a bit of salt, a bit of herbs on them, you know, cut them up, er, mix it all together. Then that\u2019s the potatoes done. And a trick my mum taught me is that you can boil the potatoes for a bit before you put them in the oven, which makes them all fluffy and actually cooks them quicker. So yeah, you season it all up and then I actually boil it. Then you put it into the oven and then that\u2019s the potatoes done. Then you get the sausages out of the pack, er, place it on a tray on the foil, put it inside the oven. Then the gravy, it\u2019s, it looks simple but it\u2019s actually kind of hard to make because if you get it too thick, like you\u2019re just eating slob. And if it\u2019s too thin, it\u2019s just water. So, you\u2019ve just got to, as you\u2019re pouring in the hot water, pour in the gra-, the granules at the same time and mix it consistently, otherwise, if you get lumps or it gets all thin, it\u2019s not really going to taste the best. So, whilst you\u2019re doing all of that, the ovens and the sausages are inside. So, erm, really and truly, when you\u2019re making the gravy, you\u2019re practically done. And then, obviously, you\u2019re boiling up all the carrots, the broccolis and then you plate up and you\u2019re done."]}

{"id": "56aeb20b-ab9f-445d-b9cc-908d0d9b2b8804204", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>What is religion? Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961). This definition further criticizes religion as something which individuals turn to out of worry and desperation.<nl>In addition to the functional definitions of religion which can be seen above, there is also the substantive definition of religion which can be investigated. Substantive definitions tend to define religion in terms of its content rather than its function. Here, it is common for the existence of a \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018supernatural being\u2019 to be present when defining religion. This can be seen in Roland Robertsons definition of religion, where he states that \u2018religion refers to the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life\u2019 (Robertson, 1970). Such definitions however, can be seen as problematic to the wider community. This definition of religion by Robertson, clearly necessitates the existence of a god, and rejects any ideas that do not have a \u2018god\u2019 at the centre of their ideology to be classed as religion. This would not allow for beliefs such as Buddhism to be categorised as a religion, due to the fact that it is not based upon the concept of a creator- God (Gethin, 1998). Robertson\u2019s view on religion is supported by Max Weber, who also uses a substantive concept of religion, seeing it as a belief in a divine entity which cannot be explained scientifically (Weber, 2009). In other words, the belief in a god is required for a concept to be deemed as a religion. Ronald Dworkin however, opposes this notion and states that \u2018religion, does not necessarily mean a belief in god\u2019 and \u2018religion is an interpretive concept\u2019 (Dworkin, 2013). Dworkins use of the word \u2018interpretive\u2019, infers that religion can have a different meaning, dependent on the individual. Buddhism has now been linked to the global category of a world religion (McMahan, 2012), causing much debate upon what constitutes religion. This begs the question, who has set the requirements for what can and cannot be defined as a religion? Who has the right to dictate this? As Aldridge states \u2018Defining religion involves an exercise of power\u2019 (Aldridge, 2007).<nl><nl>Religion in International Relations- Post Secularization and Foreign Policy <nl>Often, when analysing religion within the international relations scene it can be deemed an aspect which is hastily overlooked. Religion is rarely included in most major theories of international relations and this can be ascribed to major Western social thinkers rejecting the notion of religion (Fox and Sandler, 2004), as discussed previously. As a particular scholar illustrated , \u2018the role of religion in explaining attitudes toward issues of international relations is somewhat limited\u2019 (Jelen, 1994). However, when further analysing international relations and conflict, it is clear that religion can be seen as a crucial element which should not be disregarded. It has been said that \u2018Domestic conflicts, including religious conflicts are becoming increasingly international issues\u2019 (Fox and Sandler, 2004). This extract from \u2018Bringing religion into International Relations\u2019, further emphasis the vital role that religion can play when assessing international relations. Examples of conflict which involve religion are The Israel Palestine conflict and the Thirty Years war. Here, religion can be key in resolving and understanding the clash, possibly presenting a recourse. <nl>Post secularization, it has been noted that a global resurgence of religion is transforming our understanding of international relations (Thomas, 2005). As there has been an increase in religious actors, it has recently become a vital analytical focus (Haynes,2005). These religious actors can include examples such as foreign policy taking into account religion, as well as transnational factors. The more that religion begins to play a pivotal role in making country decisions, the more clarity there is on what a substantial role religion plays on the international scene. There has previously been a narrative which has pushed the notion that the term \u2018religion\u2019 carries negative connotations and only leads to tension and ferocity, bringing nothing of substance to the international relations division. This adheres to the \u2018Westphalian presumption\u2019, which holds that \u2018religious and cultural pluralism cannot be accommodated in international public life\u2019 (Thomas, 2005). In other words, faith must be conceived as an internal matter to the sovereign state in order to avoid the risk of potential religious wars. This has encouraged using scientific knowledge and clear reasoning as justification for decisions over religion. It is clear that during these strongly secular times, there wasn\u2019t a want to define the term \u2018religion\u2019 from an international perspective. However, as religion began to make a return to the international scene, events such as 911 and Samuel Huntingtons\u2019 famous \u2018The clash of civilizations?\u2019 thesis (Huntington, 2000), only drew more attention to the importance of religion on the international relations front. As there was deemed to be a rise in religious clash and issues, with pivotal events such as 911, the topic of religion had to be assessed on the international scale. <nl>Many would also agree that religion has an important role to play in creating and shaping beliefs, which may in turn influence the formulation of state policy and foreign policy considerations. An instance of this can be seen with President George W. Bush, where he referred to the US having a \u2018calling\u2019 and \u2018mission\u2019 by the \u2018Maker of heaven\u2019 in his speeches on Foreign Policy (Judis, 2005). Not only can it be inferred here that George Bush is attempting to appeal to his majority audience with his \u2018faithful\u2019 language, but his references to God here explain how religion has had a direct impact on the foreign policy choices made. Bush\u2019s choice of language and rhetoric is extremely influential in shaping perspectives of the US citizens opinions on foreign policy. It was found here that there was a clear link between religion and opinion on U.S foreign policy in the Middle East (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). In particular, Evangelical Christians are more supportive of Bush\u2019s Foreign policy on the Iraq war and his foreign policy in general (Pew Research Centre, 2020). In a specific study carried out by Pew Research Centre, even after adjusting for the identity of the respondents groups, the impact of Evangelical beliefs towards foreign policy towards the Middle East remained statistically important (Pew Research Centre, 2020). These results are significant as they provide confirmatory proof that the position of Evangelical affiliation in shaping public opinion on foreign policy is important. It is also fundamental in understanding what a large effect a single religious group can have on how a country is run. The Middle East and President George Bush are a great area of focus due to the Iraq war being a matter which has concerned wide-spread public opinion since 2003 (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). As Boyer stated \u2018For many believers in biblical prophecy, the Bush administration\u2019s go-it-alone foreign policy, hands-off attitude toward the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and proposed war on Iraq, are not simply actions in the national self-interest or an extension of the war on terrorism, but part of an unfolding divine plan\u2019 (Boyer, 2003). This quote highlights how it is recognised that many individuals feel as though these conflicts directly involve religion and god, not only country policy. This infers that individuals will use faith as a major indicator when deciding their stance on subjects such as the Iraq war and foreign policy. On the contrary, research from the Pew Research centre suggests that people feel as though their faith does not define their opinion on the Iraq War (Different Faiths, Different Messages, 2020). Either way, the fact that there is much debate around religion probes several questions on the topic of faith, making it a valid matter when discussing international relations. As religion is increasingly being used for justification as well as indication, it is an important matter to consider on the international scene. \u00a8<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, when looking at definitions of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the context of both Sociology and International relations, it is obvious that there is much debate around what the word entails and its specific effects on society, good or bad. It is clear however, that religion has played a large role in shaping and moulding the current societies that we live in today, as well as the international relations scene, be it secular or not. Although there may be much debate upon whether the consequences of religion are \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 and \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019, the simple fact that decisions have and are being made based upon this, make it a crucial element that must be taken into consideration when looking at both society and international relations. There is no doubt that further research in the field of religion is vital and needed in order for a wider understanding of religion and its impact in both contexts.", "See below <new>Hi <addr1_FN>, <nl><nl> <nl><nl>I hope you are keeping well!

Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}

{"id": "a589dca3-4a4d-40fc-95db-e370cff09b9c03344", "discourse_types": ["essay", "speech_transcription"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>What is religion? Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961). This definition further criticizes religion as something which individuals turn to out of worry and desperation.<nl>In addition to the functional definitions of religion which can be seen above, there is also the substantive definition of religion which can be investigated. Substantive definitions tend to define religion in terms of its content rather than its function. Here, it is common for the existence of a \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018supernatural being\u2019 to be present when defining religion. This can be seen in Roland Robertsons definition of religion, where he states that \u2018religion refers to the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life\u2019 (Robertson, 1970). Such definitions however, can be seen as problematic to the wider community. This definition of religion by Robertson, clearly necessitates the existence of a god, and rejects any ideas that do not have a \u2018god\u2019 at the centre of their ideology to be classed as religion. This would not allow for beliefs such as Buddhism to be categorised as a religion, due to the fact that it is not based upon the concept of a creator- God (Gethin, 1998). Robertson\u2019s view on religion is supported by Max Weber, who also uses a substantive concept of religion, seeing it as a belief in a divine entity which cannot be explained scientifically (Weber, 2009). In other words, the belief in a god is required for a concept to be deemed as a religion. Ronald Dworkin however, opposes this notion and states that \u2018religion, does not necessarily mean a belief in god\u2019 and \u2018religion is an interpretive concept\u2019 (Dworkin, 2013). Dworkins use of the word \u2018interpretive\u2019, infers that religion can have a different meaning, dependent on the individual. Buddhism has now been linked to the global category of a world religion (McMahan, 2012), causing much debate upon what constitutes religion. This begs the question, who has set the requirements for what can and cannot be defined as a religion? Who has the right to dictate this? As Aldridge states \u2018Defining religion involves an exercise of power\u2019 (Aldridge, 2007).<nl><nl>Religion in International Relations- Post Secularization and Foreign Policy <nl>Often, when analysing religion within the international relations scene it can be deemed an aspect which is hastily overlooked. Religion is rarely included in most major theories of international relations and this can be ascribed to major Western social thinkers rejecting the notion of religion (Fox and Sandler, 2004), as discussed previously. As a particular scholar illustrated , \u2018the role of religion in explaining attitudes toward issues of international relations is somewhat limited\u2019 (Jelen, 1994). However, when further analysing international relations and conflict, it is clear that religion can be seen as a crucial element which should not be disregarded. It has been said that \u2018Domestic conflicts, including religious conflicts are becoming increasingly international issues\u2019 (Fox and Sandler, 2004). This extract from \u2018Bringing religion into International Relations\u2019, further emphasis the vital role that religion can play when assessing international relations. Examples of conflict which involve religion are The Israel Palestine conflict and the Thirty Years war. Here, religion can be key in resolving and understanding the clash, possibly presenting a recourse. <nl>Post secularization, it has been noted that a global resurgence of religion is transforming our understanding of international relations (Thomas, 2005). As there has been an increase in religious actors, it has recently become a vital analytical focus (Haynes,2005). These religious actors can include examples such as foreign policy taking into account religion, as well as transnational factors. The more that religion begins to play a pivotal role in making country decisions, the more clarity there is on what a substantial role religion plays on the international scene. There has previously been a narrative which has pushed the notion that the term \u2018religion\u2019 carries negative connotations and only leads to tension and ferocity, bringing nothing of substance to the international relations division. This adheres to the \u2018Westphalian presumption\u2019, which holds that \u2018religious and cultural pluralism cannot be accommodated in international public life\u2019 (Thomas, 2005). In other words, faith must be conceived as an internal matter to the sovereign state in order to avoid the risk of potential religious wars. This has encouraged using scientific knowledge and clear reasoning as justification for decisions over religion. It is clear that during these strongly secular times, there wasn\u2019t a want to define the term \u2018religion\u2019 from an international perspective. However, as religion began to make a return to the international scene, events such as 911 and Samuel Huntingtons\u2019 famous \u2018The clash of civilizations?\u2019 thesis (Huntington, 2000), only drew more attention to the importance of religion on the international relations front. As there was deemed to be a rise in religious clash and issues, with pivotal events such as 911, the topic of religion had to be assessed on the international scale. <nl>Many would also agree that religion has an important role to play in creating and shaping beliefs, which may in turn influence the formulation of state policy and foreign policy considerations. An instance of this can be seen with President George W. Bush, where he referred to the US having a \u2018calling\u2019 and \u2018mission\u2019 by the \u2018Maker of heaven\u2019 in his speeches on Foreign Policy (Judis, 2005). Not only can it be inferred here that George Bush is attempting to appeal to his majority audience with his \u2018faithful\u2019 language, but his references to God here explain how religion has had a direct impact on the foreign policy choices made. Bush\u2019s choice of language and rhetoric is extremely influential in shaping perspectives of the US citizens opinions on foreign policy. It was found here that there was a clear link between religion and opinion on U.S foreign policy in the Middle East (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). In particular, Evangelical Christians are more supportive of Bush\u2019s Foreign policy on the Iraq war and his foreign policy in general (Pew Research Centre, 2020). In a specific study carried out by Pew Research Centre, even after adjusting for the identity of the respondents groups, the impact of Evangelical beliefs towards foreign policy towards the Middle East remained statistically important (Pew Research Centre, 2020). These results are significant as they provide confirmatory proof that the position of Evangelical affiliation in shaping public opinion on foreign policy is important. It is also fundamental in understanding what a large effect a single religious group can have on how a country is run. The Middle East and President George Bush are a great area of focus due to the Iraq war being a matter which has concerned wide-spread public opinion since 2003 (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). As Boyer stated \u2018For many believers in biblical prophecy, the Bush administration\u2019s go-it-alone foreign policy, hands-off attitude toward the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and proposed war on Iraq, are not simply actions in the national self-interest or an extension of the war on terrorism, but part of an unfolding divine plan\u2019 (Boyer, 2003). This quote highlights how it is recognised that many individuals feel as though these conflicts directly involve religion and god, not only country policy. This infers that individuals will use faith as a major indicator when deciding their stance on subjects such as the Iraq war and foreign policy. On the contrary, research from the Pew Research centre suggests that people feel as though their faith does not define their opinion on the Iraq War (Different Faiths, Different Messages, 2020). Either way, the fact that there is much debate around religion probes several questions on the topic of faith, making it a valid matter when discussing international relations. As religion is increasingly being used for justification as well as indication, it is an important matter to consider on the international scene. \u00a8<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, when looking at definitions of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the context of both Sociology and International relations, it is obvious that there is much debate around what the word entails and its specific effects on society, good or bad. It is clear however, that religion has played a large role in shaping and moulding the current societies that we live in today, as well as the international relations scene, be it secular or not. Although there may be much debate upon whether the consequences of religion are \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 and \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019, the simple fact that decisions have and are being made based upon this, make it a crucial element that must be taken into consideration when looking at both society and international relations. There is no doubt that further research in the field of religion is vital and needed in order for a wider understanding of religion and its impact in both contexts.", "So for the first image, erm, there are two ladies against a white background. There is one Black lady with braids, and one white lady with brown to blonde ombr\u00e9 hair. They look like they\u2019re in a work environment, as they\u2019re dressed fairly professionally. It looks as though the Black lady is- still she\u2019s sat down, and the white lady is stood up, possibly on a laptop. And they look, the Black lady looks surprised, so the white lady could be helping her with some work or something, and she looks shocked and surprised, but they both look happy and smiling.

There\u2019s a picture of two males, one white and one Asian. So there is a white background but they seem to be sat on a black sofa with green, with a green circle pattern on it.

So the Black lady ha- is wearing a black top with a black leather jacket, burgundy trousers and brown boots. The Asian boy is wearing a green t-shirt with a grey and black coat. He is holding an open book and he\u2019s wearing beige bottoms with black trainers. They are both looking to the side and they both have a happy expression on their face. You can see someone else\u2019s hands in the picture, to the side that they\u2019re looking.

So number one consists of the lady in the denim jacket sitting down, she\u2019s staring at something and her mouth is wide open. She has quite a surprised, but in a positive way, erm, her facial feature shows that she is looking at something which is surprising. And the other lady, on the right of her, is looking downwards towards something. Erm, also the lady with the black and white stripey top has medium length hair, is quite fair skinned, has dark brown hair going into more of an ombr\u00e9 blonde. Whereas the other lady sat down is, she is a Black lady, with black twists. Also, by the picture, it looks like the lady in the black and white top is showing er, her friend next to her, they look like they know each other. And yeah, they look like they\u2019re friends. They look like they are s- in some sort of maybe school environment. It\u2019s a casual environment, which is seen by the clothes that they are wearing. Another way this picture can also be seen is the lady in the denim jacket is looking, n-not looking at something that the girl in the black and white top is showing her, she\u2019s actually looking at something else, and that she\u2019s surprised by what she\u2019s seen because her mouth is wide open. In the second picture, it looks like erm, there are two boys in this picture. One is of South Asian descent, has short black hair and is wearing a black and red chequered shirt with a white top underneath, and there\u2019s a boy next to him on the, his left. And he\u2019s quite fair skinned, has a black ear piercing, and has short brown hair. He\u2019s wearing a top which consists of black and white flowers with red writing on top, but you can\u2019t read the writing. And the guy in the black and red sweatshirt is staring at a MacBook Air, and, er, looks really interested in what he is reading. Whereas his friend next to him is either staring at him, or there is something that\u2019s distracted him that\u2019s next to the guy in the black and red sweatshirt. From the looks of it, because of how close they are, they look like friends. And they look like university students, or a little bit older. They, yeah, they look around the age of between eighteen to er twenty-two. Yeah. In the background actually there are light green and dark green spots, with a black background, which looks like either a wallpaper or it looks like they\u2019re sitting down on a sofa which has that background. And the table that the MacBook is on is a wooden table with different shades of brown, giving it that timber sort of effect. Yeah. In the third picture, there is a Black female and on her left is a South Asian male. South Asian male has a beard and almost a buzz cut which has grown out. And he is wearing a dark green shirt with a long black coat that has buttons on the side, and also a long collar with beige trousers, dark beige trousers, and he is wearing black trainers. In the background of these two people there is a sort of spiral, almost hypnotising effect, sort of wallpaper. Which is, consists of many small, round, white circles across a black backdrop. The girl is wearing a black top with a black leather jacket, and is holding something in her hand, which I can\u2019t see it. Oh, she\u2019s holding something and it looks like there is also a hand in the picture, next to both of her hands. She\u2019s also wearing dark maroon leggings, with light brown leather boots. There is a table in front of them which has something on the glass table, which consists of either leaflets or pamphlets. And yeah, the male is also holding a book which he\u2019s gone through about, I\u2019d say, fifty per cent of. He looks like he\u2019s in the middle of the book; he looks like he\u2019s about to turn a page. They both are staring at the same thing, it looks like, because their eyes are in the same direction. They are both smiling. Erm, you can tell they\u2019re both quite comfortable with each other because of how close they are sat to each other. It looks like they are almost friends. It also looks like they may be students as well, because that looks like quite a big book. So yeah, number three has, you can tell they\u2019re both looking at something which makes them happy, or is something that is amusing to them. Because neither of them look confused.

So, but, erm, something like dumplings, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have it on a normal day in your house. So, if I had that. And then yeah, you could go to the basic stuff like, er, egg fried rice or chicken fried rice, king prawn fried rice but, yeah, just different culture, I\u2019d say.<new>Oh, my favourite dish to cook. Erm, I mean, I can cook but I wouldn\u2019t say I'm the  <chef>  of the house  <laugh> . So, there\u2019s not much of a, a range to pick from. But erm, I would say, I can make my own roasts quite well, actually, er.<new>Yeah.<new><laugh> , okay. So, erm, it starts by getting your King Edward potatoes in. They usually have a bit of a red tint to them on the outside. So, then you just wash the potatoes, peel them, er, put a bit of salt, a bit of herbs on them, you know, cut them up, er, mix it all together. Then that\u2019s the potatoes done. And a trick my mum taught me is that you can boil the potatoes for a bit before you put them in the oven, which makes them all fluffy and actually cooks them quicker. So yeah, you season it all up and then I actually boil it. Then you put it into the oven and then that\u2019s the potatoes done. Then you get the sausages out of the pack, er, place it on a tray on the foil, put it inside the oven. Then the gravy, it\u2019s, it looks simple but it\u2019s actually kind of hard to make because if you get it too thick, like you\u2019re just eating slob. And if it\u2019s too thin, it\u2019s just water. So, you\u2019ve just got to, as you\u2019re pouring in the hot water, pour in the gra-, the granules at the same time and mix it consistently, otherwise, if you get lumps or it gets all thin, it\u2019s not really going to taste the best. So, whilst you\u2019re doing all of that, the ovens and the sausages are inside. So, erm, really and truly, when you\u2019re making the gravy, you\u2019re practically done. And then, obviously, you\u2019re boiling up all the carrots, the broccolis and then you plate up and you\u2019re done."]}

Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}

The nature of social media aids the ability for societal norms to not only be fueled and accepted across various cultures but also enable this to occur at an accelerated pace. However, the media has been proven to impact self-evaluation in a negative way. For example, there are numerous studies looking at women\u2019s self-evaluation, comparing weight-esteem based on neutral images or ideal images (Brown, Novick, Lord, &amp; Richards, 1992); self-worth based on social comparison (Jones &amp; Buckingham, 2005) etc. Unfortunately, looking at the effects on self-worth in men is minimal. This may be due to the rhetoric that portrays men as emotionless and when any type of emotion is displayed, idioms and phrases like \u2018be a man\u2019 or \u2018stop being a baby\u2019 comes into play. Due to this societal norm, it may make it difficult for men to be able to find appropriate support online and on social media platforms when struggling with the negative impact these sites can have on self worth. It is more acceptable for women to seek help online however, there is less support for men. By researching further into the impacts social media has on men\u2019s self worth, it can enable men to feel more comfortable when facing these issues. The research can aid understanding of this and also result in this topic becoming less taboo, giving a better chance for men to talk freely about their experiences.<nl><nl>I have investigated men\u2019s self worth in the context of social media and my main research question is \u2018How do young men talk about self worth within the context of social media (18-25)?\u2019.

The interview will take place over a \u2018Zoom\u2019 video call, therefore I am able to have a video recording of all my participants' answers. <nl><nl>AnalysisResults<nl><nl>Through annotating my transcript I was able to select prominent themes that were discussed by my participant in the interview. These themes are spoken of throughout the interview and appear multiple times, even in different questions. From my initial question (line 7) I was able to determine that my participant is an avid user of social media, using it for entertainment purposes as well as using various platforms. This ensures that the questions I ask are relevant to my participant and the answers reflect their social media usage. <nl><nl>Key themes that were discussed by my participant include \"the ideal man\", involving image, appearance and social status; also \"alternate reality\", discussing not only the falseness of social media but also the construction of one's image on social media platforms.<nl><nl>The Ideal Man<nl><nl>The idea of \u2018the ideal man\u2019 featured within my participants answers multiple times, with a construction of what they personally believe to be the ideal man. As opposed to referring to what my participant feels they should look like, my participant instead suggests what others \"should be looking for\" (line 174) in a man, for example, the ideal height \"6 foot 4, or over 6 foot\" (line 175),  the ideal body, having \"six packs\" (line 138), adequate facial hair \"beard\" (line 176) etc. This is a very specific portrayal of men, suggesting that this is a common image for men to hold and strive to achieve. Although men do have an idea of what the ideal body type is they are also aware that in general life, this may not always be the case, with my participant stating that \"It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of me. It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of anyone I know.\" (line 162-163) when asked if he felt represented by men on social media. However, despite this acknowledgement, my participant still felt uncomfortable for comparisons between the appearance of men on social media and himself. My participant used the phrase \"I\u2019d prefer just to leave it at that\" (lines 161 and 294) indicating that men do feel uncomfortable about discussing their appearance, which supports the taboo of men expressing self-doubt and lacking self worth and lowered confidence. This would explain why my participant referred to other people he knows whenever talking about personal appearance, in order to make his answer generalised as opposed to solely him as well as deflect the discomfort about the fact that he is not the ideal man by justifying it with the fact that most people do not look like that. This is supported when he says \"I don\u2019t think many men would want to admit, especially among their peers, wouldn\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re not the ideal person.\" (lines 354-355) <nl><nl>In addition to the body image, a man\u2019s social status and financial status also seems to be prevalent when it comes to describing the \u2018ideal man\u2019 with my participant referring to men with \"seven figures\" (line 138), and men who have \"lavish\" (line 81 ) lifestyles. A given example was the actor and influencer \u2018Dan Bilzerian\u2019; well known for \"constantly flaunting a bunch of money\" (line 241) and \"constantly surrounded by money\". (line 242) This was someone who my participant would refer to as a \u2018role model\u2019 for most males. My participant also referred to the fact that \"men can be successful on social media without looking the greatest\" (line 225), due to their social and financial status. This is supported by the evolutionary psychology theory that women will desire men who are able to provide stability, in the forms of shelter, money, food etc. (Li, Li, Chan &amp; Zhang, 2016). This would explain that now in the digital age, men are able to attract attention with their wealth via social media through posting \"lavish\" (line 81) objects. As it is now commonplace for influencers to be posting this type of content, as my participant stated, \"ordinary people might look at that and think \u2018Well, that\u2019s not me\u2019.\"(line  So this becomes the new goals and the new norm. It is evident that the fact that my participant did not relate to these standards, as when asked if he felt represented by these role models and depictions of men he stated \"No. No. No. No I don\u2019t.\" (line 156) Being unable to relate to the norm often results in incongruence between one's actual self and ideal self which may lower self worth. (Rogers, 1959).<nl><nl>My participant states that they have changed themselves in order to conform with these standards, however wished not to elaborate on how he changed. Instead he referred to people that he knew of, talking about there being  \"a lot of men that will spend a bunch of time at the gym to try and achieve the body that every man wants.\" (lines 347-348) This emphasises that the pressures displayed online and on social media affects men enough for them to wish to change their lifestyle in order to relate to these standards. <nl><nl>Alternate Reality<nl><nl>Throughout my participants answers he refers to the fact that social media is \"not a true depiction\" (line 60) , is a \"very, very fake place\" (lines 104, 71, 63), \"is quite a negative place\" (lines 70, 84) , is \"not real\" (line 107) , is \"very unhealthy\" (line 117), has \"bad sides\" (line 123), is \"the furthest thing from real life\" (lines 147-148) etc. This is common in all the answers, and is said in multiple different ways. My participant referred to social media in very negative ways, and suggested it is a \"toxic\" (line 136) place, despite spending around \"5 hours\" (line 15) per day. This is not an uncommon amount of time on social media, however spending this much time surrounded by something that is perceived as negative by my participant, it is unsurprising that his self confidence is impacted. Also, despite this awareness of the fact that not everything is quite what it seems on social media, the standards are still internalised. This suggests that regardless of the reality or the accuracy of the things that one may be exposed to, they are still accepted by people and becomes the societal norm. My participant also refers to the fact that women are more educated about the ways images are distorted online as opposed to enhancements and photoshop for men.  <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl><nl>From my research, it is evident that despite being aware of the falseness and unrealistic standards of social media, it is evident that young men\u2019s self worth is impacted negatively by the content they are exposed to on social media. Despite being adamant that they are aware of the one sidedness of social media, men continue to make comparisons and draw from this to bring into real life situations. This makes it clear that men experience lowered self confidence not only looks wise but also based on their financial status, social status and more materialistic things. My research has also made it clear that men also feel pressure, and more should be done in terms of support for men online. However, regardless of the gender, social media does tend to display only positive events, making it harder for regular people to accept other events and negative things in real life.", "Hi <addr2_FN>, <nl><nl>Thanks for your response.

Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}

Er, the man\u2019s got a beard and, er, he\u2019s smiling quite a bit, with a green top under his black, er, inspector gadget jacket,  <laugh>  some people would say. Erm, he\u2019s wearing some, er, brown khaki trousers \u2013 no, brown trousers, yeah. And er, the lady\u2019s wearing some brown boots with red leggings, I would say. Erm, you can\u2019t really see it too caref- too well, but er, she\u2019s got some earrings I think, that are dangling. So er, yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it. So yeah, I would say they\u2019re, they\u2019re both students as well, because they\u2019ve got a book. And er, I don\u2019t know who the third character in the picture is as we can\u2019t really see, but we can just see one of his hands. But yeah.

Due to contralateral processing, P3 should remain inattentive when shown a stimuli on the left. By using EEG, alpha activity can be recorded when shown a stimuli cued left or cued right. Event markers allow for it to be clear when the participant is shown the stimuli, and the alpha activity was recorded. The results showed that there was a significantly higher in left than right cue condition, and supported the hypothesis.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha activity refers to electrical impulses oscillating at 8-13Hz , this is an alpha wave. These brain waves begin in the cerebral cortex (Moini &amp; Piran, 2020) and occur during periods of inattention, where one is in a restful state, whilst being awake, examples of this is when closing eyes, meditating (Lagopoulos et al., 2009), daydreaming etc.  When the brain begins to focus on stimuli, alpha waves are suppressed. The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007), proposes that high alpha indicates disengagement and inhibition of task irrelevant brain areas. In task relevant brain areas, alpha remains low, supporting that alpha activity is modulated by attention.  <nl><nl>This hypothesis is supported by Magosso et al, 2019, which used a regular setting and a VR (virtual reality) setting to see if the intensity of the task and the levels of attention required affects alpha frequency. The results showed that alpha signals are suppressed when having to give attention to tasks although it seems that when isolated from all external features (when participating in VR) alpha activity becomes greater. This suggests that it is the modulation and diversion of attention which causes changes in alpha frequencies.<nl><nl>Sauseng et al (2005) presented participants with directional cues indicating which hemifield the target stimuli would appear in. The target stimuli consisted of either small or large bars which participants identified and responded with \u2018s\u2019 for small and \u2018l\u2019 for large. Results showed that there was stronger alpha frequency suppression in brain areas contralateral to the targeted hemifield. This is due to visual stimuli being processed contralaterally. 200ms before the stimuli was presented, in active processing areas like the parietal lobe (P3), the alpha range is also lower. This study is supportive of AIM (Klimesch et al, 2007), and is used as the basis for this experiment, as it is a partial replication. In this experiment, the focus will be on the effect of arrow cues, specifically the direction they are facing.<nl><nl>Hypothesis<nl>As AIH states, alpha range activity is present in areas that are uninvolved in active processing and is suppressed in areas that actively process. By directing attention, and cueing the participant to expect the stimuli in a specific region they will begin paying attention. As shown by Sauseng et al (2005), visual stimuli is processed contralaterally resulting in alpha suppression in the other side of the brain. For example, if the stimuli is present in the left visual field it will be processed by the right hemisphere. By using the left parietal cortex (P3) to record alpha activity, it is expected that alpha activity will be greater when a stimulus is shown on the left and for this activity to be suppressed when the stimuli is on the right.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 undergraduate students were participants chosen from an opportunity sample.<nl><nl>Design<nl>This experiment uses a within subjects design. The dependent variable is the alpha range amplitudes (microvolts) on the left hand side of the parietal lobe (P3). The independent variable is the direction of the arrow cue, with two levels, left or right. <nl>Materials<nl>This experiment used a Biopac MP36 to collect data, EEG electrodes, AC Cream, Abrasive paste, PsychoPy to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device and stimuli (see figure 1). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG by opening the Biopac student lab. From the \u2018analog\u2019 tab select Electroencaphagram (EEG)\u2019 \u20180.5-100Hz wnotch\u2019, so the 50Hz band is filtered out. Digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker.. The \u2018calculation\u2019 tab allowed alpha frequency to be recorded. Then select \u2018EEG alpha 8-13Hz\u2019 from the drop down list. The sampling rate was 1000Hz. The participant was then prepared to be attached to the EEG. The electrode sites were abraded with everi cream using a cotton bud, and then AC cream was put on the electrodes. The electrodes are placed using the 1020 system. The active electrode was placed on P3. Participants were then given a cued visual task. A fixation cross was cued at the centre of the screen for 34ms, followed by an arrow indicating where to focus attention, with a 50% chance of it being cued left or right. There was then an interval of 600-800ms followed by a fixation cross for the second time, finally the participant was shown the target stimuli for 50ms, either a large or small white bar against a black background. Participants were then asked to use the keyboard to respond to the stimuli, typing either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. 75% of the trials were valid (the target stimuli was presented in the same hemifield that the arrow cue indicated), and 25% were invalid (the target stimuli was presented in the other hemifield). There were 20 blocks of the four trial types (cue left with a small bar, cue right with a small bar, cue left with a large bar and cue right with a large bar) so in total there were 80 trials.<nl><nl>Results<nl>There were transformations applied to the raw 9-13Hz alpha EEG data. There were eventmarkers received by PsychoPy through the Stimtracker, in order to identify when the stimuli was presented to the participants. The data also was used to specifically analyse from 200ms prior to stimulus onset after the directional arrow cues had been shown. Furthermore, the data was rectified, making negative values positive despite them showing excitatory or inhibitory activity. The samples were also averaged in order to limit the impact that outlying values would have on the data. This data is referred to as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl><nl>Descriptive Statistics<nl><table><nl><nl>Inferential Statistics <nl>The wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T=566, n=38, p=.002).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results of this experiment show that there was a significantly higher level of alpha activity when the stimulus was shown on the left hand side, this fit the original hypothesis. These results are consistent with AIH (Klimesch et al, 2007) as it shows that when participants are given a stimulus in their left hemifield, due to contralateral processing, this is processed by the right part of brain areas. As we were looking at P3, the left side of the parietal lobe, when shown a cue on the left it was processed on the right, meaning the left was task irrelevant and inattentive, resulting in higher alpha activity.<nl><nl>Methodological Problems<nl>Factors which may have confounded data include artefacts, which is when the EEG is contaminated by excess movement. When eye movements take place, the electrical activity could be recorded as brain activity. Eye movements could be blinking or horizontal eye movement, especially when having to look at either side of the screen. Blinking could also pose other issues such as the participant missing the cue. However, it does not seem to be too much of an issue and repetition and more trials would minimise the effects of this.<nl>Another issue could be the laboratory setting, as this could have an affect on brain activity. This is not a very normal situation for participants to be placed in so they may be uncomfortable or more alert as they know they are being studied. This could impact the EEG recordings as it is not a life-like situation so the results may not be generalisable to the whole population.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Overall, the data is valid despite minor methodological issues, which after replication can minimise the effect of individual differences, such as blinking and horizontal eye movement. The data also supports AIH and produced the expected results.", "Erm, my favourite restaurant is, probably,  <restaurant1> \u2019s, just because it\u2019s like, it\u2019s not too expensive and the food, like the food never, I feel like I\u2019ve never had a bad  <restaurant1> \u2019s.

These characteristics can be highlighted as territory (an area with defined borders), external and internal sovereignty where a state must be able to defend its territory and not be too dependent on another power. A state achieves sovereignty when it is recognised by the family of states as the \u2018sole governing authority within its territory and as the legal equal of other states\u2019 (The Modern State, 2020). Furthermore, there has to be legitimacy in which there is recognised rule, examples of this are traditional legitimacy, charismatic legitimacy and rational-legal legitimacy; the legitimacy enhances a state\u2019s sovereignty at a lower cost. The last characteristic is modern bureaucracy, this is required to generate as well as collect revenue. In this essay we will be discussing and critically examining Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, who criticizes the moralistic view of authority. Machiavelli although seen as an evil man, had a large influence on the future of modern civilisation especially in comparison to the artists of his time. <nl><nl>For Machiavelli, moral basis on which to judge the difference between illegitimate and legitimate uses of power does not exist, arguing that this does not add to the actual possession of power \u2013 rather the legitimacy rests upon the threat of coercive force. His beliefs rest in those that the leaders should avoid the common values of justice and mercy in preference to the use of violence and fear, particularly if it is in the best interest such as through gaining and expanding political power. Historians have stated Machiavelli to be the \u2018teacher of evil\u2019 such as Leo Strauss (McShea, 1963). However, Machiavelli has been credited with formulating the \"modern concept of the state\", that is understood in the Weberian sense of a \u2018form of rule possessing a monopoly of coercive authority within a set territorial boundary\u2019 (Nederman, 2019). Machiavelli derived his views from the experience of the Caesura Borgia.  However, Machiavelli did contribute to the way we understand the modern state now as he proposed his own conception of the \"civil principality\" whilst subverting his previous medieval idea of state as regime (Sellers,2015). However, it should be noted that force is not the only weapon to rule the people so his argument can be seen as psychologically weak.<nl><nl>Machiavelli also states that principality can be seen to be governed by a single ruler and is helped by anointed ministers which is the case in many current states seen today. Machiavelli states that the idea of taking over depends on the character of region than the character of the prince, he has the strong belief that the citizens will recollect and fight for their liberty. Although we have grown out of medieval brutality, it can be argued that the modern-day equivalent of killing is to send rivals to jail or allow opponents to lose if there is indecisiveness. An example of this is Brexit, where the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was seen as indecisive and therefore could not gain enough votes in time for the referendum. Another way Machiavelli is modernised is through the idea that leaders will need to make severe decisions, such as through firing a member of the cabinet. An example of this is the Night of Long Knives in 1962 where Macmillan sacked a third of his cabinet. Nevertheless, Machiavelli ignored individualism and had one sided views of human nature which can be viewed as a critical flaw.<nl><nl>For Machiavelli, law is also impossible to follow without the required military as arms are a requirement in order for leaders to establish great frameworks. Although it can be criticised as we do not follow medieval combat, there are still some aspects which apply to the modern state, for instance the concept that an army from your own principality is most beneficial for defending yourself \u2013 and this concept is universally accepted. Machiavelli also made the point that there is conflict of interest which can be seen in the modern state also, for example through the leak of the Panama papers. What is also seen in the modern state is Machiavelli\u2019s view on auxiliary troops being faithful to someone else, for example through the rise of the Taliban, as although it was intended for the Taliban to fight the Soviet Union, they later turned and became the lead terrorist group. In Antonio Negri\u2019s view, Machiavelli belongs to a \u2018political alternative of modern thought grounded on a revolutionary version of constituent power\u2019 (Negri and Maurizia Boscagli, 2009). However, Quentin Skinner and J.G.A Pocock write that we should regard Machiavelli as part of the republican tradition, i.e. as part of the living legacy of Aristotelian philosophy (Roecklein, 2012). Nonetheless, Machiavelli was the first modern thinker to have thought of the State as an independent entity and not recognising any religious organisation exterior to it and The Prince has been a choice of several political leaders such as Louis XIV, Napoleon Bonaparte and Benito Mussolini. <nl><nl>The modern state was \u2018constituted by an abstraction from personal to impersonal rule\u2019 (Mansfield, 1983). With Machiavelli we encounter a challenge to the classical regime which is expressed in his use of stato (his stato is someone\u2019s to acquire), whereas for Aristotle\u2019s regime there is some ordering of the inhabitants of the city. The central theme of Machiavelli\u2019s political ideas is power with absolute state being the end. The state is viewed as superior to all associations and is sovereign as well as autonomous however he also stated that religion cannot influence politics and the church cannot control the state, which is not the case. <nl><nl>Comparing Machiavelli to other theorists allows for us to critically evaluate him further. Plato had the vision of every human being born into a division which was maintained and creating an arrangement for the state in the course of classism whereas Machiavelli proposed with the aim of sovereignty to support the nation in which the leader controls and protects its citizens. Machiavelli\u2019s concept of virt\u00fa highlights the utilitarian needs of the country. For Machiavelli virt\u00fa outweighs virtue in times of need whilst Plato believes a \u2018just ruler must behave the same at all times\u2019 however we have to consider they were writing in different eras, as Plato\u2019s philosophy is based on utopian principles and Machiavelli is viewed as a realist (Abrams, M, 2017). Aristotle divides government into two categories: good and bad with good forms fall aristocracy and under bad fall oligarchy. Aristotle wanted to help society achieve goodness through politics whereas on the other hand Machiavelli sought to achieve the maintenance of power and stability. They have differing views in terms of Aristotle claimed that if an entire state is made to fear their ruler, this would cause unhappiness however Machiavelli suggested that it is better to be feared than loved as it creates balance. However, they are on similar sides when it comes to liberation, as in the Prince it stated such ruler should not dictate the actions of others, but all together Machiavelli was seeking a practical type of politics whilst Aristotle took a rather idealistic approach (Tabone, 2020).  <nl><nl>Hobbes and Machiavelli have fascinating ideas on human nature impacting the state as the common theme is the usage of fear, meaning power needs to be acquired and maintained but we have to remember that Machiavelli\u2019s time period involved the peak of absolutism and hierarchies. Philosophers such a John Locke have directly opposing views on government. Locke\u2019s perception of revolt as a right gave people excessive power compared to the government, this did not exist during the time of Machiavelli. Locke believed in the idea of the government working for the people, however this is directly opposed to Machiavelli\u2019s thought that the ruler should do what it takes to remain in power (Chris Joseph, 2014). Machiavelli recommended that coercion should be used in order to govern whereas Locke favoured a social contract with the concept of dual accountability. Although Machiavelli\u2019s concept of coercion is flawed, he did recognise that rulers could not govern by this alone and advocated for the use of cunning and subterfuge, Locke\u2019s social contract did not contain an element of this. Machiavelli had a pessimistic view of individuals and believed human beings are fundamentally bad whereas Locke was more optimistic. In the modern state it follows Machiavelli\u2019s model more as the rulers in the modern state are comprised of the rich and powerful in society. Mill and Machiavelli also have the same solution to government in freedom of speech, they are both aware that people cannot have a hand in ruling itself. <nl><nl>Political leaders and their followers believed that Machiavellism was a disease infesting the politic body. He is still regarded with a negative reputation, but he still aids us to understand the modern state. Machiavelli promoted the central role of a citizen in preserving institutions which is reflected through the meaning of the Second Amendment in the U.S. Constitution (Bernard, 2009). Among modern believers of Machiavelli, there are Burmese generals such as Web Jiabao, the Former Premier of China and Lord Mandelson (Bernard, 2009). Machiavelli and Pareto agree in terms of this where they say egotism or selfishness as a natural property of the human species (Femia, 2013). According to Machiavellism though, the principle aim of prince is the unification as well as welfare of the state which showed reality of practical politics. He deduced that the internal unity and powerful government were the essential of any state by observing the affairs of the interstate rivalries. The sole aim of the prince is also to increase power in ways such as to be an expert in managing and organising a war- power is seen as the only reason of the state. <nl><nl>To conclude Machiavelli contributes to the \u2018comprehension of constituent power as a living force within social order\u2019 (Lucchese, 2016). He developed a revolutionary position, suggesting that political conflict is not a destabilising factor, but rather the grounding force of free republics. His concepts and ideas are often misunderstood as he displayed rare intellect to become a partisan in an age where absolute monarchy held control (Mathur, 1991). All together Machiavelli was the first thinker who justified secular state and the first advocate for autonomy for the state. He unfairly became associated with evil through his critical work written about The Prince, and although it did not get translated until almost a hundred years later the negative view about Machiavelli had already been established into Elizabethan England. All together he communicated priority to the state and put it above morality and religion as it is the highest form of social organisation and most essential to promote human welfare, and this is seen clearly in the modern state. Machiavelli\u2019s Prince dealt exclusively with the interests of a single person of power that focuses on only the leader\u2019s welfare in mind whereas the theories of Plato, Aristotle, Locke and Mill dealt with the welfare of society. However, in the modern state there Machiavelli did consider that the Prince needed to maintain good relations with the people which is what we observe. It can be agreed the way that Machiavelli talks about the state as Machiavelli was a realist.", "The first picture is of two women. One is sat down wearing a denim jacket, and she has twists in her hair. The other woman is wearing a black and white stripey top, dark blue jeans and a belt. So number one consists of the lady in the denim jacket sitting down, she\u2019s staring at something and her mouth is wide open. She has quite a surprised, but in a positive way, erm, her facial feature shows that she is looking at something which is surprising. And the other lady, on the right of her, is looking downwards towards something. Erm, also the lady with the black and white stripey top has medium length hair, is quite fair skinned, has dark brown hair going into more of an ombr\u00e9 blonde. Whereas the other lady sat down is, she is a Black lady, with black twists. Also, by the picture, it looks like the lady in the black and white top is showing er, her friend next to her, they look like they know each other. And yeah, they look like they\u2019re friends. They look like they are s- in some sort of maybe school environment. It\u2019s a casual environment, which is seen by the clothes that they are wearing. Another way this picture can also be seen is the lady in the denim jacket is looking, n-not looking at something that the girl in the black and white top is showing her, she\u2019s actually looking at something else, and that she\u2019s surprised by what she\u2019s seen because her mouth is wide open. In the second picture, it looks like erm, there are two boys in this picture. One is of South Asian descent, has short black hair and is wearing a black and red chequered shirt with a white top underneath, and there\u2019s a boy next to him on the, his left. And he\u2019s quite fair skinned, has a black ear piercing, and has short brown hair. He\u2019s wearing a top which consists of black and white flowers with red writing on top, but you can\u2019t read the writing. And the guy in the black and red sweatshirt is staring at a MacBook Air, and, er, looks really interested in what he is reading. Whereas his friend next to him is either staring at him, or there is something that\u2019s distracted him that\u2019s next to the guy in the black and red sweatshirt. From the looks of it, because of how close they are, they look like friends. And they look like university students, or a little bit older. They, yeah, they look around the age of between eighteen to er twenty-two. Yeah. In the background actually there are light green and dark green spots, with a black background, which looks like either a wallpaper or it looks like they\u2019re sitting down on a sofa which has that background. And the table that the MacBook is on is a wooden table with different shades of brown, giving it that timber sort of effect. Yeah. In the third picture, there is a Black female and on her left is a South Asian male. South Asian male has a beard and almost a buzz cut which has grown out. And he is wearing a dark green shirt with a long black coat that has buttons on the side, and also a long collar with beige trousers, dark beige trousers, and he is wearing black trainers. In the background of these two people there is a sort of spiral, almost hypnotising effect, sort of wallpaper. Which is, consists of many small, round, white circles across a black backdrop. The girl is wearing a black top with a black leather jacket, and is holding something in her hand, which I can\u2019t see it. Oh, she\u2019s holding something and it looks like there is also a hand in the picture, next to both of her hands. She\u2019s also wearing dark maroon leggings, with light brown leather boots. There is a table in front of them which has something on the glass table, which consists of either leaflets or pamphlets. And yeah, the male is also holding a book which he\u2019s gone through about, I\u2019d say, fifty per cent of. He looks like he\u2019s in the middle of the book; he looks like he\u2019s about to turn a page. They both are staring at the same thing, it looks like, because their eyes are in the same direction. They are both smiling. Erm, you can tell they\u2019re both quite comfortable with each other because of how close they are sat to each other. It looks like they are almost friends. It also looks like they may be students as well, because that looks like quite a big book. So yeah, number three has, you can tell they\u2019re both looking at something which makes them happy, or is something that is amusing to them. Because neither of them look confused. I-I think they both look eager to know more."]}

The nature of social media aids the ability for societal norms to not only be fueled and accepted across various cultures but also enable this to occur at an accelerated pace. However, the media has been proven to impact self-evaluation in a negative way. For example, there are numerous studies looking at women\u2019s self-evaluation, comparing weight-esteem based on neutral images or ideal images (Brown, Novick, Lord, &amp; Richards, 1992); self-worth based on social comparison (Jones &amp; Buckingham, 2005) etc. Unfortunately, looking at the effects on self-worth in men is minimal. This may be due to the rhetoric that portrays men as emotionless and when any type of emotion is displayed, idioms and phrases like \u2018be a man\u2019 or \u2018stop being a baby\u2019 comes into play. Due to this societal norm, it may make it difficult for men to be able to find appropriate support online and on social media platforms when struggling with the negative impact these sites can have on self worth. It is more acceptable for women to seek help online however, there is less support for men. By researching further into the impacts social media has on men\u2019s self worth, it can enable men to feel more comfortable when facing these issues. The research can aid understanding of this and also result in this topic becoming less taboo, giving a better chance for men to talk freely about their experiences.<nl><nl>I have investigated men\u2019s self worth in the context of social media and my main research question is \u2018How do young men talk about self worth within the context of social media (18-25)?\u2019. My method of analysis is discourse analysis as it allows for in-depth analysis into not only my participant\u2019s language use to construct ideas but also intonation. The interview will take place over a \u2018Zoom\u2019 video call, therefore I am able to have a video recording of all my participants' answers. <nl><nl>AnalysisResults<nl><nl>Through annotating my transcript I was able to select prominent themes that were discussed by my participant in the interview. These themes are spoken of throughout the interview and appear multiple times, even in different questions. From my initial question (line 7) I was able to determine that my participant is an avid user of social media, using it for entertainment purposes as well as using various platforms. This ensures that the questions I ask are relevant to my participant and the answers reflect their social media usage. <nl><nl>Key themes that were discussed by my participant include \"the ideal man\", involving image, appearance and social status; also \"alternate reality\", discussing not only the falseness of social media but also the construction of one's image on social media platforms.<nl><nl>The Ideal Man<nl><nl>The idea of \u2018the ideal man\u2019 featured within my participants answers multiple times, with a construction of what they personally believe to be the ideal man. As opposed to referring to what my participant feels they should look like, my participant instead suggests what others \"should be looking for\" (line 174) in a man, for example, the ideal height \"6 foot 4, or over 6 foot\" (line 175),  the ideal body, having \"six packs\" (line 138), adequate facial hair \"beard\" (line 176) etc. This is a very specific portrayal of men, suggesting that this is a common image for men to hold and strive to achieve. Although men do have an idea of what the ideal body type is they are also aware that in general life, this may not always be the case, with my participant stating that \"It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of me. It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of anyone I know.\" (line 162-163) when asked if he felt represented by men on social media. However, despite this acknowledgement, my participant still felt uncomfortable for comparisons between the appearance of men on social media and himself. My participant used the phrase \"I\u2019d prefer just to leave it at that\" (lines 161 and 294) indicating that men do feel uncomfortable about discussing their appearance, which supports the taboo of men expressing self-doubt and lacking self worth and lowered confidence. This would explain why my participant referred to other people he knows whenever talking about personal appearance, in order to make his answer generalised as opposed to solely him as well as deflect the discomfort about the fact that he is not the ideal man by justifying it with the fact that most people do not look like that. This is supported when he says \"I don\u2019t think many men would want to admit, especially among their peers, wouldn\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re not the ideal person.\" (lines 354-355) <nl><nl>In addition to the body image, a man\u2019s social status and financial status also seems to be prevalent when it comes to describing the \u2018ideal man\u2019 with my participant referring to men with \"seven figures\" (line 138), and men who have \"lavish\" (line 81 ) lifestyles. A given example was the actor and influencer \u2018Dan Bilzerian\u2019; well known for \"constantly flaunting a bunch of money\" (line 241) and \"constantly surrounded by money\". (line 242) This was someone who my participant would refer to as a \u2018role model\u2019 for most males. My participant also referred to the fact that \"men can be successful on social media without looking the greatest\" (line 225), due to their social and financial status. This is supported by the evolutionary psychology theory that women will desire men who are able to provide stability, in the forms of shelter, money, food etc. (Li, Li, Chan &amp; Zhang, 2016). This would explain that now in the digital age, men are able to attract attention with their wealth via social media through posting \"lavish\" (line 81) objects. As it is now commonplace for influencers to be posting this type of content, as my participant stated, \"ordinary people might look at that and think \u2018Well, that\u2019s not me\u2019.\"(line  So this becomes the new goals and the new norm. It is evident that the fact that my participant did not relate to these standards, as when asked if he felt represented by these role models and depictions of men he stated \"No. No. No. No I don\u2019t.\" (line 156) Being unable to relate to the norm often results in incongruence between one's actual self and ideal self which may lower self worth. (Rogers, 1959).<nl><nl>My participant states that they have changed themselves in order to conform with these standards, however wished not to elaborate on how he changed. Instead he referred to people that he knew of, talking about there being  \"a lot of men that will spend a bunch of time at the gym to try and achieve the body that every man wants.\" (lines 347-348) This emphasises that the pressures displayed online and on social media affects men enough for them to wish to change their lifestyle in order to relate to these standards. <nl><nl>Alternate Reality<nl><nl>Throughout my participants answers he refers to the fact that social media is \"not a true depiction\" (line 60) , is a \"very, very fake place\" (lines 104, 71, 63), \"is quite a negative place\" (lines 70, 84) , is \"not real\" (line 107) , is \"very unhealthy\" (line 117), has \"bad sides\" (line 123), is \"the furthest thing from real life\" (lines 147-148) etc. This is common in all the answers, and is said in multiple different ways. My participant referred to social media in very negative ways, and suggested it is a \"toxic\" (line 136) place, despite spending around \"5 hours\" (line 15) per day. This is not an uncommon amount of time on social media, however spending this much time surrounded by something that is perceived as negative by my participant, it is unsurprising that his self confidence is impacted. Also, despite this awareness of the fact that not everything is quite what it seems on social media, the standards are still internalised. This suggests that regardless of the reality or the accuracy of the things that one may be exposed to, they are still accepted by people and becomes the societal norm. My participant also refers to the fact that women are more educated about the ways images are distorted online as opposed to enhancements and photoshop for men.  <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl><nl>From my research, it is evident that despite being aware of the falseness and unrealistic standards of social media, it is evident that young men\u2019s self worth is impacted negatively by the content they are exposed to on social media. Despite being adamant that they are aware of the one sidedness of social media, men continue to make comparisons and draw from this to bring into real life situations. This makes it clear that men experience lowered self confidence not only looks wise but also based on their financial status, social status and more materialistic things. My research has also made it clear that men also feel pressure, and more should be done in terms of support for men online. However, regardless of the gender, social media does tend to display only positive events, making it harder for regular people to accept other events and negative things in real life.", "Erm, I really like Mexican food just because like I feel like when you like go out to eat, as well, like especially when you go out to eat Mexican feed, I feel like it\u2019s just such a nice like, it\u2019s like a nice atmosphere, the food\u2019s really good, like it\u2019s nice and warm and it\u2019s quite like fulfilling, like you always feel full after eating Mexican food, like, especially me, like I feel like when I\u2019ve eaten, like, a like a burrito or like fajitas or whatever, I\u2019m always like really full.

Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}

{"id": "18da75f4-e11f-4668-b0c4-fa6d37c6d645", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl><nl>With the average person in the UK spending 110 minutes on social media, it is inevitable that content displayed across these platforms impact and influence societal norms. The nature of social media aids the ability for societal norms to not only be fueled and accepted across various cultures but also enable this to occur at an accelerated pace. However, the media has been proven to impact self-evaluation in a negative way. For example, there are numerous studies looking at women\u2019s self-evaluation, comparing weight-esteem based on neutral images or ideal images (Brown, Novick, Lord, &amp; Richards, 1992); self-worth based on social comparison (Jones &amp; Buckingham, 2005) etc. Unfortunately, looking at the effects on self-worth in men is minimal. This may be due to the rhetoric that portrays men as emotionless and when any type of emotion is displayed, idioms and phrases like \u2018be a man\u2019 or \u2018stop being a baby\u2019 comes into play. Due to this societal norm, it may make it difficult for men to be able to find appropriate support online and on social media platforms when struggling with the negative impact these sites can have on self worth. It is more acceptable for women to seek help online however, there is less support for men. By researching further into the impacts social media has on men\u2019s self worth, it can enable men to feel more comfortable when facing these issues. The research can aid understanding of this and also result in this topic becoming less taboo, giving a better chance for men to talk freely about their experiences.<nl><nl>I have investigated men\u2019s self worth in the context of social media and my main research question is \u2018How do young men talk about self worth within the context of social media (18-25)?\u2019. My method of analysis is discourse analysis as it allows for in-depth analysis into not only my participant\u2019s language use to construct ideas but also intonation. The interview will take place over a \u2018Zoom\u2019 video call, therefore I am able to have a video recording of all my participants' answers. <nl><nl>AnalysisResults<nl><nl>Through annotating my transcript I was able to select prominent themes that were discussed by my participant in the interview. These themes are spoken of throughout the interview and appear multiple times, even in different questions. From my initial question (line 7) I was able to determine that my participant is an avid user of social media, using it for entertainment purposes as well as using various platforms. This ensures that the questions I ask are relevant to my participant and the answers reflect their social media usage. <nl><nl>Key themes that were discussed by my participant include \"the ideal man\", involving image, appearance and social status; also \"alternate reality\", discussing not only the falseness of social media but also the construction of one's image on social media platforms.<nl><nl>The Ideal Man<nl><nl>The idea of \u2018the ideal man\u2019 featured within my participants answers multiple times, with a construction of what they personally believe to be the ideal man. As opposed to referring to what my participant feels they should look like, my participant instead suggests what others \"should be looking for\" (line 174) in a man, for example, the ideal height \"6 foot 4, or over 6 foot\" (line 175),  the ideal body, having \"six packs\" (line 138), adequate facial hair \"beard\" (line 176) etc. This is a very specific portrayal of men, suggesting that this is a common image for men to hold and strive to achieve. Although men do have an idea of what the ideal body type is they are also aware that in general life, this may not always be the case, with my participant stating that \"It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of me. It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of anyone I know.\" (line 162-163) when asked if he felt represented by men on social media. However, despite this acknowledgement, my participant still felt uncomfortable for comparisons between the appearance of men on social media and himself. My participant used the phrase \"I\u2019d prefer just to leave it at that\" (lines 161 and 294) indicating that men do feel uncomfortable about discussing their appearance, which supports the taboo of men expressing self-doubt and lacking self worth and lowered confidence. This would explain why my participant referred to other people he knows whenever talking about personal appearance, in order to make his answer generalised as opposed to solely him as well as deflect the discomfort about the fact that he is not the ideal man by justifying it with the fact that most people do not look like that. This is supported when he says \"I don\u2019t think many men would want to admit, especially among their peers, wouldn\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re not the ideal person.\" (lines 354-355) <nl><nl>In addition to the body image, a man\u2019s social status and financial status also seems to be prevalent when it comes to describing the \u2018ideal man\u2019 with my participant referring to men with \"seven figures\" (line 138), and men who have \"lavish\" (line 81 ) lifestyles. A given example was the actor and influencer \u2018Dan Bilzerian\u2019; well known for \"constantly flaunting a bunch of money\" (line 241) and \"constantly surrounded by money\". (line 242) This was someone who my participant would refer to as a \u2018role model\u2019 for most males. My participant also referred to the fact that \"men can be successful on social media without looking the greatest\" (line 225), due to their social and financial status. This is supported by the evolutionary psychology theory that women will desire men who are able to provide stability, in the forms of shelter, money, food etc. (Li, Li, Chan &amp; Zhang, 2016). This would explain that now in the digital age, men are able to attract attention with their wealth via social media through posting \"lavish\" (line 81) objects. As it is now commonplace for influencers to be posting this type of content, as my participant stated, \"ordinary people might look at that and think \u2018Well, that\u2019s not me\u2019.\"(line  So this becomes the new goals and the new norm. It is evident that the fact that my participant did not relate to these standards, as when asked if he felt represented by these role models and depictions of men he stated \"No. No. No. No I don\u2019t.\" (line 156) Being unable to relate to the norm often results in incongruence between one's actual self and ideal self which may lower self worth. (Rogers, 1959).<nl><nl>My participant states that they have changed themselves in order to conform with these standards, however wished not to elaborate on how he changed. Instead he referred to people that he knew of, talking about there being  \"a lot of men that will spend a bunch of time at the gym to try and achieve the body that every man wants.\" (lines 347-348) This emphasises that the pressures displayed online and on social media affects men enough for them to wish to change their lifestyle in order to relate to these standards. <nl><nl>Alternate Reality<nl><nl>Throughout my participants answers he refers to the fact that social media is \"not a true depiction\" (line 60) , is a \"very, very fake place\" (lines 104, 71, 63), \"is quite a negative place\" (lines 70, 84) , is \"not real\" (line 107) , is \"very unhealthy\" (line 117), has \"bad sides\" (line 123), is \"the furthest thing from real life\" (lines 147-148) etc. This is common in all the answers, and is said in multiple different ways. My participant referred to social media in very negative ways, and suggested it is a \"toxic\" (line 136) place, despite spending around \"5 hours\" (line 15) per day. This is not an uncommon amount of time on social media, however spending this much time surrounded by something that is perceived as negative by my participant, it is unsurprising that his self confidence is impacted. Also, despite this awareness of the fact that not everything is quite what it seems on social media, the standards are still internalised. This suggests that regardless of the reality or the accuracy of the things that one may be exposed to, they are still accepted by people and becomes the societal norm. My participant also refers to the fact that women are more educated about the ways images are distorted online as opposed to enhancements and photoshop for men.  <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl><nl>From my research, it is evident that despite being aware of the falseness and unrealistic standards of social media, it is evident that young men\u2019s self worth is impacted negatively by the content they are exposed to on social media. Despite being adamant that they are aware of the one sidedness of social media, men continue to make comparisons and draw from this to bring into real life situations. This makes it clear that men experience lowered self confidence not only looks wise but also based on their financial status, social status and more materialistic things. My research has also made it clear that men also feel pressure, and more should be done in terms of support for men online. However, regardless of the gender, social media does tend to display only positive events, making it harder for regular people to accept other events and negative things in real life.", "Erm, mm.  <misc> , what is a food I\u2019ve never tried.

And they both seem happy because they\u2019re smiling.", "New liberalism was born after a new wave of liberals in the late 19th century to the early 20th century challenged the positions of classical liberals such as Adam Smith and John Locke. Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}

I don\u2019t even think I\u2019ve tried shrimp.

But right now, there\u2019s not many places I can go to anyway to try it. But yeah. Or lobster! Lobster! I haven\u2019t tried lobster either, actually. Crab, lobster and shrimp, those, those are the three foods that I have never tried but as soon as lock-lockdown is over, I want,  <restaurant3> , it\u2019s meant to be amazing, in  <city1> .

So, I love it. I think people are not open enough to the idea of it so whenever like I make a new friend and I\u2019m like, \"By the way, we can\u2019t really eat meat in my house,\" they\u2019re always like, \"What?\" And there are so many alternatives that are not spoken about. I wish I could go vegan. I, w-, I genuinely wish I had to the willpower. I think I did try once but there are just not many alternatives that taste the same as cheese. But when it comes to like dairy free chocolate and stuff like, we\u2019re trying. I know my sister\u2019s new year\u2019s resolution is to go vegan for the year. So, I\u2019m the only one my hou-, my dad and I are the only people in the household that eat meat. So, my mum and my sister\u2019s vegetarian. So, it just mean my whole life I have not eaten meat. So, I, I c-, I could go without eating meat in my whole life one hundred percent. It\u2019s just I think in terms of when I was younger, I didn\u2019t like the food that my mum gave me, if that makes sense. Sometimes when you eat too many vegetables, you\u2019re like, it make you ki-, it makes you sick and then you realise you\u2019re not getting the nutrients you need. So, that\u2019s the only reason why I switched to eating meat. But apart from that, I\u2019m a hundred percent vouch  <unintelligible> . I think even at Nando\u2019s now, to this day, I will still get a beanie burger, like I wo-, I won\u2019t get the chicken option just because,  <misc> , I don\u2019t know what that burger tastes like and I would, I don\u2019t even want to eat meat. But then again, when you have like a really nice meat option, I\u2019m bound to choose the meat option. But yeah, I think, I would love to go completely vegetarian. And right now, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen, you know, like Beyond Burger and stuff like, new, new brands that have come up, I\u2019m a big fan of Beyond Burger or Quorn, I eat it all. So, the, the, the, recently, they\u2019ve started, there\u2019s more brands as well, isn\u2019t there? So, recently they\u2019re getting there but, yeah, I completely vouch for it. I think one day... I also think going vegan is extremely expensive like we were looking at, erm, alternatives. So, I don\u2019t drink milk, I only drink soya milk. And although, actually, it\u2019s gotten a lot cheaper, other vegan alternatives are just, they\u2019re so expensive. I think, and it\u2019s, er, living in a house with your parents, I think unle-, until I move out and I can like, I\u2019m the one shopping for myself, I think it\u2019s not worth it. I think right now I\u2019ll stick to like food that we do eat now but yeah, I\u2019m quite happy being a vegetarian, like  <unintelligible> . The, ger-, the weird thing, actually, you know the first lockdown, it was from March until about August, I think and some restaurants and stuff opened. I, my grandparents were around and they\u2019re from India, but I didn\u2019t eat any meat from March to August. And when I went out for the first time, I ate a lot of meat. My body ended up rejecting all of it. So, I felt s-sick and it, I know it was so bad. I had  <unintelligible> , I was throwing up everywhere, I couldn\u2019t move, like I had to crawl down the stairs and like in tears, like  <unintelligible> , just so I could like  <unintelligible>  scream to get my parents\u2019 attention. Yeah, my body rejected it all. So, like after that, my parents were like, \"Okay, small amount of meat and do it slowly.\" And ever since then, I get really scared that if I have  <unintelligible> . That\u2019s why I think right now  <unintelligible>  open, I try and eat meat maybe once a week so my body doesn\u2019t get to what it did last year because yeah, oh, that was awful.

Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961). This definition further criticizes religion as something which individuals turn to out of worry and desperation.<nl>In addition to the functional definitions of religion which can be seen above, there is also the substantive definition of religion which can be investigated. Substantive definitions tend to define religion in terms of its content rather than its function. Here, it is common for the existence of a \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018supernatural being\u2019 to be present when defining religion. This can be seen in Roland Robertsons definition of religion, where he states that \u2018religion refers to the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life\u2019 (Robertson, 1970). Such definitions however, can be seen as problematic to the wider community. This definition of religion by Robertson, clearly necessitates the existence of a god, and rejects any ideas that do not have a \u2018god\u2019 at the centre of their ideology to be classed as religion. This would not allow for beliefs such as Buddhism to be categorised as a religion, due to the fact that it is not based upon the concept of a creator- God (Gethin, 1998). Robertson\u2019s view on religion is supported by Max Weber, who also uses a substantive concept of religion, seeing it as a belief in a divine entity which cannot be explained scientifically (Weber, 2009). In other words, the belief in a god is required for a concept to be deemed as a religion. Ronald Dworkin however, opposes this notion and states that \u2018religion, does not necessarily mean a belief in god\u2019 and \u2018religion is an interpretive concept\u2019 (Dworkin, 2013). Dworkins use of the word \u2018interpretive\u2019, infers that religion can have a different meaning, dependent on the individual. Buddhism has now been linked to the global category of a world religion (McMahan, 2012), causing much debate upon what constitutes religion. This begs the question, who has set the requirements for what can and cannot be defined as a religion? Who has the right to dictate this? As Aldridge states \u2018Defining religion involves an exercise of power\u2019 (Aldridge, 2007).<nl><nl>Religion in International Relations- Post Secularization and Foreign Policy <nl>Often, when analysing religion within the international relations scene it can be deemed an aspect which is hastily overlooked. Religion is rarely included in most major theories of international relations and this can be ascribed to major Western social thinkers rejecting the notion of religion (Fox and Sandler, 2004), as discussed previously. As a particular scholar illustrated , \u2018the role of religion in explaining attitudes toward issues of international relations is somewhat limited\u2019 (Jelen, 1994). However, when further analysing international relations and conflict, it is clear that religion can be seen as a crucial element which should not be disregarded. It has been said that \u2018Domestic conflicts, including religious conflicts are becoming increasingly international issues\u2019 (Fox and Sandler, 2004). This extract from \u2018Bringing religion into International Relations\u2019, further emphasis the vital role that religion can play when assessing international relations. Examples of conflict which involve religion are The Israel Palestine conflict and the Thirty Years war. Here, religion can be key in resolving and understanding the clash, possibly presenting a recourse. <nl>Post secularization, it has been noted that a global resurgence of religion is transforming our understanding of international relations (Thomas, 2005). As there has been an increase in religious actors, it has recently become a vital analytical focus (Haynes,2005). These religious actors can include examples such as foreign policy taking into account religion, as well as transnational factors. The more that religion begins to play a pivotal role in making country decisions, the more clarity there is on what a substantial role religion plays on the international scene. There has previously been a narrative which has pushed the notion that the term \u2018religion\u2019 carries negative connotations and only leads to tension and ferocity, bringing nothing of substance to the international relations division. This adheres to the \u2018Westphalian presumption\u2019, which holds that \u2018religious and cultural pluralism cannot be accommodated in international public life\u2019 (Thomas, 2005). In other words, faith must be conceived as an internal matter to the sovereign state in order to avoid the risk of potential religious wars. This has encouraged using scientific knowledge and clear reasoning as justification for decisions over religion. It is clear that during these strongly secular times, there wasn\u2019t a want to define the term \u2018religion\u2019 from an international perspective. However, as religion began to make a return to the international scene, events such as 911 and Samuel Huntingtons\u2019 famous \u2018The clash of civilizations?\u2019 thesis (Huntington, 2000), only drew more attention to the importance of religion on the international relations front. As there was deemed to be a rise in religious clash and issues, with pivotal events such as 911, the topic of religion had to be assessed on the international scale. <nl>Many would also agree that religion has an important role to play in creating and shaping beliefs, which may in turn influence the formulation of state policy and foreign policy considerations. An instance of this can be seen with President George W. Bush, where he referred to the US having a \u2018calling\u2019 and \u2018mission\u2019 by the \u2018Maker of heaven\u2019 in his speeches on Foreign Policy (Judis, 2005). Not only can it be inferred here that George Bush is attempting to appeal to his majority audience with his \u2018faithful\u2019 language, but his references to God here explain how religion has had a direct impact on the foreign policy choices made. Bush\u2019s choice of language and rhetoric is extremely influential in shaping perspectives of the US citizens opinions on foreign policy. It was found here that there was a clear link between religion and opinion on U.S foreign policy in the Middle East (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). In particular, Evangelical Christians are more supportive of Bush\u2019s Foreign policy on the Iraq war and his foreign policy in general (Pew Research Centre, 2020). In a specific study carried out by Pew Research Centre, even after adjusting for the identity of the respondents groups, the impact of Evangelical beliefs towards foreign policy towards the Middle East remained statistically important (Pew Research Centre, 2020). These results are significant as they provide confirmatory proof that the position of Evangelical affiliation in shaping public opinion on foreign policy is important. It is also fundamental in understanding what a large effect a single religious group can have on how a country is run. The Middle East and President George Bush are a great area of focus due to the Iraq war being a matter which has concerned wide-spread public opinion since 2003 (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). As Boyer stated \u2018For many believers in biblical prophecy, the Bush administration\u2019s go-it-alone foreign policy, hands-off attitude toward the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and proposed war on Iraq, are not simply actions in the national self-interest or an extension of the war on terrorism, but part of an unfolding divine plan\u2019 (Boyer, 2003). This quote highlights how it is recognised that many individuals feel as though these conflicts directly involve religion and god, not only country policy. This infers that individuals will use faith as a major indicator when deciding their stance on subjects such as the Iraq war and foreign policy. On the contrary, research from the Pew Research centre suggests that people feel as though their faith does not define their opinion on the Iraq War (Different Faiths, Different Messages, 2020). Either way, the fact that there is much debate around religion probes several questions on the topic of faith, making it a valid matter when discussing international relations. As religion is increasingly being used for justification as well as indication, it is an important matter to consider on the international scene. \u00a8<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, when looking at definitions of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the context of both Sociology and International relations, it is obvious that there is much debate around what the word entails and its specific effects on society, good or bad. It is clear however, that religion has played a large role in shaping and moulding the current societies that we live in today, as well as the international relations scene, be it secular or not.

There is no doubt that further research in the field of religion is vital and needed in order for a wider understanding of religion and its impact in both contexts.", "So in the image one there\u2019s er, two people.

Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961).

So, I usually have, er, Maryland cookies or some type of random sweets or Twix or some type of candy or something and, er, usually with a Fanta on the side of it. So, I could wake up, go to the bathroom next door, brush my teeth and then come back, get a snack. So, that\u2019s just the start of the day as I'm just, you know, relaxing in my room. Then I\u2019ll go downstairs in about an hour or so, cook some breakfast so eggs, er, bread, beans, sausages and, you know, all the trimmings, bacon as well but I\u2019ve actually kind of reduced on that recently. So, then that\u2019s breakfast. And then usually, I\u2019d set off for the library so around, maybe, eleven, twelvish. And then, er, on the way to the library, I\u2019ll probably pick up a few things from  <supermarket1>  so, maybe, a meal deal and a few fruits and drinks and whatever. And then pretty much from midday till about five, maybe, I would have just had the meal deal and then I\u2019ll make my way home. And then when I get home, a cheeky little spaghetti bolognaise to start the night off. And then yeah, it just depends, really, when I sleep when I have my next meal but really and truly, it\u2019s probably another sort of snack, yeah. <new>In terms of, er, which one do I like the most or which one is most beneficial to me?<new>Oh. Before like, erm, I\u2019ve always liked breakfast, it\u2019s always been my, it\u2019s always been my favourite meal of the day, \u2018cause I, I, I learnt how to cook, erm, I learnt how to cook it quite early as well. I used to make eggs, the, the bread, the, warm up the beans, you know, I, I liked cooking breakfast.

Erm, my favourite restaurant, I would say, is  <restaurant1>  and my go to dish from there would be ebi katsu and, er, the chicken curry with the rice. So, the katsu\u2019s actually, literally just fried prawns. So, er, it\u2019s got a nice, a nice coating on the outside and on the inside, when you bit into it\u2019s quite flavourful. Then, er, the actual chicken curry is just rice underneath it all and it\u2019s covered by quite a few vegetables, a few sauces and the actual chicken, you know, mixed in a curry sauce.

And you eat it with a sort of, erm, soup. So, you literally put it in the middle of the bowl and then you pour the soup around it and usually, depending on the type of soup it is, it might have different meats or fishes. So, you could have a fish soup or a meat soup. I usually prefer the, the meat soups. So, erm, you could have a meat soup one with the  <dish1>  and er, yeah. And how you make it is that it\u2019s water mixed with the powder. So, it starts in a box and you just build the water up, pour the powder in and then just, you know, mix that together. And then the actual soup is a separate thing altogether. And depending on what type you\u2019re making, it can take quite a while because it\u2019s, you know, really advanced but,  <misc> . But, erm, yeah. I don\u2019t know how to make the soup  <laugh> . But I do know how to make the, the actual  <dish1>  so, yeah, that\u2019s about it."]}

And a trick my mum taught me is that you can boil the potatoes for a bit before you put them in the oven, which makes them all fluffy and actually cooks them quicker. So yeah, you season it all up and then I actually boil it. Then you put it into the oven and then that\u2019s the potatoes done. Then you get the sausages out of the pack, er, place it on a tray on the foil, put it inside the oven. Then the gravy, it\u2019s, it looks simple but it\u2019s actually kind of hard to make because if you get it too thick, like you\u2019re just eating slob. And if it\u2019s too thin, it\u2019s just water. So, you\u2019ve just got to, as you\u2019re pouring in the hot water, pour in the gra-, the granules at the same time and mix it consistently, otherwise, if you get lumps or it gets all thin, it\u2019s not really going to taste the best. So, whilst you\u2019re doing all of that, the ovens and the sausages are inside. So, erm, really and truly, when you\u2019re making the gravy, you\u2019re practically done. And then, obviously, you\u2019re boiling up all the carrots, the broccolis and then you plate up and you\u2019re done."]}
{"id": "2efac8a5-71aa-4a5d-89fc-c5fe2c3a5eb303030", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl><nl>With the average person in the UK spending 110 minutes on social media, it is inevitable that content displayed across these platforms impact and influence societal norms. The nature of social media aids the ability for societal norms to not only be fueled and accepted across various cultures but also enable this to occur at an accelerated pace. However, the media has been proven to impact self-evaluation in a negative way. For example, there are numerous studies looking at women\u2019s self-evaluation, comparing weight-esteem based on neutral images or ideal images (Brown, Novick, Lord, &amp; Richards, 1992); self-worth based on social comparison (Jones &amp; Buckingham, 2005) etc. Unfortunately, looking at the effects on self-worth in men is minimal. This may be due to the rhetoric that portrays men as emotionless and when any type of emotion is displayed, idioms and phrases like \u2018be a man\u2019 or \u2018stop being a baby\u2019 comes into play. Due to this societal norm, it may make it difficult for men to be able to find appropriate support online and on social media platforms when struggling with the negative impact these sites can have on self worth. It is more acceptable for women to seek help online however, there is less support for men. By researching further into the impacts social media has on men\u2019s self worth, it can enable men to feel more comfortable when facing these issues. The research can aid understanding of this and also result in this topic becoming less taboo, giving a better chance for men to talk freely about their experiences.<nl><nl>I have investigated men\u2019s self worth in the context of social media and my main research question is \u2018How do young men talk about self worth within the context of social media (18-25)?\u2019. My method of analysis is discourse analysis as it allows for in-depth analysis into not only my participant\u2019s language use to construct ideas but also intonation. The interview will take place over a \u2018Zoom\u2019 video call, therefore I am able to have a video recording of all my participants' answers. <nl><nl>AnalysisResults<nl><nl>Through annotating my transcript I was able to select prominent themes that were discussed by my participant in the interview. These themes are spoken of throughout the interview and appear multiple times, even in different questions. From my initial question (line 7) I was able to determine that my participant is an avid user of social media, using it for entertainment purposes as well as using various platforms. This ensures that the questions I ask are relevant to my participant and the answers reflect their social media usage. <nl><nl>Key themes that were discussed by my participant include \"the ideal man\", involving image, appearance and social status; also \"alternate reality\", discussing not only the falseness of social media but also the construction of one's image on social media platforms.<nl><nl>The Ideal Man<nl><nl>The idea of \u2018the ideal man\u2019 featured within my participants answers multiple times, with a construction of what they personally believe to be the ideal man. As opposed to referring to what my participant feels they should look like, my participant instead suggests what others \"should be looking for\" (line 174) in a man, for example, the ideal height \"6 foot 4, or over 6 foot\" (line 175),  the ideal body, having \"six packs\" (line 138), adequate facial hair \"beard\" (line 176) etc. This is a very specific portrayal of men, suggesting that this is a common image for men to hold and strive to achieve. Although men do have an idea of what the ideal body type is they are also aware that in general life, this may not always be the case, with my participant stating that \"It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of me. It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of anyone I know.\" (line 162-163) when asked if he felt represented by men on social media. However, despite this acknowledgement, my participant still felt uncomfortable for comparisons between the appearance of men on social media and himself. My participant used the phrase \"I\u2019d prefer just to leave it at that\" (lines 161 and 294) indicating that men do feel uncomfortable about discussing their appearance, which supports the taboo of men expressing self-doubt and lacking self worth and lowered confidence. This would explain why my participant referred to other people he knows whenever talking about personal appearance, in order to make his answer generalised as opposed to solely him as well as deflect the discomfort about the fact that he is not the ideal man by justifying it with the fact that most people do not look like that. This is supported when he says \"I don\u2019t think many men would want to admit, especially among their peers, wouldn\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re not the ideal person.\" (lines 354-355) <nl><nl>In addition to the body image, a man\u2019s social status and financial status also seems to be prevalent when it comes to describing the \u2018ideal man\u2019 with my participant referring to men with \"seven figures\" (line 138), and men who have \"lavish\" (line 81 ) lifestyles. A given example was the actor and influencer \u2018Dan Bilzerian\u2019; well known for \"constantly flaunting a bunch of money\" (line 241) and \"constantly surrounded by money\". (line 242) This was someone who my participant would refer to as a \u2018role model\u2019 for most males. My participant also referred to the fact that \"men can be successful on social media without looking the greatest\" (line 225), due to their social and financial status. This is supported by the evolutionary psychology theory that women will desire men who are able to provide stability, in the forms of shelter, money, food etc. (Li, Li, Chan &amp; Zhang, 2016). This would explain that now in the digital age, men are able to attract attention with their wealth via social media through posting \"lavish\" (line 81) objects. As it is now commonplace for influencers to be posting this type of content, as my participant stated, \"ordinary people might look at that and think \u2018Well, that\u2019s not me\u2019.\"(line  So this becomes the new goals and the new norm. It is evident that the fact that my participant did not relate to these standards, as when asked if he felt represented by these role models and depictions of men he stated \"No. No. No. No I don\u2019t.\" (line 156) Being unable to relate to the norm often results in incongruence between one's actual self and ideal self which may lower self worth. (Rogers, 1959).<nl><nl>My participant states that they have changed themselves in order to conform with these standards, however wished not to elaborate on how he changed. Instead he referred to people that he knew of, talking about there being  \"a lot of men that will spend a bunch of time at the gym to try and achieve the body that every man wants.\" (lines 347-348) This emphasises that the pressures displayed online and on social media affects men enough for them to wish to change their lifestyle in order to relate to these standards. <nl><nl>Alternate Reality<nl><nl>Throughout my participants answers he refers to the fact that social media is \"not a true depiction\" (line 60) , is a \"very, very fake place\" (lines 104, 71, 63), \"is quite a negative place\" (lines 70, 84) , is \"not real\" (line 107) , is \"very unhealthy\" (line 117), has \"bad sides\" (line 123), is \"the furthest thing from real life\" (lines 147-148) etc. This is common in all the answers, and is said in multiple different ways. My participant referred to social media in very negative ways, and suggested it is a \"toxic\" (line 136) place, despite spending around \"5 hours\" (line 15) per day. This is not an uncommon amount of time on social media, however spending this much time surrounded by something that is perceived as negative by my participant, it is unsurprising that his self confidence is impacted. Also, despite this awareness of the fact that not everything is quite what it seems on social media, the standards are still internalised. This suggests that regardless of the reality or the accuracy of the things that one may be exposed to, they are still accepted by people and becomes the societal norm. My participant also refers to the fact that women are more educated about the ways images are distorted online as opposed to enhancements and photoshop for men.  <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl><nl>From my research, it is evident that despite being aware of the falseness and unrealistic standards of social media, it is evident that young men\u2019s self worth is impacted negatively by the content they are exposed to on social media. Despite being adamant that they are aware of the one sidedness of social media, men continue to make comparisons and draw from this to bring into real life situations. This makes it clear that men experience lowered self confidence not only looks wise but also based on their financial status, social status and more materialistic things. My research has also made it clear that men also feel pressure, and more should be done in terms of support for men online. However, regardless of the gender, social media does tend to display only positive events, making it harder for regular people to accept other events and negative things in real life.", "Okay.

{"id": "2f0dbcd2-d7a9-41cc-8dd5-9d4e6e04ceb907779", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["The Modern State is seen to have five key features: sovereignty, public institutions, territorial association, legitimation and domination (D\u2019Amato, 2018). These characteristics can be highlighted as territory (an area with defined borders), external and internal sovereignty where a state must be able to defend its territory and not be too dependent on another power. A state achieves sovereignty when it is recognised by the family of states as the \u2018sole governing authority within its territory and as the legal equal of other states\u2019 (The Modern State, 2020). Furthermore, there has to be legitimacy in which there is recognised rule, examples of this are traditional legitimacy, charismatic legitimacy and rational-legal legitimacy; the legitimacy enhances a state\u2019s sovereignty at a lower cost. The last characteristic is modern bureaucracy, this is required to generate as well as collect revenue. In this essay we will be discussing and critically examining Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, who criticizes the moralistic view of authority. Machiavelli although seen as an evil man, had a large influence on the future of modern civilisation especially in comparison to the artists of his time. <nl><nl>For Machiavelli, moral basis on which to judge the difference between illegitimate and legitimate uses of power does not exist, arguing that this does not add to the actual possession of power \u2013 rather the legitimacy rests upon the threat of coercive force. His beliefs rest in those that the leaders should avoid the common values of justice and mercy in preference to the use of violence and fear, particularly if it is in the best interest such as through gaining and expanding political power. Historians have stated Machiavelli to be the \u2018teacher of evil\u2019 such as Leo Strauss (McShea, 1963). However, Machiavelli has been credited with formulating the \"modern concept of the state\", that is understood in the Weberian sense of a \u2018form of rule possessing a monopoly of coercive authority within a set territorial boundary\u2019 (Nederman, 2019). Machiavelli derived his views from the experience of the Caesura Borgia.  However, Machiavelli did contribute to the way we understand the modern state now as he proposed his own conception of the \"civil principality\" whilst subverting his previous medieval idea of state as regime (Sellers,2015). However, it should be noted that force is not the only weapon to rule the people so his argument can be seen as psychologically weak.<nl><nl>Machiavelli also states that principality can be seen to be governed by a single ruler and is helped by anointed ministers which is the case in many current states seen today. Machiavelli states that the idea of taking over depends on the character of region than the character of the prince, he has the strong belief that the citizens will recollect and fight for their liberty. Although we have grown out of medieval brutality, it can be argued that the modern-day equivalent of killing is to send rivals to jail or allow opponents to lose if there is indecisiveness. An example of this is Brexit, where the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was seen as indecisive and therefore could not gain enough votes in time for the referendum. Another way Machiavelli is modernised is through the idea that leaders will need to make severe decisions, such as through firing a member of the cabinet. An example of this is the Night of Long Knives in 1962 where Macmillan sacked a third of his cabinet. Nevertheless, Machiavelli ignored individualism and had one sided views of human nature which can be viewed as a critical flaw.<nl><nl>For Machiavelli, law is also impossible to follow without the required military as arms are a requirement in order for leaders to establish great frameworks. Although it can be criticised as we do not follow medieval combat, there are still some aspects which apply to the modern state, for instance the concept that an army from your own principality is most beneficial for defending yourself \u2013 and this concept is universally accepted. Machiavelli also made the point that there is conflict of interest which can be seen in the modern state also, for example through the leak of the Panama papers. What is also seen in the modern state is Machiavelli\u2019s view on auxiliary troops being faithful to someone else, for example through the rise of the Taliban, as although it was intended for the Taliban to fight the Soviet Union, they later turned and became the lead terrorist group. In Antonio Negri\u2019s view, Machiavelli belongs to a \u2018political alternative of modern thought grounded on a revolutionary version of constituent power\u2019 (Negri and Maurizia Boscagli, 2009). However, Quentin Skinner and J.G.A Pocock write that we should regard Machiavelli as part of the republican tradition, i.e. as part of the living legacy of Aristotelian philosophy (Roecklein, 2012). Nonetheless, Machiavelli was the first modern thinker to have thought of the State as an independent entity and not recognising any religious organisation exterior to it and The Prince has been a choice of several political leaders such as Louis XIV, Napoleon Bonaparte and Benito Mussolini. <nl><nl>The modern state was \u2018constituted by an abstraction from personal to impersonal rule\u2019 (Mansfield, 1983). With Machiavelli we encounter a challenge to the classical regime which is expressed in his use of stato (his stato is someone\u2019s to acquire), whereas for Aristotle\u2019s regime there is some ordering of the inhabitants of the city. The central theme of Machiavelli\u2019s political ideas is power with absolute state being the end. The state is viewed as superior to all associations and is sovereign as well as autonomous however he also stated that religion cannot influence politics and the church cannot control the state, which is not the case. <nl><nl>Comparing Machiavelli to other theorists allows for us to critically evaluate him further. Plato had the vision of every human being born into a division which was maintained and creating an arrangement for the state in the course of classism whereas Machiavelli proposed with the aim of sovereignty to support the nation in which the leader controls and protects its citizens. Machiavelli\u2019s concept of virt\u00fa highlights the utilitarian needs of the country. For Machiavelli virt\u00fa outweighs virtue in times of need whilst Plato believes a \u2018just ruler must behave the same at all times\u2019 however we have to consider they were writing in different eras, as Plato\u2019s philosophy is based on utopian principles and Machiavelli is viewed as a realist (Abrams, M, 2017). Aristotle divides government into two categories: good and bad with good forms fall aristocracy and under bad fall oligarchy. Aristotle wanted to help society achieve goodness through politics whereas on the other hand Machiavelli sought to achieve the maintenance of power and stability. They have differing views in terms of Aristotle claimed that if an entire state is made to fear their ruler, this would cause unhappiness however Machiavelli suggested that it is better to be feared than loved as it creates balance. However, they are on similar sides when it comes to liberation, as in the Prince it stated such ruler should not dictate the actions of others, but all together Machiavelli was seeking a practical type of politics whilst Aristotle took a rather idealistic approach (Tabone, 2020).  <nl><nl>Hobbes and Machiavelli have fascinating ideas on human nature impacting the state as the common theme is the usage of fear, meaning power needs to be acquired and maintained but we have to remember that Machiavelli\u2019s time period involved the peak of absolutism and hierarchies. Philosophers such a John Locke have directly opposing views on government. Locke\u2019s perception of revolt as a right gave people excessive power compared to the government, this did not exist during the time of Machiavelli. Locke believed in the idea of the government working for the people, however this is directly opposed to Machiavelli\u2019s thought that the ruler should do what it takes to remain in power (Chris Joseph, 2014). Machiavelli recommended that coercion should be used in order to govern whereas Locke favoured a social contract with the concept of dual accountability. Although Machiavelli\u2019s concept of coercion is flawed, he did recognise that rulers could not govern by this alone and advocated for the use of cunning and subterfuge, Locke\u2019s social contract did not contain an element of this. Machiavelli had a pessimistic view of individuals and believed human beings are fundamentally bad whereas Locke was more optimistic. In the modern state it follows Machiavelli\u2019s model more as the rulers in the modern state are comprised of the rich and powerful in society. Mill and Machiavelli also have the same solution to government in freedom of speech, they are both aware that people cannot have a hand in ruling itself. <nl><nl>Political leaders and their followers believed that Machiavellism was a disease infesting the politic body. He is still regarded with a negative reputation, but he still aids us to understand the modern state. Machiavelli promoted the central role of a citizen in preserving institutions which is reflected through the meaning of the Second Amendment in the U.S. Constitution (Bernard, 2009). Among modern believers of Machiavelli, there are Burmese generals such as Web Jiabao, the Former Premier of China and Lord Mandelson (Bernard, 2009). Machiavelli and Pareto agree in terms of this where they say egotism or selfishness as a natural property of the human species (Femia, 2013). According to Machiavellism though, the principle aim of prince is the unification as well as welfare of the state which showed reality of practical politics. He deduced that the internal unity and powerful government were the essential of any state by observing the affairs of the interstate rivalries. The sole aim of the prince is also to increase power in ways such as to be an expert in managing and organising a war- power is seen as the only reason of the state. <nl><nl>To conclude Machiavelli contributes to the \u2018comprehension of constituent power as a living force within social order\u2019 (Lucchese, 2016). He developed a revolutionary position, suggesting that political conflict is not a destabilising factor, but rather the grounding force of free republics. His concepts and ideas are often misunderstood as he displayed rare intellect to become a partisan in an age where absolute monarchy held control (Mathur, 1991). All together Machiavelli was the first thinker who justified secular state and the first advocate for autonomy for the state. He unfairly became associated with evil through his critical work written about The Prince, and although it did not get translated until almost a hundred years later the negative view about Machiavelli had already been established into Elizabethan England. All together he communicated priority to the state and put it above morality and religion as it is the highest form of social organisation and most essential to promote human welfare, and this is seen clearly in the modern state. Machiavelli\u2019s Prince dealt exclusively with the interests of a single person of power that focuses on only the leader\u2019s welfare in mind whereas the theories of Plato, Aristotle, Locke and Mill dealt with the welfare of society. However, in the modern state there Machiavelli did consider that the Prince needed to maintain good relations with the people which is what we observe. It can be agreed the way that Machiavelli talks about the state as Machiavelli was a realist.", " Okay. So, usually, I would be working so in that case, I would probably wake up, do my normal exercise and then eat but I would eat breakfast at around ten to eleven. So, that would either be pancakes or mostly beans on toast, eggs on toast, anything with my beans, I don\u2019t usually eat normal beans, I like spicy beans, which is a bit weird. But yeah, anything like that. If there\u2019s any, if it\u2019s around lunchtime, it would probably be something frozen so like frozen pizza or like frozen burgers. In my household, we\u2019re not allowed any meat so we\u2019re completely vegetarian in this house. So, that would, so it would probably be like a margherita pizza or, you know, you have those like readymade noodles, could be those. But yeah, lunch would probably be a quick meal. Dinner is probably where we like eat the most. So, dinner for me, so I\u2019m on, I\u2019m  <continental_adj>  so it would typically be Asia-, it would be  <country1_adj>  food or sometimes, it, anything we eat would probably be vegetable orientated. So, it would either be, if it\u2019s Mexican, we\u2019ll have like loads of vegetables in a wrap, we have veg, veggie pasta. We eat dinner at around six to seven and then if any of us are hungry after, there\u2019s always like chocolate or snacks or food that we can eat after but usually, we\u2019re all full by dinner anyways. So yeah, that would be my typical meal. I don\u2019t usually snack in this house but if I\u2019m working then it\u2019s completely different. If I\u2019m working then I\u2019m going to be eating dinner. I mean, I\u2019m going to be eating lunch at work but my lunch will be dinner from the day before. And then with just a packet of crisps or like a few Oreos or a few biscuits. But yeah, that\u2019s usually my, my meal.<new>Probably the food that I eat around ten to eleven after I\u2019ve exercised because the bea-, that beans on toast or like bea-, eggs or whatever, they give you a lot of energy. And let\u2019s say like I have like a banana milkshake or something with it, it would just mean for the rest of the day that I don\u2019t snack. And that if I, the rest of the day I can go without eating until dinner. For example, today, I just had like two mozzarella and pesto sandwiches. I\u2019m probably not going to be eating until like six or seven p.m. So, that\u2019s, yeah, I would say that\u2019s the most important meal, just \u2018cause you have energy. Otherwise, if you\u2019re waiting for dinner, by then my stomach aches and then you know when you go, you\u2019re in bed and you, you\u2019re just tired because you haven\u2019t eaten? Yeah, so, I, brea-, like that lun-, breakfast or brunch, call it brunch, yeah."]}

So, I could wake up, go to the bathroom next door, brush my teeth and then come back, get a snack. So, that\u2019s just the start of the day as I'm just, you know, relaxing in my room. Then I\u2019ll go downstairs in about an hour or so, cook some breakfast so eggs, er, bread, beans, sausages and, you know, all the trimmings, bacon as well but I\u2019ve actually kind of reduced on that recently. So, then that\u2019s breakfast. And then usually, I\u2019d set off for the library so around, maybe, eleven, twelvish. And then, er, on the way to the library, I\u2019ll probably pick up a few things from  <supermarket1>  so, maybe, a meal deal and a few fruits and drinks and whatever. And then pretty much from midday till about five, maybe, I would have just had the meal deal and then I\u2019ll make my way home. And then when I get home, a cheeky little spaghetti bolognaise to start the night off. And then yeah, it just depends, really, when I sleep when I have my next meal but really and truly, it\u2019s probably another sort of snack, yeah. <new>In terms of, er, which one do I like the most or which one is most beneficial to me?<new>Oh.

I used to make eggs, the, the bread, the, warm up the beans, you know, I, I liked cooking breakfast.

It\u2019s just a different sort of, like a whole different country, different culture, different taste, different flavours. So, but, erm, something like dumplings, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have it on a normal day in your house. So, if I had that. And then yeah, you could go to the basic stuff like, er, egg fried rice or chicken fried rice, king prawn fried rice but, yeah, just different culture, I\u2019d say.<new>Oh, my favourite dish to cook. Erm, I mean, I can cook but I wouldn\u2019t say I'm the  <chef>  of the house  <laugh> . So, there\u2019s not much of a, a range to pick from. But erm, I would say, I can make my own roasts quite well, actually, er.<new>Yeah.<new><laugh> , okay. So, erm, it starts by getting your King Edward potatoes in. They usually have a bit of a red tint to them on the outside. So, then you just wash the potatoes, peel them, er, put a bit of salt, a bit of herbs on them, you know, cut them up, er, mix it all together. Then that\u2019s the potatoes done. And a trick my mum taught me is that you can boil the potatoes for a bit before you put them in the oven, which makes them all fluffy and actually cooks them quicker. So yeah, you season it all up and then I actually boil it. Then you put it into the oven and then that\u2019s the potatoes done. Then you get the sausages out of the pack, er, place it on a tray on the foil, put it inside the oven. Then the gravy, it\u2019s, it looks simple but it\u2019s actually kind of hard to make because if you get it too thick, like you\u2019re just eating slob. And if it\u2019s too thin, it\u2019s just water. So, you\u2019ve just got to, as you\u2019re pouring in the hot water, pour in the gra-, the granules at the same time and mix it consistently, otherwise, if you get lumps or it gets all thin, it\u2019s not really going to taste the best.

And they\u2019re both, you know, quite smiling a bit, so, erm. She\u2019s also, the teacher\u2019s also rolled their sleeves up, and she\u2019s got a black hairband on her right wrist, and she\u2019s let her blonde hair down. And erm, the student is sitting in the chair with her braids, and she\u2019s smiling quite a bit with her teeth showing as well. And erm, she\u2019s using her right hand to touch her chest, so I think they\u2019re just sharing a moment. So that\u2019s image one. And erm,  <misc>  in image two, there\u2019s a white background with a sort of uni, er, couch setup. And there\u2019s two males; er, one who\u2019s got a black earring in his left ear, and er, another who\u2019s also wearing a red, er, red shirt over a white, er, t-shirt. And they\u2019re both, er, sitting behind a Mac, and they\u2019re just looking at the computer. So I think they might be computing students or some type of technology involved in their, er, degrees also. Erm, the laptop\u2019s actually on a black sort of coffee table. And erm, yeah, it just looks like they\u2019re students on the same sort of course and, you know, just doing a bit of work together. So that\u2019s image two. And in image three, the background is almost a circle of white beads, o- placed on a black, er, background board. And it\u2019s got two, er, people in it. Er, one, er female and one male. Erm, she\u2019s wearing a leather black jacket and he\u2019s also g- holding a book. And I do believe there might be a third person in the picture but they\u2019re just out of the scene. So yeah, they\u2019re sitting on a, I think it\u2019s a red or sort of er, a rose type couch, and er, they\u2019ve got a glass coffee table in front of them. Er, the man\u2019s got a beard and, er, he\u2019s smiling quite a bit, with a green top under his black, er, inspector gadget jacket,  <laugh>  some people would say. Erm, he\u2019s wearing some, er, brown khaki trousers \u2013 no, brown trousers, yeah. And er, the lady\u2019s wearing some brown boots with red leggings, I would say. Erm, you can\u2019t really see it too caref- too well, but er, she\u2019s got some earrings I think, that are dangling. So er, yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it. So yeah, I would say they\u2019re, they\u2019re both students as well, because they\u2019ve got a book. And er, I don\u2019t know who the third character in the picture is as we can\u2019t really see, but we can just see one of his hands. But yeah. And there\u2019s a leaflet on the glass coffee table in front of them. And that\u2019s it for picture three."]}

{"id": "e4d23391-1219-4ecb-b3e9-852e15dcd460", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>What is religion? Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961). This definition further criticizes religion as something which individuals turn to out of worry and desperation.<nl>In addition to the functional definitions of religion which can be seen above, there is also the substantive definition of religion which can be investigated. Substantive definitions tend to define religion in terms of its content rather than its function. Here, it is common for the existence of a \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018supernatural being\u2019 to be present when defining religion. This can be seen in Roland Robertsons definition of religion, where he states that \u2018religion refers to the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life\u2019 (Robertson, 1970). Such definitions however, can be seen as problematic to the wider community. This definition of religion by Robertson, clearly necessitates the existence of a god, and rejects any ideas that do not have a \u2018god\u2019 at the centre of their ideology to be classed as religion. This would not allow for beliefs such as Buddhism to be categorised as a religion, due to the fact that it is not based upon the concept of a creator- God (Gethin, 1998). Robertson\u2019s view on religion is supported by Max Weber, who also uses a substantive concept of religion, seeing it as a belief in a divine entity which cannot be explained scientifically (Weber, 2009). In other words, the belief in a god is required for a concept to be deemed as a religion. Ronald Dworkin however, opposes this notion and states that \u2018religion, does not necessarily mean a belief in god\u2019 and \u2018religion is an interpretive concept\u2019 (Dworkin, 2013). Dworkins use of the word \u2018interpretive\u2019, infers that religion can have a different meaning, dependent on the individual. Buddhism has now been linked to the global category of a world religion (McMahan, 2012), causing much debate upon what constitutes religion. This begs the question, who has set the requirements for what can and cannot be defined as a religion? Who has the right to dictate this? As Aldridge states \u2018Defining religion involves an exercise of power\u2019 (Aldridge, 2007).<nl><nl>Religion in International Relations- Post Secularization and Foreign Policy <nl>Often, when analysing religion within the international relations scene it can be deemed an aspect which is hastily overlooked. Religion is rarely included in most major theories of international relations and this can be ascribed to major Western social thinkers rejecting the notion of religion (Fox and Sandler, 2004), as discussed previously. As a particular scholar illustrated , \u2018the role of religion in explaining attitudes toward issues of international relations is somewhat limited\u2019 (Jelen, 1994). However, when further analysing international relations and conflict, it is clear that religion can be seen as a crucial element which should not be disregarded. It has been said that \u2018Domestic conflicts, including religious conflicts are becoming increasingly international issues\u2019 (Fox and Sandler, 2004). This extract from \u2018Bringing religion into International Relations\u2019, further emphasis the vital role that religion can play when assessing international relations. Examples of conflict which involve religion are The Israel Palestine conflict and the Thirty Years war. Here, religion can be key in resolving and understanding the clash, possibly presenting a recourse. <nl>Post secularization, it has been noted that a global resurgence of religion is transforming our understanding of international relations (Thomas, 2005). As there has been an increase in religious actors, it has recently become a vital analytical focus (Haynes,2005). These religious actors can include examples such as foreign policy taking into account religion, as well as transnational factors. The more that religion begins to play a pivotal role in making country decisions, the more clarity there is on what a substantial role religion plays on the international scene. There has previously been a narrative which has pushed the notion that the term \u2018religion\u2019 carries negative connotations and only leads to tension and ferocity, bringing nothing of substance to the international relations division. This adheres to the \u2018Westphalian presumption\u2019, which holds that \u2018religious and cultural pluralism cannot be accommodated in international public life\u2019 (Thomas, 2005). In other words, faith must be conceived as an internal matter to the sovereign state in order to avoid the risk of potential religious wars. This has encouraged using scientific knowledge and clear reasoning as justification for decisions over religion. It is clear that during these strongly secular times, there wasn\u2019t a want to define the term \u2018religion\u2019 from an international perspective. However, as religion began to make a return to the international scene, events such as 911 and Samuel Huntingtons\u2019 famous \u2018The clash of civilizations?\u2019 thesis (Huntington, 2000), only drew more attention to the importance of religion on the international relations front. As there was deemed to be a rise in religious clash and issues, with pivotal events such as 911, the topic of religion had to be assessed on the international scale. <nl>Many would also agree that religion has an important role to play in creating and shaping beliefs, which may in turn influence the formulation of state policy and foreign policy considerations. An instance of this can be seen with President George W. Bush, where he referred to the US having a \u2018calling\u2019 and \u2018mission\u2019 by the \u2018Maker of heaven\u2019 in his speeches on Foreign Policy (Judis, 2005). Not only can it be inferred here that George Bush is attempting to appeal to his majority audience with his \u2018faithful\u2019 language, but his references to God here explain how religion has had a direct impact on the foreign policy choices made. Bush\u2019s choice of language and rhetoric is extremely influential in shaping perspectives of the US citizens opinions on foreign policy. It was found here that there was a clear link between religion and opinion on U.S foreign policy in the Middle East (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). In particular, Evangelical Christians are more supportive of Bush\u2019s Foreign policy on the Iraq war and his foreign policy in general (Pew Research Centre, 2020). In a specific study carried out by Pew Research Centre, even after adjusting for the identity of the respondents groups, the impact of Evangelical beliefs towards foreign policy towards the Middle East remained statistically important (Pew Research Centre, 2020). These results are significant as they provide confirmatory proof that the position of Evangelical affiliation in shaping public opinion on foreign policy is important. It is also fundamental in understanding what a large effect a single religious group can have on how a country is run. The Middle East and President George Bush are a great area of focus due to the Iraq war being a matter which has concerned wide-spread public opinion since 2003 (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). As Boyer stated \u2018For many believers in biblical prophecy, the Bush administration\u2019s go-it-alone foreign policy, hands-off attitude toward the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and proposed war on Iraq, are not simply actions in the national self-interest or an extension of the war on terrorism, but part of an unfolding divine plan\u2019 (Boyer, 2003). This quote highlights how it is recognised that many individuals feel as though these conflicts directly involve religion and god, not only country policy. This infers that individuals will use faith as a major indicator when deciding their stance on subjects such as the Iraq war and foreign policy. On the contrary, research from the Pew Research centre suggests that people feel as though their faith does not define their opinion on the Iraq War (Different Faiths, Different Messages, 2020). Either way, the fact that there is much debate around religion probes several questions on the topic of faith, making it a valid matter when discussing international relations. As religion is increasingly being used for justification as well as indication, it is an important matter to consider on the international scene. \u00a8<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, when looking at definitions of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the context of both Sociology and International relations, it is obvious that there is much debate around what the word entails and its specific effects on society, good or bad. It is clear however, that religion has played a large role in shaping and moulding the current societies that we live in today, as well as the international relations scene, be it secular or not. Although there may be much debate upon whether the consequences of religion are \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 and \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019, the simple fact that decisions have and are being made based upon this, make it a crucial element that must be taken into consideration when looking at both society and international relations. There is no doubt that further research in the field of religion is vital and needed in order for a wider understanding of religion and its impact in both contexts.", "Dear <addr5_IN_SN>, <nl><nl>This email is in regards to the languages part of my course.

I'm writing this email on behalf of us all in regards to the maintenance of the house.<nl><nl>Firstly, the fridge has been a recurring problem. This is because from day one it has always been difficult to fully close it - partly due to the design of the cupboard door and the fact that the freezer isn\u2019t working properly and as a result the ice builds up and doesn\u2019t allow it to close. This further prevents the fridge from closing properly in addition to the cupboard design door. This ongoing issue has resulted in numerous amounts of food not being kept properly and the unfortunate throwing away of them. We are all experiencing hard times as we attempt to continue living with COVID19, therefore the continuous cycle of buying food and it going off due to a dysfucntional and ineffective fridge makes these times just that much harder.<nl><nl>A contractor was sent out once and the service he provided was not good enough as this is still a very important issue - if not the most important as it directly effects our health and safety.<nl><nl>Another issue in the kitchen is that one of the lower cabinet doors has come off. I believe the inside components have snapped and the repair will require new parts.<nl><nl>The last of the issues in the kitchen is the metal wall section behind the sink. The bottom part of it has opened and essentially began to peel off. This also needs to be fixed because if its allowed to continue peeling the wall behind it will start to get wet from the sink and cause further damage to the property.<nl><nl>In line with maintenance requests, it has also been brought to my attention that the top floor tenant is extremely unhappy with the mattress she is having to use as she says all she can feel is the springs within it. This causes severe joint and shoulder pain - again this is important as it has a direct impact on her health. If this could be replaced it would be most helpful, as we are timely paying tenants who don\u2019t believe this to be an unjust request.<nl><nl>I did contact the <business> property management mobile contact number ending 152, I was directed to report all maintenance issues through property file. However, we were not given access to this platform and so can\u2019t use it. I did reply and let the person know this but I received no reply to that message and the maintenance issues are still outstanding.<nl><nl>I look forward to what solutions you are able to offer and hope to hear from you soon.<nl><nl><part_FN_SN>"]}
{"id": "0bf4eae6-fec8-4eeb-b9f7-a066c4c403be01058", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["New liberalism was born after a new wave of liberals in the late 19th century to the early 20th century challenged the positions of classical liberals such as Adam Smith and John Locke. Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state.", "For the most recent armpit I used google chrome. <nl><nl>My <system> just doesn\u2019t seem to work and I\u2019ve been trying to submit it and that\u2019s why I sent it as an attachment in an email to <group> as I\u2019ve no other way of submitting this very important work<nl><new><nl>Yh that\u2019s fine. <nl>What time you lot tryna meet up and where ? <new>Nah just meet up after<new>Yh that\u2019s fine <nl>Make a gc and add my number so I know exactly where to meet you<nl><nl><phone_number><new>Afternoon, <nl> <nl>My name is <part_FN_SN> and I live in <building> \u2013 Floor <floor_number>, Flat <house_number1>, Room <house_number2>.<nl>My booking Id is : <id_number><nl> <nl>I\u2019m sending this email to officially inform you of my cancellation of my tenancy.<nl> <nl>As this return of room goes against my original plans, would it be possible to keep my belongings in the room until the official return of room date : <DDth> <month> <YYYY>?<nl> <nl>Hope to hear from you soon. <nl> <nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hi <addr4_FN>,<nl> <nl>Sorry for sending it so late.<nl> <nl>If you could just read over it, edit it and add it onto the poster as you see fit.

So yeah, I would say  <restaurant2>  was my favourite before.<new>Er, so I used to be a half chicken, peri chips guy. But I recently transformed into a five chicken wings and peri chips and garlic bread. Yeah.<new>Er, I think, er, er, when I was in  <country1>  and, er, my grandma made me one of our traditional foods. It\u2019s called  <dish1> ,  <SPELLS_OUT_DISH1> . So, er, she made it herself, personally and, er, it was just quite nice, really, to have such a elderly person cooking you such a traditional meal as you\u2019re abroad as well. So, it all just came together quite nicely, actually. <new>Yeah. Yeah, I do. So, it\u2019s like a doughy, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s a circle and it\u2019s like a doughy type thing so you can literally just, er, pick it up with your hands. And you eat it with a sort of, erm, soup. So, you literally put it in the middle of the bowl and then you pour the soup around it and usually, depending on the type of soup it is, it might have different meats or fishes. So, you could have a fish soup or a meat soup. I usually prefer the, the meat soups. So, erm, you could have a meat soup one with the  <dish1>  and er, yeah. And how you make it is that it\u2019s water mixed with the powder. So, it starts in a box and you just build the water up, pour the powder in and then just, you know, mix that together. And then the actual soup is a separate thing altogether. And depending on what type you\u2019re making, it can take quite a while because it\u2019s, you know, really advanced but,  <misc> . But, erm, yeah. I don\u2019t know how to make the soup  <laugh> . But I do know how to make the, the actual  <dish1>  so, yeah, that\u2019s about it."]}

{"id": "ccbaad25-50c9-495a-809e-0209e8af6dd407910", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["The Modern State is seen to have five key features: sovereignty, public institutions, territorial association, legitimation and domination (D\u2019Amato, 2018). These characteristics can be highlighted as territory (an area with defined borders), external and internal sovereignty where a state must be able to defend its territory and not be too dependent on another power. A state achieves sovereignty when it is recognised by the family of states as the \u2018sole governing authority within its territory and as the legal equal of other states\u2019 (The Modern State, 2020). Furthermore, there has to be legitimacy in which there is recognised rule, examples of this are traditional legitimacy, charismatic legitimacy and rational-legal legitimacy; the legitimacy enhances a state\u2019s sovereignty at a lower cost. The last characteristic is modern bureaucracy, this is required to generate as well as collect revenue. In this essay we will be discussing and critically examining Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, who criticizes the moralistic view of authority. Machiavelli although seen as an evil man, had a large influence on the future of modern civilisation especially in comparison to the artists of his time. <nl><nl>For Machiavelli, moral basis on which to judge the difference between illegitimate and legitimate uses of power does not exist, arguing that this does not add to the actual possession of power \u2013 rather the legitimacy rests upon the threat of coercive force. His beliefs rest in those that the leaders should avoid the common values of justice and mercy in preference to the use of violence and fear, particularly if it is in the best interest such as through gaining and expanding political power. Historians have stated Machiavelli to be the \u2018teacher of evil\u2019 such as Leo Strauss (McShea, 1963). However, Machiavelli has been credited with formulating the \"modern concept of the state\", that is understood in the Weberian sense of a \u2018form of rule possessing a monopoly of coercive authority within a set territorial boundary\u2019 (Nederman, 2019). Machiavelli derived his views from the experience of the Caesura Borgia.  However, Machiavelli did contribute to the way we understand the modern state now as he proposed his own conception of the \"civil principality\" whilst subverting his previous medieval idea of state as regime (Sellers,2015). However, it should be noted that force is not the only weapon to rule the people so his argument can be seen as psychologically weak.<nl><nl>Machiavelli also states that principality can be seen to be governed by a single ruler and is helped by anointed ministers which is the case in many current states seen today. Machiavelli states that the idea of taking over depends on the character of region than the character of the prince, he has the strong belief that the citizens will recollect and fight for their liberty. Although we have grown out of medieval brutality, it can be argued that the modern-day equivalent of killing is to send rivals to jail or allow opponents to lose if there is indecisiveness. An example of this is Brexit, where the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was seen as indecisive and therefore could not gain enough votes in time for the referendum. Another way Machiavelli is modernised is through the idea that leaders will need to make severe decisions, such as through firing a member of the cabinet. An example of this is the Night of Long Knives in 1962 where Macmillan sacked a third of his cabinet. Nevertheless, Machiavelli ignored individualism and had one sided views of human nature which can be viewed as a critical flaw.<nl><nl>For Machiavelli, law is also impossible to follow without the required military as arms are a requirement in order for leaders to establish great frameworks. Although it can be criticised as we do not follow medieval combat, there are still some aspects which apply to the modern state, for instance the concept that an army from your own principality is most beneficial for defending yourself \u2013 and this concept is universally accepted. Machiavelli also made the point that there is conflict of interest which can be seen in the modern state also, for example through the leak of the Panama papers. What is also seen in the modern state is Machiavelli\u2019s view on auxiliary troops being faithful to someone else, for example through the rise of the Taliban, as although it was intended for the Taliban to fight the Soviet Union, they later turned and became the lead terrorist group. In Antonio Negri\u2019s view, Machiavelli belongs to a \u2018political alternative of modern thought grounded on a revolutionary version of constituent power\u2019 (Negri and Maurizia Boscagli, 2009). However, Quentin Skinner and J.G.A Pocock write that we should regard Machiavelli as part of the republican tradition, i.e. as part of the living legacy of Aristotelian philosophy (Roecklein, 2012). Nonetheless, Machiavelli was the first modern thinker to have thought of the State as an independent entity and not recognising any religious organisation exterior to it and The Prince has been a choice of several political leaders such as Louis XIV, Napoleon Bonaparte and Benito Mussolini. <nl><nl>The modern state was \u2018constituted by an abstraction from personal to impersonal rule\u2019 (Mansfield, 1983). With Machiavelli we encounter a challenge to the classical regime which is expressed in his use of stato (his stato is someone\u2019s to acquire), whereas for Aristotle\u2019s regime there is some ordering of the inhabitants of the city. The central theme of Machiavelli\u2019s political ideas is power with absolute state being the end. The state is viewed as superior to all associations and is sovereign as well as autonomous however he also stated that religion cannot influence politics and the church cannot control the state, which is not the case. <nl><nl>Comparing Machiavelli to other theorists allows for us to critically evaluate him further. Plato had the vision of every human being born into a division which was maintained and creating an arrangement for the state in the course of classism whereas Machiavelli proposed with the aim of sovereignty to support the nation in which the leader controls and protects its citizens. Machiavelli\u2019s concept of virt\u00fa highlights the utilitarian needs of the country. For Machiavelli virt\u00fa outweighs virtue in times of need whilst Plato believes a \u2018just ruler must behave the same at all times\u2019 however we have to consider they were writing in different eras, as Plato\u2019s philosophy is based on utopian principles and Machiavelli is viewed as a realist (Abrams, M, 2017). Aristotle divides government into two categories: good and bad with good forms fall aristocracy and under bad fall oligarchy. Aristotle wanted to help society achieve goodness through politics whereas on the other hand Machiavelli sought to achieve the maintenance of power and stability. They have differing views in terms of Aristotle claimed that if an entire state is made to fear their ruler, this would cause unhappiness however Machiavelli suggested that it is better to be feared than loved as it creates balance. However, they are on similar sides when it comes to liberation, as in the Prince it stated such ruler should not dictate the actions of others, but all together Machiavelli was seeking a practical type of politics whilst Aristotle took a rather idealistic approach (Tabone, 2020).  <nl><nl>Hobbes and Machiavelli have fascinating ideas on human nature impacting the state as the common theme is the usage of fear, meaning power needs to be acquired and maintained but we have to remember that Machiavelli\u2019s time period involved the peak of absolutism and hierarchies. Philosophers such a John Locke have directly opposing views on government. Locke\u2019s perception of revolt as a right gave people excessive power compared to the government, this did not exist during the time of Machiavelli. Locke believed in the idea of the government working for the people, however this is directly opposed to Machiavelli\u2019s thought that the ruler should do what it takes to remain in power (Chris Joseph, 2014). Machiavelli recommended that coercion should be used in order to govern whereas Locke favoured a social contract with the concept of dual accountability. Although Machiavelli\u2019s concept of coercion is flawed, he did recognise that rulers could not govern by this alone and advocated for the use of cunning and subterfuge, Locke\u2019s social contract did not contain an element of this. Machiavelli had a pessimistic view of individuals and believed human beings are fundamentally bad whereas Locke was more optimistic. In the modern state it follows Machiavelli\u2019s model more as the rulers in the modern state are comprised of the rich and powerful in society. Mill and Machiavelli also have the same solution to government in freedom of speech, they are both aware that people cannot have a hand in ruling itself. <nl><nl>Political leaders and their followers believed that Machiavellism was a disease infesting the politic body. He is still regarded with a negative reputation, but he still aids us to understand the modern state. Machiavelli promoted the central role of a citizen in preserving institutions which is reflected through the meaning of the Second Amendment in the U.S. Constitution (Bernard, 2009). Among modern believers of Machiavelli, there are Burmese generals such as Web Jiabao, the Former Premier of China and Lord Mandelson (Bernard, 2009). Machiavelli and Pareto agree in terms of this where they say egotism or selfishness as a natural property of the human species (Femia, 2013). According to Machiavellism though, the principle aim of prince is the unification as well as welfare of the state which showed reality of practical politics. He deduced that the internal unity and powerful government were the essential of any state by observing the affairs of the interstate rivalries. The sole aim of the prince is also to increase power in ways such as to be an expert in managing and organising a war- power is seen as the only reason of the state. <nl><nl>To conclude Machiavelli contributes to the \u2018comprehension of constituent power as a living force within social order\u2019 (Lucchese, 2016). He developed a revolutionary position, suggesting that political conflict is not a destabilising factor, but rather the grounding force of free republics. His concepts and ideas are often misunderstood as he displayed rare intellect to become a partisan in an age where absolute monarchy held control (Mathur, 1991). All together Machiavelli was the first thinker who justified secular state and the first advocate for autonomy for the state. He unfairly became associated with evil through his critical work written about The Prince, and although it did not get translated until almost a hundred years later the negative view about Machiavelli had already been established into Elizabethan England. All together he communicated priority to the state and put it above morality and religion as it is the highest form of social organisation and most essential to promote human welfare, and this is seen clearly in the modern state. Machiavelli\u2019s Prince dealt exclusively with the interests of a single person of power that focuses on only the leader\u2019s welfare in mind whereas the theories of Plato, Aristotle, Locke and Mill dealt with the welfare of society. However, in the modern state there Machiavelli did consider that the Prince needed to maintain good relations with the people which is what we observe. It can be agreed the way that Machiavelli talks about the state as Machiavelli was a realist.", "I\u2019m not in your group anymore, you\u2019re going to have to contact them individually<new>Hey!

We do not want to make any of our group members feel like they cannot talk to us, especially if they are struggling.

Nevertheless, Machiavelli ignored individualism and had one sided views of human nature which can be viewed as a critical flaw.<nl><nl>For Machiavelli, law is also impossible to follow without the required military as arms are a requirement in order for leaders to establish great frameworks. Although it can be criticised as we do not follow medieval combat, there are still some aspects which apply to the modern state, for instance the concept that an army from your own principality is most beneficial for defending yourself \u2013 and this concept is universally accepted. Machiavelli also made the point that there is conflict of interest which can be seen in the modern state also, for example through the leak of the Panama papers. What is also seen in the modern state is Machiavelli\u2019s view on auxiliary troops being faithful to someone else, for example through the rise of the Taliban, as although it was intended for the Taliban to fight the Soviet Union, they later turned and became the lead terrorist group. In Antonio Negri\u2019s view, Machiavelli belongs to a \u2018political alternative of modern thought grounded on a revolutionary version of constituent power\u2019 (Negri and Maurizia Boscagli, 2009). However, Quentin Skinner and J.G.A Pocock write that we should regard Machiavelli as part of the republican tradition, i.e. as part of the living legacy of Aristotelian philosophy (Roecklein, 2012). Nonetheless, Machiavelli was the first modern thinker to have thought of the State as an independent entity and not recognising any religious organisation exterior to it and The Prince has been a choice of several political leaders such as Louis XIV, Napoleon Bonaparte and Benito Mussolini. <nl><nl>The modern state was \u2018constituted by an abstraction from personal to impersonal rule\u2019 (Mansfield, 1983). With Machiavelli we encounter a challenge to the classical regime which is expressed in his use of stato (his stato is someone\u2019s to acquire), whereas for Aristotle\u2019s regime there is some ordering of the inhabitants of the city. The central theme of Machiavelli\u2019s political ideas is power with absolute state being the end. The state is viewed as superior to all associations and is sovereign as well as autonomous however he also stated that religion cannot influence politics and the church cannot control the state, which is not the case. <nl><nl>Comparing Machiavelli to other theorists allows for us to critically evaluate him further. Plato had the vision of every human being born into a division which was maintained and creating an arrangement for the state in the course of classism whereas Machiavelli proposed with the aim of sovereignty to support the nation in which the leader controls and protects its citizens. Machiavelli\u2019s concept of virt\u00fa highlights the utilitarian needs of the country. For Machiavelli virt\u00fa outweighs virtue in times of need whilst Plato believes a \u2018just ruler must behave the same at all times\u2019 however we have to consider they were writing in different eras, as Plato\u2019s philosophy is based on utopian principles and Machiavelli is viewed as a realist (Abrams, M, 2017). Aristotle divides government into two categories: good and bad with good forms fall aristocracy and under bad fall oligarchy. Aristotle wanted to help society achieve goodness through politics whereas on the other hand Machiavelli sought to achieve the maintenance of power and stability. They have differing views in terms of Aristotle claimed that if an entire state is made to fear their ruler, this would cause unhappiness however Machiavelli suggested that it is better to be feared than loved as it creates balance. However, they are on similar sides when it comes to liberation, as in the Prince it stated such ruler should not dictate the actions of others, but all together Machiavelli was seeking a practical type of politics whilst Aristotle took a rather idealistic approach (Tabone, 2020).  <nl><nl>Hobbes and Machiavelli have fascinating ideas on human nature impacting the state as the common theme is the usage of fear, meaning power needs to be acquired and maintained but we have to remember that Machiavelli\u2019s time period involved the peak of absolutism and hierarchies. Philosophers such a John Locke have directly opposing views on government. Locke\u2019s perception of revolt as a right gave people excessive power compared to the government, this did not exist during the time of Machiavelli. Locke believed in the idea of the government working for the people, however this is directly opposed to Machiavelli\u2019s thought that the ruler should do what it takes to remain in power (Chris Joseph, 2014). Machiavelli recommended that coercion should be used in order to govern whereas Locke favoured a social contract with the concept of dual accountability. Although Machiavelli\u2019s concept of coercion is flawed, he did recognise that rulers could not govern by this alone and advocated for the use of cunning and subterfuge, Locke\u2019s social contract did not contain an element of this. Machiavelli had a pessimistic view of individuals and believed human beings are fundamentally bad whereas Locke was more optimistic. In the modern state it follows Machiavelli\u2019s model more as the rulers in the modern state are comprised of the rich and powerful in society. Mill and Machiavelli also have the same solution to government in freedom of speech, they are both aware that people cannot have a hand in ruling itself. <nl><nl>Political leaders and their followers believed that Machiavellism was a disease infesting the politic body. He is still regarded with a negative reputation, but he still aids us to understand the modern state. Machiavelli promoted the central role of a citizen in preserving institutions which is reflected through the meaning of the Second Amendment in the U.S. Constitution (Bernard, 2009). Among modern believers of Machiavelli, there are Burmese generals such as Web Jiabao, the Former Premier of China and Lord Mandelson (Bernard, 2009). Machiavelli and Pareto agree in terms of this where they say egotism or selfishness as a natural property of the human species (Femia, 2013). According to Machiavellism though, the principle aim of prince is the unification as well as welfare of the state which showed reality of practical politics. He deduced that the internal unity and powerful government were the essential of any state by observing the affairs of the interstate rivalries. The sole aim of the prince is also to increase power in ways such as to be an expert in managing and organising a war- power is seen as the only reason of the state. <nl><nl>To conclude Machiavelli contributes to the \u2018comprehension of constituent power as a living force within social order\u2019 (Lucchese, 2016). He developed a revolutionary position, suggesting that political conflict is not a destabilising factor, but rather the grounding force of free republics. His concepts and ideas are often misunderstood as he displayed rare intellect to become a partisan in an age where absolute monarchy held control (Mathur, 1991). All together Machiavelli was the first thinker who justified secular state and the first advocate for autonomy for the state. He unfairly became associated with evil through his critical work written about The Prince, and although it did not get translated until almost a hundred years later the negative view about Machiavelli had already been established into Elizabethan England. All together he communicated priority to the state and put it above morality and religion as it is the highest form of social organisation and most essential to promote human welfare, and this is seen clearly in the modern state. Machiavelli\u2019s Prince dealt exclusively with the interests of a single person of power that focuses on only the leader\u2019s welfare in mind whereas the theories of Plato, Aristotle, Locke and Mill dealt with the welfare of society. However, in the modern state there Machiavelli did consider that the Prince needed to maintain good relations with the people which is what we observe. It can be agreed the way that Machiavelli talks about the state as Machiavelli was a realist.", "<unintelligible>  might make it tonight for dinner.<new>My favourite restaurant. Oh, gosh. It would have to be, I\u2019ve been to so many lately. It was that August, Eat Out to Help Out scheme. I just tried every and any restaurant, it was awful. It would have to be  <restaurant1> , which is near, a restaurant, a Thai restaurant near where I live. We went there for my dad\u2019s fiftieth when restaurants were open. And my favourite dish there, they do these lamb skewers erm, but with a like a honey sauce that I didn\u2019t think the two originally went good together but I had to order like  <unintelligible>  of those starters, it was really bad. Like I sat there, oh it was so bad, just like dunking the skewers into the, erm, honey sauce. That was amazing. And then, the prawn toast in the sweet chilli sauce. And I think I had red Thai curry, red Thai curry but with, erm, chicken and fish, which is weird because usually we\u2019d have it just with chicken but I had it with chicken and fish this time and I would have to, I\u2019m just patiently waiting for restaurants to open so I can go, go and  <laugh>  get that again. But that was prob-, that\u2019s probably my go to meal, wherever I go, I\u2019m going to try red Thai curry.<new>Oh gosh, this is\u2026 special meal I ever had? It would probably be when my friend and I, we both, erm, had some really successful achievements. So, we decided to go all out and go out to celebrate. And we ended up going to  <restaurant2> . So, that would probably. And the food there, as ridiculously expensive as it was, actually, that was probably one of my most special meals just because, you know, when you sit down and you don\u2019t have anything to stress about when you\u2019re eating your food? Like, there\u2019s like, you\u2019ve just done something amazing, it\u2019s about time you go and enjoy. So, yeah, I think at  <restaurant2> , I had, what did I have? I think I had a prawn curry with rice and that was really nice. And I also had like a lamb steak sort of thing that was really good. But that, I think that was my most special meal. Just because I, we all used to think the price that you pay for  <restaurant2> , surely, like the food can\u2019t be that good? And it was, a hundred, a hundred percent was, like I would go back again and this time not have a budget and just  <laugh>  try some, try more than I did before. But yeah, that\u2019s maybe one of my special meals."]}

Thai food or, I would say Thai food, Chinese or American soul. It literally depends on my mood. So, Thai food, red Thai curry, the spicier the better, whereas you can also have prawn toast. I think prawn toast is more of a Chinese sort of thing but that, I love Chinese cuisine as well, Singapore fried rice. And then you have American soul food. So, that\u2019s like the hefty like burgers where it\u2019s just, it looks dirty like you have the chicken, bacon, everything  <unintelligible>  and the mash and peas and then the milkshakes and the fries. So, oh, it makes me hungry now  <laugh> . But yeah, erm, that would, those\u2019d probably be my favourite cuisines but. Because I can\u2019t make it at home, I can only eat it out. So yeah, it\u2019s more finding the best places that do those cuisines and then experimenting. But yeah, those are my favourite, I would think.<new>My favourite dish to cook would probably be  <unintelligible> , let\u2019s say than vegetarian than vegie lasagne. So, instead of the minced meat, in my family we use aubergine, courgettes, peppers. Mm, er, I make a  <unintelligible>  I make one in cheese sauce and like the tomato sauce and then we have like pasta sheets. So yeah, that would be my favourite meal to, probably, cook, that with garlic bread. But, obviously, if I\u2019m at uni, I\u2019d be doing, because I don\u2019t eat beef either, I would mix that up with, erm, turkey mince, which is a really, or lamb mince, which is a really good alternative. Apart from that, I would probably also say tacos. Tacos are my favourite to make but instead of, obviously, using beef, like I only, erm, would use black beans. So like, erm, that\u2019s really nice. And then we make our own guacamole and it\u2019s like with, ah, I love that too. Yeah, those are like my two favourite things to make.<new>Okay, yeah, sure. So, with the lasagne, I\u2019d say the lasagne\u2019s definitely the more complicated one, we start off by so, you obviously chop your aubergines, courgettes, peppers, chop them all, may, preferably into slices. And then we roast but whilst we roast, we add like our oil. So, I use chilli oil just because I like mine spicy. And yeah, so we roast. We have like a sort of grill thing so we let it roast for quite some time till all the vegetables like shrink. So, it\u2019s like aubergine goes like a really browny colour. But yeah, so we do that. I add on seasoning so salt, pepper, chilli powder. We add turmeric, erm, cumin. Oh gosh, what else do we add? Yeah, just th-those are the standard spices is what we add. Leave that to the side but like still ha-, keep it on low heat. And then we make the cheese sauce, which would be  <unintelligible> . Okay, so it\u2019s m-, butter and milk first, let it come to a simmer. Then add your two tablespoons of flour and then add, wait till it comes to a boi-, erm, comes to a boil? Yeah, so, when it starts bubbling, then you add all your cheese and I use like two hundred to three hundred grams of cheese just bec-, I like, er, I have this weird obsession with cheese. And, erm, yeah, so  <unintelligible>  that all in, you\u2019ve made your cheese sauce. Now, for the tomato sauce, we use tomato paste. We use a little bit of yoghurt, which isn\u2019t usually done in lasagne anyways but my family just like it like that. So, it\u2019s, erm, tomato paste and then also tinned tomatoes together. We add our seasonings into that as well, mostly chilli powder. We also use taco seasoning,  like the yea-, seasoning in our, erm, tomato sauce. I don\u2019t know why we do that. Then we add like a few, mm, diced peppers and stuff just to add some texture into the sauce. And then lastly, we have like the lasagne sheets. So, we don\u2019t make our own. I\u2019ve been trying to convince my family to buy a pasta machine but these guys don\u2019t want to listen to me. So, so, we get the ones where, erm, they\u2019re quite dry at first but you\u2019re meant to just put them into the baking tray but we don\u2019t do that. We, like a large bowl, fill that up with boiling water, let the pasta sheets soak in there until they\u2019re kind of soggy. But you\u2019re not mea-, you\u2019re not meant to do that but we do it anyway just because we\u2019re re-really scared that it\u2019s not going to cook. So then, each layer, so we put the, soak the pasta sheets, probably use a fork to like keep it dunked under the water, otherwise it sinks above. And then we have this huge lasagne like plate, I guess, and then we layer it. So, it goes pasta sheets, vegetables, tomato sauce, cheese sauce, another layer of pasta sheets and then we keep going in that consecutive order. And then at the top, we just add the cheese sauce all over it. Then the tomato goes on top. So, we do it in a different order. And then we just put a lot of like grated cheddar cheese on top. And then leave it in the oven for thirty to forty minutes until the top\u2019s all brown, take it out. By then the oven\u2019s hot so we use ready-made garlic bread and leave that in the oven for like eight to ten minutes and then by then, that\u2019s our meal completely done.", "I have attached my CV<nl>My contact number is <phone_number><nl>Thank you and have a pleasant day<new>I was just wondering as someone who has wanted to go to <unviersity> for a while, would having 3 A*s, 6 A's and a B at GCSE put me at a large disadvantage with other competitors?

{"id": "0f161cc4-7b8a-4654-9e43-7253f9e3f5e8", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>What is religion? Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961). This definition further criticizes religion as something which individuals turn to out of worry and desperation.<nl>In addition to the functional definitions of religion which can be seen above, there is also the substantive definition of religion which can be investigated. Substantive definitions tend to define religion in terms of its content rather than its function. Here, it is common for the existence of a \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018supernatural being\u2019 to be present when defining religion. This can be seen in Roland Robertsons definition of religion, where he states that \u2018religion refers to the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life\u2019 (Robertson, 1970). Such definitions however, can be seen as problematic to the wider community. This definition of religion by Robertson, clearly necessitates the existence of a god, and rejects any ideas that do not have a \u2018god\u2019 at the centre of their ideology to be classed as religion. This would not allow for beliefs such as Buddhism to be categorised as a religion, due to the fact that it is not based upon the concept of a creator- God (Gethin, 1998). Robertson\u2019s view on religion is supported by Max Weber, who also uses a substantive concept of religion, seeing it as a belief in a divine entity which cannot be explained scientifically (Weber, 2009). In other words, the belief in a god is required for a concept to be deemed as a religion. Ronald Dworkin however, opposes this notion and states that \u2018religion, does not necessarily mean a belief in god\u2019 and \u2018religion is an interpretive concept\u2019 (Dworkin, 2013). Dworkins use of the word \u2018interpretive\u2019, infers that religion can have a different meaning, dependent on the individual. Buddhism has now been linked to the global category of a world religion (McMahan, 2012), causing much debate upon what constitutes religion. This begs the question, who has set the requirements for what can and cannot be defined as a religion? Who has the right to dictate this? As Aldridge states \u2018Defining religion involves an exercise of power\u2019 (Aldridge, 2007).<nl><nl>Religion in International Relations- Post Secularization and Foreign Policy <nl>Often, when analysing religion within the international relations scene it can be deemed an aspect which is hastily overlooked. Religion is rarely included in most major theories of international relations and this can be ascribed to major Western social thinkers rejecting the notion of religion (Fox and Sandler, 2004), as discussed previously. As a particular scholar illustrated , \u2018the role of religion in explaining attitudes toward issues of international relations is somewhat limited\u2019 (Jelen, 1994). However, when further analysing international relations and conflict, it is clear that religion can be seen as a crucial element which should not be disregarded. It has been said that \u2018Domestic conflicts, including religious conflicts are becoming increasingly international issues\u2019 (Fox and Sandler, 2004). This extract from \u2018Bringing religion into International Relations\u2019, further emphasis the vital role that religion can play when assessing international relations. Examples of conflict which involve religion are The Israel Palestine conflict and the Thirty Years war. Here, religion can be key in resolving and understanding the clash, possibly presenting a recourse. <nl>Post secularization, it has been noted that a global resurgence of religion is transforming our understanding of international relations (Thomas, 2005). As there has been an increase in religious actors, it has recently become a vital analytical focus (Haynes,2005). These religious actors can include examples such as foreign policy taking into account religion, as well as transnational factors. The more that religion begins to play a pivotal role in making country decisions, the more clarity there is on what a substantial role religion plays on the international scene. There has previously been a narrative which has pushed the notion that the term \u2018religion\u2019 carries negative connotations and only leads to tension and ferocity, bringing nothing of substance to the international relations division. This adheres to the \u2018Westphalian presumption\u2019, which holds that \u2018religious and cultural pluralism cannot be accommodated in international public life\u2019 (Thomas, 2005). In other words, faith must be conceived as an internal matter to the sovereign state in order to avoid the risk of potential religious wars. This has encouraged using scientific knowledge and clear reasoning as justification for decisions over religion. It is clear that during these strongly secular times, there wasn\u2019t a want to define the term \u2018religion\u2019 from an international perspective. However, as religion began to make a return to the international scene, events such as 911 and Samuel Huntingtons\u2019 famous \u2018The clash of civilizations?\u2019 thesis (Huntington, 2000), only drew more attention to the importance of religion on the international relations front. As there was deemed to be a rise in religious clash and issues, with pivotal events such as 911, the topic of religion had to be assessed on the international scale. <nl>Many would also agree that religion has an important role to play in creating and shaping beliefs, which may in turn influence the formulation of state policy and foreign policy considerations. An instance of this can be seen with President George W. Bush, where he referred to the US having a \u2018calling\u2019 and \u2018mission\u2019 by the \u2018Maker of heaven\u2019 in his speeches on Foreign Policy (Judis, 2005). Not only can it be inferred here that George Bush is attempting to appeal to his majority audience with his \u2018faithful\u2019 language, but his references to God here explain how religion has had a direct impact on the foreign policy choices made. Bush\u2019s choice of language and rhetoric is extremely influential in shaping perspectives of the US citizens opinions on foreign policy. It was found here that there was a clear link between religion and opinion on U.S foreign policy in the Middle East (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). In particular, Evangelical Christians are more supportive of Bush\u2019s Foreign policy on the Iraq war and his foreign policy in general (Pew Research Centre, 2020). In a specific study carried out by Pew Research Centre, even after adjusting for the identity of the respondents groups, the impact of Evangelical beliefs towards foreign policy towards the Middle East remained statistically important (Pew Research Centre, 2020). These results are significant as they provide confirmatory proof that the position of Evangelical affiliation in shaping public opinion on foreign policy is important. It is also fundamental in understanding what a large effect a single religious group can have on how a country is run. The Middle East and President George Bush are a great area of focus due to the Iraq war being a matter which has concerned wide-spread public opinion since 2003 (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). As Boyer stated \u2018For many believers in biblical prophecy, the Bush administration\u2019s go-it-alone foreign policy, hands-off attitude toward the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and proposed war on Iraq, are not simply actions in the national self-interest or an extension of the war on terrorism, but part of an unfolding divine plan\u2019 (Boyer, 2003). This quote highlights how it is recognised that many individuals feel as though these conflicts directly involve religion and god, not only country policy. This infers that individuals will use faith as a major indicator when deciding their stance on subjects such as the Iraq war and foreign policy. On the contrary, research from the Pew Research centre suggests that people feel as though their faith does not define their opinion on the Iraq War (Different Faiths, Different Messages, 2020). Either way, the fact that there is much debate around religion probes several questions on the topic of faith, making it a valid matter when discussing international relations. As religion is increasingly being used for justification as well as indication, it is an important matter to consider on the international scene. \u00a8<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, when looking at definitions of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the context of both Sociology and International relations, it is obvious that there is much debate around what the word entails and its specific effects on society, good or bad. It is clear however, that religion has played a large role in shaping and moulding the current societies that we live in today, as well as the international relations scene, be it secular or not. Although there may be much debate upon whether the consequences of religion are \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 and \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019, the simple fact that decisions have and are being made based upon this, make it a crucial element that must be taken into consideration when looking at both society and international relations. There is no doubt that further research in the field of religion is vital and needed in order for a wider understanding of religion and its impact in both contexts.", "Favourite cuisine. Erm, I'm not really sure I have one but, mm, I\u2019ve recently got into, erm, Chinese food recently, recently. But erm, what\u2019s my favourite cuisine? I don\u2019t really have one, I\u2019ll just I like a mixture of things.<new>Erm, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just quite different and it\u2019s not the typical, erm, yeah, potatoes or steak or fries or whatever. It\u2019s just a different sort of, like a whole different country, different culture, different taste, different flavours. So, but, erm, something like dumplings, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have it on a normal day in your house. So, if I had that. And then yeah, you could go to the basic stuff like, er, egg fried rice or chicken fried rice, king prawn fried rice but, yeah, just different culture, I\u2019d say.<new>Oh, my favourite dish to cook. Erm, I mean, I can cook but I wouldn\u2019t say I'm the  <chef>  of the house  <laugh> . So, there\u2019s not much of a, a range to pick from. But erm, I would say, I can make my own roasts quite well, actually, er.<new>Yeah.<new><laugh> , okay. So, erm, it starts by getting your King Edward potatoes in. They usually have a bit of a red tint to them on the outside. So, then you just wash the potatoes, peel them, er, put a bit of salt, a bit of herbs on them, you know, cut them up, er, mix it all together. Then that\u2019s the potatoes done. And a trick my mum taught me is that you can boil the potatoes for a bit before you put them in the oven, which makes them all fluffy and actually cooks them quicker. So yeah, you season it all up and then I actually boil it. Then you put it into the oven and then that\u2019s the potatoes done. Then you get the sausages out of the pack, er, place it on a tray on the foil, put it inside the oven. Then the gravy, it\u2019s, it looks simple but it\u2019s actually kind of hard to make because if you get it too thick, like you\u2019re just eating slob. And if it\u2019s too thin, it\u2019s just water. So, you\u2019ve just got to, as you\u2019re pouring in the hot water, pour in the gra-, the granules at the same time and mix it consistently, otherwise, if you get lumps or it gets all thin, it\u2019s not really going to taste the best. So, whilst you\u2019re doing all of that, the ovens and the sausages are inside. So, erm, really and truly, when you\u2019re making the gravy, you\u2019re practically done. And then, obviously, you\u2019re boiling up all the carrots, the broccolis and then you plate up and you\u2019re done."]}

Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}

Due to contralateral processing, P3 should remain inattentive when shown a stimuli on the left. By using EEG, alpha activity can be recorded when shown a stimuli cued left or cued right. Event markers allow for it to be clear when the participant is shown the stimuli, and the alpha activity was recorded. The results showed that there was a significantly higher in left than right cue condition, and supported the hypothesis.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha activity refers to electrical impulses oscillating at 8-13Hz , this is an alpha wave. These brain waves begin in the cerebral cortex (Moini &amp; Piran, 2020) and occur during periods of inattention, where one is in a restful state, whilst being awake, examples of this is when closing eyes, meditating (Lagopoulos et al., 2009), daydreaming etc.  When the brain begins to focus on stimuli, alpha waves are suppressed. The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007), proposes that high alpha indicates disengagement and inhibition of task irrelevant brain areas. In task relevant brain areas, alpha remains low, supporting that alpha activity is modulated by attention.  <nl><nl>This hypothesis is supported by Magosso et al, 2019, which used a regular setting and a VR (virtual reality) setting to see if the intensity of the task and the levels of attention required affects alpha frequency. The results showed that alpha signals are suppressed when having to give attention to tasks although it seems that when isolated from all external features (when participating in VR) alpha activity becomes greater. This suggests that it is the modulation and diversion of attention which causes changes in alpha frequencies.<nl><nl>Sauseng et al (2005) presented participants with directional cues indicating which hemifield the target stimuli would appear in. The target stimuli consisted of either small or large bars which participants identified and responded with \u2018s\u2019 for small and \u2018l\u2019 for large. Results showed that there was stronger alpha frequency suppression in brain areas contralateral to the targeted hemifield. This is due to visual stimuli being processed contralaterally. 200ms before the stimuli was presented, in active processing areas like the parietal lobe (P3), the alpha range is also lower. This study is supportive of AIM (Klimesch et al, 2007), and is used as the basis for this experiment, as it is a partial replication. In this experiment, the focus will be on the effect of arrow cues, specifically the direction they are facing.<nl><nl>Hypothesis<nl>As AIH states, alpha range activity is present in areas that are uninvolved in active processing and is suppressed in areas that actively process. By directing attention, and cueing the participant to expect the stimuli in a specific region they will begin paying attention. As shown by Sauseng et al (2005), visual stimuli is processed contralaterally resulting in alpha suppression in the other side of the brain. For example, if the stimuli is present in the left visual field it will be processed by the right hemisphere. By using the left parietal cortex (P3) to record alpha activity, it is expected that alpha activity will be greater when a stimulus is shown on the left and for this activity to be suppressed when the stimuli is on the right.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 undergraduate students were participants chosen from an opportunity sample.<nl><nl>Design<nl>This experiment uses a within subjects design.

From the \u2018analog\u2019 tab select Electroencaphagram (EEG)\u2019 \u20180.5-100Hz wnotch\u2019, so the 50Hz band is filtered out. Digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker.. The \u2018calculation\u2019 tab allowed alpha frequency to be recorded. Then select \u2018EEG alpha 8-13Hz\u2019 from the drop down list. The sampling rate was 1000Hz. The participant was then prepared to be attached to the EEG. The electrode sites were abraded with everi cream using a cotton bud, and then AC cream was put on the electrodes. The electrodes are placed using the 1020 system. The active electrode was placed on P3. Participants were then given a cued visual task. A fixation cross was cued at the centre of the screen for 34ms, followed by an arrow indicating where to focus attention, with a 50% chance of it being cued left or right. There was then an interval of 600-800ms followed by a fixation cross for the second time, finally the participant was shown the target stimuli for 50ms, either a large or small white bar against a black background.

Due to contralateral processing, P3 should remain inattentive when shown a stimuli on the left. By using EEG, alpha activity can be recorded when shown a stimuli cued left or cued right. Event markers allow for it to be clear when the participant is shown the stimuli, and the alpha activity was recorded. The results showed that there was a significantly higher in left than right cue condition, and supported the hypothesis.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha activity refers to electrical impulses oscillating at 8-13Hz , this is an alpha wave. These brain waves begin in the cerebral cortex (Moini &amp; Piran, 2020) and occur during periods of inattention, where one is in a restful state, whilst being awake, examples of this is when closing eyes, meditating (Lagopoulos et al., 2009), daydreaming etc.  When the brain begins to focus on stimuli, alpha waves are suppressed. The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007), proposes that high alpha indicates disengagement and inhibition of task irrelevant brain areas. In task relevant brain areas, alpha remains low, supporting that alpha activity is modulated by attention.  <nl><nl>This hypothesis is supported by Magosso et al, 2019, which used a regular setting and a VR (virtual reality) setting to see if the intensity of the task and the levels of attention required affects alpha frequency. The results showed that alpha signals are suppressed when having to give attention to tasks although it seems that when isolated from all external features (when participating in VR) alpha activity becomes greater. This suggests that it is the modulation and diversion of attention which causes changes in alpha frequencies.<nl><nl>Sauseng et al (2005) presented participants with directional cues indicating which hemifield the target stimuli would appear in. The target stimuli consisted of either small or large bars which participants identified and responded with \u2018s\u2019 for small and \u2018l\u2019 for large. Results showed that there was stronger alpha frequency suppression in brain areas contralateral to the targeted hemifield. This is due to visual stimuli being processed contralaterally. 200ms before the stimuli was presented, in active processing areas like the parietal lobe (P3), the alpha range is also lower. This study is supportive of AIM (Klimesch et al, 2007), and is used as the basis for this experiment, as it is a partial replication. In this experiment, the focus will be on the effect of arrow cues, specifically the direction they are facing.<nl><nl>Hypothesis<nl>As AIH states, alpha range activity is present in areas that are uninvolved in active processing and is suppressed in areas that actively process. By directing attention, and cueing the participant to expect the stimuli in a specific region they will begin paying attention. As shown by Sauseng et al (2005), visual stimuli is processed contralaterally resulting in alpha suppression in the other side of the brain. For example, if the stimuli is present in the left visual field it will be processed by the right hemisphere. By using the left parietal cortex (P3) to record alpha activity, it is expected that alpha activity will be greater when a stimulus is shown on the left and for this activity to be suppressed when the stimuli is on the right.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 undergraduate students were participants chosen from an opportunity sample.<nl><nl>Design<nl>This experiment uses a within subjects design. The dependent variable is the alpha range amplitudes (microvolts) on the left hand side of the parietal lobe (P3). The independent variable is the direction of the arrow cue, with two levels, left or right. <nl>Materials<nl>This experiment used a Biopac MP36 to collect data, EEG electrodes, AC Cream, Abrasive paste, PsychoPy to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device and stimuli (see figure 1). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG by opening the Biopac student lab. From the \u2018analog\u2019 tab select Electroencaphagram (EEG)\u2019 \u20180.5-100Hz wnotch\u2019, so the 50Hz band is filtered out. Digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker.. The \u2018calculation\u2019 tab allowed alpha frequency to be recorded. Then select \u2018EEG alpha 8-13Hz\u2019 from the drop down list. The sampling rate was 1000Hz. The participant was then prepared to be attached to the EEG. The electrode sites were abraded with everi cream using a cotton bud, and then AC cream was put on the electrodes. The electrodes are placed using the 1020 system. The active electrode was placed on P3. Participants were then given a cued visual task. A fixation cross was cued at the centre of the screen for 34ms, followed by an arrow indicating where to focus attention, with a 50% chance of it being cued left or right. There was then an interval of 600-800ms followed by a fixation cross for the second time, finally the participant was shown the target stimuli for 50ms, either a large or small white bar against a black background.

{"id": "136b4f45-d899-4d12-a70a-bd6e6ec6c678", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl><nl>With the average person in the UK spending 110 minutes on social media, it is inevitable that content displayed across these platforms impact and influence societal norms. The nature of social media aids the ability for societal norms to not only be fueled and accepted across various cultures but also enable this to occur at an accelerated pace. However, the media has been proven to impact self-evaluation in a negative way. For example, there are numerous studies looking at women\u2019s self-evaluation, comparing weight-esteem based on neutral images or ideal images (Brown, Novick, Lord, &amp; Richards, 1992); self-worth based on social comparison (Jones &amp; Buckingham, 2005) etc. Unfortunately, looking at the effects on self-worth in men is minimal. This may be due to the rhetoric that portrays men as emotionless and when any type of emotion is displayed, idioms and phrases like \u2018be a man\u2019 or \u2018stop being a baby\u2019 comes into play. Due to this societal norm, it may make it difficult for men to be able to find appropriate support online and on social media platforms when struggling with the negative impact these sites can have on self worth. It is more acceptable for women to seek help online however, there is less support for men. By researching further into the impacts social media has on men\u2019s self worth, it can enable men to feel more comfortable when facing these issues. The research can aid understanding of this and also result in this topic becoming less taboo, giving a better chance for men to talk freely about their experiences.<nl><nl>I have investigated men\u2019s self worth in the context of social media and my main research question is \u2018How do young men talk about self worth within the context of social media (18-25)?\u2019. My method of analysis is discourse analysis as it allows for in-depth analysis into not only my participant\u2019s language use to construct ideas but also intonation. The interview will take place over a \u2018Zoom\u2019 video call, therefore I am able to have a video recording of all my participants' answers. <nl><nl>AnalysisResults<nl><nl>Through annotating my transcript I was able to select prominent themes that were discussed by my participant in the interview. These themes are spoken of throughout the interview and appear multiple times, even in different questions. From my initial question (line 7) I was able to determine that my participant is an avid user of social media, using it for entertainment purposes as well as using various platforms. This ensures that the questions I ask are relevant to my participant and the answers reflect their social media usage. <nl><nl>Key themes that were discussed by my participant include \"the ideal man\", involving image, appearance and social status; also \"alternate reality\", discussing not only the falseness of social media but also the construction of one's image on social media platforms.<nl><nl>The Ideal Man<nl><nl>The idea of \u2018the ideal man\u2019 featured within my participants answers multiple times, with a construction of what they personally believe to be the ideal man. As opposed to referring to what my participant feels they should look like, my participant instead suggests what others \"should be looking for\" (line 174) in a man, for example, the ideal height \"6 foot 4, or over 6 foot\" (line 175),  the ideal body, having \"six packs\" (line 138), adequate facial hair \"beard\" (line 176) etc. This is a very specific portrayal of men, suggesting that this is a common image for men to hold and strive to achieve. Although men do have an idea of what the ideal body type is they are also aware that in general life, this may not always be the case, with my participant stating that \"It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of me. It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of anyone I know.\" (line 162-163) when asked if he felt represented by men on social media. However, despite this acknowledgement, my participant still felt uncomfortable for comparisons between the appearance of men on social media and himself. My participant used the phrase \"I\u2019d prefer just to leave it at that\" (lines 161 and 294) indicating that men do feel uncomfortable about discussing their appearance, which supports the taboo of men expressing self-doubt and lacking self worth and lowered confidence. This would explain why my participant referred to other people he knows whenever talking about personal appearance, in order to make his answer generalised as opposed to solely him as well as deflect the discomfort about the fact that he is not the ideal man by justifying it with the fact that most people do not look like that.

{"id": "4ca86821-894f-48b5-a747-4b44d0d7a80c01876", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl><nl>With the average person in the UK spending 110 minutes on social media, it is inevitable that content displayed across these platforms impact and influence societal norms. The nature of social media aids the ability for societal norms to not only be fueled and accepted across various cultures but also enable this to occur at an accelerated pace. However, the media has been proven to impact self-evaluation in a negative way. For example, there are numerous studies looking at women\u2019s self-evaluation, comparing weight-esteem based on neutral images or ideal images (Brown, Novick, Lord, &amp; Richards, 1992); self-worth based on social comparison (Jones &amp; Buckingham, 2005) etc. Unfortunately, looking at the effects on self-worth in men is minimal. This may be due to the rhetoric that portrays men as emotionless and when any type of emotion is displayed, idioms and phrases like \u2018be a man\u2019 or \u2018stop being a baby\u2019 comes into play. Due to this societal norm, it may make it difficult for men to be able to find appropriate support online and on social media platforms when struggling with the negative impact these sites can have on self worth. It is more acceptable for women to seek help online however, there is less support for men. By researching further into the impacts social media has on men\u2019s self worth, it can enable men to feel more comfortable when facing these issues. The research can aid understanding of this and also result in this topic becoming less taboo, giving a better chance for men to talk freely about their experiences.<nl><nl>I have investigated men\u2019s self worth in the context of social media and my main research question is \u2018How do young men talk about self worth within the context of social media (18-25)?\u2019. My method of analysis is discourse analysis as it allows for in-depth analysis into not only my participant\u2019s language use to construct ideas but also intonation. The interview will take place over a \u2018Zoom\u2019 video call, therefore I am able to have a video recording of all my participants' answers. <nl><nl>AnalysisResults<nl><nl>Through annotating my transcript I was able to select prominent themes that were discussed by my participant in the interview. These themes are spoken of throughout the interview and appear multiple times, even in different questions. From my initial question (line 7) I was able to determine that my participant is an avid user of social media, using it for entertainment purposes as well as using various platforms. This ensures that the questions I ask are relevant to my participant and the answers reflect their social media usage. <nl><nl>Key themes that were discussed by my participant include \"the ideal man\", involving image, appearance and social status; also \"alternate reality\", discussing not only the falseness of social media but also the construction of one's image on social media platforms.<nl><nl>The Ideal Man<nl><nl>The idea of \u2018the ideal man\u2019 featured within my participants answers multiple times, with a construction of what they personally believe to be the ideal man. As opposed to referring to what my participant feels they should look like, my participant instead suggests what others \"should be looking for\" (line 174) in a man, for example, the ideal height \"6 foot 4, or over 6 foot\" (line 175),  the ideal body, having \"six packs\" (line 138), adequate facial hair \"beard\" (line 176) etc. This is a very specific portrayal of men, suggesting that this is a common image for men to hold and strive to achieve. Although men do have an idea of what the ideal body type is they are also aware that in general life, this may not always be the case, with my participant stating that \"It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of me. It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of anyone I know.\" (line 162-163) when asked if he felt represented by men on social media. However, despite this acknowledgement, my participant still felt uncomfortable for comparisons between the appearance of men on social media and himself. My participant used the phrase \"I\u2019d prefer just to leave it at that\" (lines 161 and 294) indicating that men do feel uncomfortable about discussing their appearance, which supports the taboo of men expressing self-doubt and lacking self worth and lowered confidence. This would explain why my participant referred to other people he knows whenever talking about personal appearance, in order to make his answer generalised as opposed to solely him as well as deflect the discomfort about the fact that he is not the ideal man by justifying it with the fact that most people do not look like that. This is supported when he says \"I don\u2019t think many men would want to admit, especially among their peers, wouldn\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re not the ideal person.\" (lines 354-355) <nl><nl>In addition to the body image, a man\u2019s social status and financial status also seems to be prevalent when it comes to describing the \u2018ideal man\u2019 with my participant referring to men with \"seven figures\" (line 138), and men who have \"lavish\" (line 81 ) lifestyles. A given example was the actor and influencer \u2018Dan Bilzerian\u2019; well known for \"constantly flaunting a bunch of money\" (line 241) and \"constantly surrounded by money\". (line 242) This was someone who my participant would refer to as a \u2018role model\u2019 for most males. My participant also referred to the fact that \"men can be successful on social media without looking the greatest\" (line 225), due to their social and financial status. This is supported by the evolutionary psychology theory that women will desire men who are able to provide stability, in the forms of shelter, money, food etc. (Li, Li, Chan &amp; Zhang, 2016). This would explain that now in the digital age, men are able to attract attention with their wealth via social media through posting \"lavish\" (line 81) objects. As it is now commonplace for influencers to be posting this type of content, as my participant stated, \"ordinary people might look at that and think \u2018Well, that\u2019s not me\u2019.\"(line  So this becomes the new goals and the new norm.

So, it\u2019d probably be more like just being able to spend that money and going out and stuff as opposed to like my taste changing to where I just eat caviar and stuff \u2018cause I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t feel like, I don\u2019t feel like a lot of like expensive foods and stuff like, I don\u2019t\u2026 I guess if I, 'cause I\u2019ve never had them I wouldn\u2019t know but like maybe I\u2019d try that out more if I, if I had like a lot of money so, yeah.<new>I feel like before coronavirus, like I used the, like I did used to go and eat a lot more out 'cause, obviously, there\u2019s more stuff. But I feel like in terms of like takeaways and stuff, I feel like I\u2019ve been getting a lot more takeaway since lockdown. And I think it\u2019s just because it\u2019s like, \"Oh, I\u2019m not going anywhere, I\u2019m not spending money anywhere, I might as well just buy this takeaway.\" And it\u2019s like, it makes you happy like it sounds really bad but like it, like when I order food or like  <unintelligible>  or like order in  <unintelligible>  we\u2019re like wow, like, like this is our excitement for the week or whatever. So, I feel like I\u2019ve started ordering more. And then, erm, I feel like I\u2019ve gotten a lot more like, like lazy when it comes to cooking and a lot more lazy when it comes to eating because like if like 'cause I\u2019m at home at the moment so like when my mum doesn\u2019t cook, like I won\u2019t go out of my way to cook like. I feel like when I was at uni, I\u2019d be like, \"I have to cook for myself,\" so like I have to make food, like. But because I\u2019m home, I\u2019m like my mum\u2019s going to end up cooking at some point, like I\u2019ll just wait until she\u2019s made food, like. And then also, like, it\u2019s really bad but like, like if my mum doesn\u2019t call me down to eat now, I\u2019m, I just won\u2019t go downstairs and look for food, like I don\u2019t even  <laugh> . I just, I\u2019m at the point now where it\u2019s just like if there\u2019s food, I\u2019ll eat it. If not, it\u2019s fine, like I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not hungry. But I feel like it\u2019s also 'cause I\u2019m not like doing anything too, too active at the moment because like I\u2019ll go like for walks and stuff or I\u2019ll go for like\u2026 or, or like I\u2019ll do a workout at home but like it doesn\u2019t make me hungry the way like, you know like when you like are meeting people or like you\u2019ve been at uni all day or like just, you\u2019re just always active and doing something? I feel like that made me more hungry and like it gave me more like structure but like at the moment, like there\u2019s, I feel like there\u2019s not too much structure in my day so I just eat whenever I\u2019m hungry and I feel like I don\u2019t get that hungry. But like it is starting to get on people\u2019s nerves 'cause like my mum and my boyfriend are always on me 'cause they\u2019re like, \"Why aren\u2019t you eating? Like you should eat three meals a day, you should wake up and eat.\" And like, and I\u2019m like, \"I\u2019m, I just eat when I\u2019m hungry.\" And I feel like I hear what they\u2019re saying, I, I understand that like it\u2019s good to eat three meals a day and it\u2019s good to eat in the morning and whatnot.

Erm, she\u2019s wearing a leather black jacket and he\u2019s also g- holding a book. And I do believe there might be a third person in the picture but they\u2019re just out of the scene. So yeah, they\u2019re sitting on a, I think it\u2019s a red or sort of er, a rose type couch, and er, they\u2019ve got a glass coffee table in front of them. Er, the man\u2019s got a beard and, er, he\u2019s smiling quite a bit, with a green top under his black, er, inspector gadget jacket,  <laugh>  some people would say. Erm, he\u2019s wearing some, er, brown khaki trousers \u2013 no, brown trousers, yeah. And er, the lady\u2019s wearing some brown boots with red leggings, I would say. Erm, you can\u2019t really see it too caref- too well, but er, she\u2019s got some earrings I think, that are dangling. So er, yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it. So yeah, I would say they\u2019re, they\u2019re both students as well, because they\u2019ve got a book. And er, I don\u2019t know who the third character in the picture is as we can\u2019t really see, but we can just see one of his hands. But yeah. And there\u2019s a leaflet on the glass coffee table in front of them. And that\u2019s it for picture three."]}

There\u2019s one woman standing and one woman sitting. Erm, one woman\u2019s wearing a striped black and white tee shirt with black jeans and one\u2019s wearing a denim jacket. One of them seems to be laughing and is looking at someone else, whereas one of them is looking down. The woman standing is the one wearing the striped tee shirt. She\u2019s also got blonde hair and seems to be involved in something. She looks busy. The other woman has braids and she seems to be engaged in conversation with someone and is laughing. The second image has two men. One of them is wearing a t-s-, checked shirt and the other is wearing a floral tee shirt. The one wearing the floral tee shirt is looking at the man wearing the stripe, er, the checked shirt. The one wearing the checked shirt is looking at a laptop. The laptop is a MacBook and it\u2019s on a table. The background is spotty. Erm, the background is spotty. The laptop is on the table. They seem like they\u2019re doing some type of work but nothing too stressful because the one in the shirt is smiling and so is the one in the tee shirt.

And it looks so disgusting whilst he\u2019s making it. But like the f-, end product, like it looks amazing and it looks like it tastes really good. And the thing is like, erm, like, I, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not vegan or I\u2019m not vegetarian or anything but my boyfriend is. So, like, I feel bad whenever I\u2019m like eating like a burger or like something like that near him. Like he doesn\u2019t mind but like at the same time, I feel like, I feel bad so then like I\u2019ve been trying to, you know, like not be vegetarian but trying to eat a bit more like vegetarian. 'Cause not only is it like good for the environment and stuff like, a lot of people around me are vegetarian, so like my parents are vegetarian, like my boyfriend\u2019s vegetarian now, my, like a lot of my friends have become vegetarian as well. So, I feel like it would help. But like, I feel like I like meat a lot so having that would be amazing. And being able to make it I feel like would be, would be cool but like it\u2019s so weird like it just looks, it looks so tasty but at like at the same time, like I don\u2019t know how like I would find it or how I\u2019d make it. So, I think that\u2019s something I really want to try.<new>Oh, that would, yeah, I think, I think I\u2019d eat a bit more... because at the moment, I feel like  <laugh> , especially like as a student like I have to watch like what I\u2019m spending money on and I feel like when I s-, try and save money, I try and save on food more than anything when, because with drink, like, especially when like you\u2019re like, like now stuff\u2019s opening up and stuff and like you want to spend money on drinks and stuff. So, I would prioritise that like before my food so like I will go like, I remember like, I, it doesn\u2019t happen as much now because I\u2019ve been at home quite a lot because of, erm, like just out of ease and\u2026 but like in my first year, I used to eat like noodles all the time and my friends would be like, \"Yeah, we\u2019re eating this, like we\u2019ve prepped these meals,\" and I\u2019d be like, \"Yeah, no, that\u2019s not happening.\" But I feel like I\u2019d be able to, I\u2019d eat out a lot more than I do now and I feel like... I don\u2019t feel like my, like my taste would change as much as it would just be like I\u2019d eat out really  <laugh>  more and like I\u2019d probably end up drinking way more or like not having to drink like, when it comes to like, I feel like with like normal like drinks and stuff like it\u2019s fine but like when it comes to alcohol, like I feel like I do try and like choose the cheapest option and I feel like it\u2019s so easy to just like, to find expensive drinks that you do end up liking. So, like, I\u2019d probably end up spending like too much money on drinking like, mm. But the thing is like the more expensive alcohol is, I feel like it tastes better or like, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just me or like if it actually is or if it\u2019s just like a placebo type thing where it\u2019s like, \"Oh, it\u2019s more expensive so it tastes better.\" But I don\u2019t know, I feel like I\u2019d spend a lot of money on going out and drinking."]}

I'm writing this email on behalf of us all in regards to the maintenance of the house.<nl><nl>Firstly, the fridge has been a recurring problem. This is because from day one it has always been difficult to fully close it - partly due to the design of the cupboard door and the fact that the freezer isn\u2019t working properly and as a result the ice builds up and doesn\u2019t allow it to close. This further prevents the fridge from closing properly in addition to the cupboard design door. This ongoing issue has resulted in numerous amounts of food not being kept properly and the unfortunate throwing away of them. We are all experiencing hard times as we attempt to continue living with COVID19, therefore the continuous cycle of buying food and it going off due to a dysfucntional and ineffective fridge makes these times just that much harder.<nl><nl>A contractor was sent out once and the service he provided was not good enough as this is still a very important issue - if not the most important as it directly effects our health and safety.<nl><nl>Another issue in the kitchen is that one of the lower cabinet doors has come off. I believe the inside components have snapped and the repair will require new parts.<nl><nl>The last of the issues in the kitchen is the metal wall section behind the sink. The bottom part of it has opened and essentially began to peel off. This also needs to be fixed because if its allowed to continue peeling the wall behind it will start to get wet from the sink and cause further damage to the property.<nl><nl>In line with maintenance requests, it has also been brought to my attention that the top floor tenant is extremely unhappy with the mattress she is having to use as she says all she can feel is the springs within it. This causes severe joint and shoulder pain - again this is important as it has a direct impact on her health. If this could be replaced it would be most helpful, as we are timely paying tenants who don\u2019t believe this to be an unjust request.<nl><nl>I did contact the <business> property management mobile contact number ending 152, I was directed to report all maintenance issues through property file.

{"id": "7dac20fb-9761-4117-b89c-9a921885121f04903", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl><nl>With the average person in the UK spending 110 minutes on social media, it is inevitable that content displayed across these platforms impact and influence societal norms. The nature of social media aids the ability for societal norms to not only be fueled and accepted across various cultures but also enable this to occur at an accelerated pace. However, the media has been proven to impact self-evaluation in a negative way. For example, there are numerous studies looking at women\u2019s self-evaluation, comparing weight-esteem based on neutral images or ideal images (Brown, Novick, Lord, &amp; Richards, 1992); self-worth based on social comparison (Jones &amp; Buckingham, 2005) etc. Unfortunately, looking at the effects on self-worth in men is minimal. This may be due to the rhetoric that portrays men as emotionless and when any type of emotion is displayed, idioms and phrases like \u2018be a man\u2019 or \u2018stop being a baby\u2019 comes into play. Due to this societal norm, it may make it difficult for men to be able to find appropriate support online and on social media platforms when struggling with the negative impact these sites can have on self worth. It is more acceptable for women to seek help online however, there is less support for men. By researching further into the impacts social media has on men\u2019s self worth, it can enable men to feel more comfortable when facing these issues. The research can aid understanding of this and also result in this topic becoming less taboo, giving a better chance for men to talk freely about their experiences.<nl><nl>I have investigated men\u2019s self worth in the context of social media and my main research question is \u2018How do young men talk about self worth within the context of social media (18-25)?\u2019. My method of analysis is discourse analysis as it allows for in-depth analysis into not only my participant\u2019s language use to construct ideas but also intonation. The interview will take place over a \u2018Zoom\u2019 video call, therefore I am able to have a video recording of all my participants' answers. <nl><nl>AnalysisResults<nl><nl>Through annotating my transcript I was able to select prominent themes that were discussed by my participant in the interview. These themes are spoken of throughout the interview and appear multiple times, even in different questions. From my initial question (line 7) I was able to determine that my participant is an avid user of social media, using it for entertainment purposes as well as using various platforms. This ensures that the questions I ask are relevant to my participant and the answers reflect their social media usage. <nl><nl>Key themes that were discussed by my participant include \"the ideal man\", involving image, appearance and social status; also \"alternate reality\", discussing not only the falseness of social media but also the construction of one's image on social media platforms.<nl><nl>The Ideal Man<nl><nl>The idea of \u2018the ideal man\u2019 featured within my participants answers multiple times, with a construction of what they personally believe to be the ideal man. As opposed to referring to what my participant feels they should look like, my participant instead suggests what others \"should be looking for\" (line 174) in a man, for example, the ideal height \"6 foot 4, or over 6 foot\" (line 175),  the ideal body, having \"six packs\" (line 138), adequate facial hair \"beard\" (line 176) etc. This is a very specific portrayal of men, suggesting that this is a common image for men to hold and strive to achieve. Although men do have an idea of what the ideal body type is they are also aware that in general life, this may not always be the case, with my participant stating that \"It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of me. It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of anyone I know.\" (line 162-163) when asked if he felt represented by men on social media. However, despite this acknowledgement, my participant still felt uncomfortable for comparisons between the appearance of men on social media and himself. My participant used the phrase \"I\u2019d prefer just to leave it at that\" (lines 161 and 294) indicating that men do feel uncomfortable about discussing their appearance, which supports the taboo of men expressing self-doubt and lacking self worth and lowered confidence. This would explain why my participant referred to other people he knows whenever talking about personal appearance, in order to make his answer generalised as opposed to solely him as well as deflect the discomfort about the fact that he is not the ideal man by justifying it with the fact that most people do not look like that. This is supported when he says \"I don\u2019t think many men would want to admit, especially among their peers, wouldn\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re not the ideal person.\" (lines 354-355) <nl><nl>In addition to the body image, a man\u2019s social status and financial status also seems to be prevalent when it comes to describing the \u2018ideal man\u2019 with my participant referring to men with \"seven figures\" (line 138), and men who have \"lavish\" (line 81 ) lifestyles. A given example was the actor and influencer \u2018Dan Bilzerian\u2019; well known for \"constantly flaunting a bunch of money\" (line 241) and \"constantly surrounded by money\". (line 242) This was someone who my participant would refer to as a \u2018role model\u2019 for most males. My participant also referred to the fact that \"men can be successful on social media without looking the greatest\" (line 225), due to their social and financial status. This is supported by the evolutionary psychology theory that women will desire men who are able to provide stability, in the forms of shelter, money, food etc. (Li, Li, Chan &amp; Zhang, 2016). This would explain that now in the digital age, men are able to attract attention with their wealth via social media through posting \"lavish\" (line 81) objects. As it is now commonplace for influencers to be posting this type of content, as my participant stated, \"ordinary people might look at that and think \u2018Well, that\u2019s not me\u2019.\"(line  So this becomes the new goals and the new norm. It is evident that the fact that my participant did not relate to these standards, as when asked if he felt represented by these role models and depictions of men he stated \"No. No. No. No I don\u2019t.\" (line 156) Being unable to relate to the norm often results in incongruence between one's actual self and ideal self which may lower self worth. (Rogers, 1959).<nl><nl>My participant states that they have changed themselves in order to conform with these standards, however wished not to elaborate on how he changed. Instead he referred to people that he knew of, talking about there being  \"a lot of men that will spend a bunch of time at the gym to try and achieve the body that every man wants.\" (lines 347-348) This emphasises that the pressures displayed online and on social media affects men enough for them to wish to change their lifestyle in order to relate to these standards. <nl><nl>Alternate Reality<nl><nl>Throughout my participants answers he refers to the fact that social media is \"not a true depiction\" (line 60) , is a \"very, very fake place\" (lines 104, 71, 63), \"is quite a negative place\" (lines 70, 84) , is \"not real\" (line 107) , is \"very unhealthy\" (line 117), has \"bad sides\" (line 123), is \"the furthest thing from real life\" (lines 147-148) etc. This is common in all the answers, and is said in multiple different ways. My participant referred to social media in very negative ways, and suggested it is a \"toxic\" (line 136) place, despite spending around \"5 hours\" (line 15) per day. This is not an uncommon amount of time on social media, however spending this much time surrounded by something that is perceived as negative by my participant, it is unsurprising that his self confidence is impacted. Also, despite this awareness of the fact that not everything is quite what it seems on social media, the standards are still internalised. This suggests that regardless of the reality or the accuracy of the things that one may be exposed to, they are still accepted by people and becomes the societal norm. My participant also refers to the fact that women are more educated about the ways images are distorted online as opposed to enhancements and photoshop for men.  <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl><nl>From my research, it is evident that despite being aware of the falseness and unrealistic standards of social media, it is evident that young men\u2019s self worth is impacted negatively by the content they are exposed to on social media. Despite being adamant that they are aware of the one sidedness of social media, men continue to make comparisons and draw from this to bring into real life situations. This makes it clear that men experience lowered self confidence not only looks wise but also based on their financial status, social status and more materialistic things. My research has also made it clear that men also feel pressure, and more should be done in terms of support for men online. However, regardless of the gender, social media does tend to display only positive events, making it harder for regular people to accept other events and negative things in real life.", "dear dr. <addr7_SN><nl>I'm so so sorry but I forgot to hand in my homework and I just looked in my bag and my book is here but I've done it.

And they\u2019re both, you know, quite smiling a bit, so, erm. She\u2019s also, the teacher\u2019s also rolled their sleeves up, and she\u2019s got a black hairband on her right wrist, and she\u2019s let her blonde hair down.

Erm, you can\u2019t really see it too caref- too well, but er, she\u2019s got some earrings I think, that are dangling. So er, yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it.

And er, I don\u2019t know who the third character in the picture is as we can\u2019t really see, but we can just see one of his hands. But yeah.

So, I snack quite a bit more than actually cooking and eating, cooking and eating four meals, like I should be doing. So yeah, it\u2019s just due to the convenience, I would rather grab a snack than having to wait in the queues and all of that. And then actually dealing with getting to the shop and it\u2019s not there. So yeah, it\u2019s just made me snack a bit more, I would say."]}

I don\u2019t really have one, I\u2019ll just I like a mixture of things.<new>Erm, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just quite different and it\u2019s not the typical, erm, yeah, potatoes or steak or fries or whatever. It\u2019s just a different sort of, like a whole different country, different culture, different taste, different flavours. So, but, erm, something like dumplings, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have it on a normal day in your house. So, if I had that. And then yeah, you could go to the basic stuff like, er, egg fried rice or chicken fried rice, king prawn fried rice but, yeah, just different culture, I\u2019d say.<new>Oh, my favourite dish to cook. Erm, I mean, I can cook but I wouldn\u2019t say I'm the  <chef>  of the house  <laugh> . So, there\u2019s not much of a, a range to pick from. But erm, I would say, I can make my own roasts quite well, actually, er.<new>Yeah.<new><laugh> , okay. So, erm, it starts by getting your King Edward potatoes in. They usually have a bit of a red tint to them on the outside. So, then you just wash the potatoes, peel them, er, put a bit of salt, a bit of herbs on them, you know, cut them up, er, mix it all together. Then that\u2019s the potatoes done. And a trick my mum taught me is that you can boil the potatoes for a bit before you put them in the oven, which makes them all fluffy and actually cooks them quicker. So yeah, you season it all up and then I actually boil it. Then you put it into the oven and then that\u2019s the potatoes done. Then you get the sausages out of the pack, er, place it on a tray on the foil, put it inside the oven. Then the gravy, it\u2019s, it looks simple but it\u2019s actually kind of hard to make because if you get it too thick, like you\u2019re just eating slob. And if it\u2019s too thin, it\u2019s just water. So, you\u2019ve just got to, as you\u2019re pouring in the hot water, pour in the gra-, the granules at the same time and mix it consistently, otherwise, if you get lumps or it gets all thin, it\u2019s not really going to taste the best. So, whilst you\u2019re doing all of that, the ovens and the sausages are inside. So, erm, really and truly, when you\u2019re making the gravy, you\u2019re practically done. And then, obviously, you\u2019re boiling up all the carrots, the broccolis and then you plate up and you\u2019re done."]}

{"id": "9f438a50-d4dd-4705-a0e9-f174e7397fca07149", "discourse_types": ["essay", "speech_transcription"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl><nl>With the average person in the UK spending 110 minutes on social media, it is inevitable that content displayed across these platforms impact and influence societal norms. The nature of social media aids the ability for societal norms to not only be fueled and accepted across various cultures but also enable this to occur at an accelerated pace. However, the media has been proven to impact self-evaluation in a negative way. For example, there are numerous studies looking at women\u2019s self-evaluation, comparing weight-esteem based on neutral images or ideal images (Brown, Novick, Lord, &amp; Richards, 1992); self-worth based on social comparison (Jones &amp; Buckingham, 2005) etc. Unfortunately, looking at the effects on self-worth in men is minimal. This may be due to the rhetoric that portrays men as emotionless and when any type of emotion is displayed, idioms and phrases like \u2018be a man\u2019 or \u2018stop being a baby\u2019 comes into play. Due to this societal norm, it may make it difficult for men to be able to find appropriate support online and on social media platforms when struggling with the negative impact these sites can have on self worth. It is more acceptable for women to seek help online however, there is less support for men. By researching further into the impacts social media has on men\u2019s self worth, it can enable men to feel more comfortable when facing these issues. The research can aid understanding of this and also result in this topic becoming less taboo, giving a better chance for men to talk freely about their experiences.<nl><nl>I have investigated men\u2019s self worth in the context of social media and my main research question is \u2018How do young men talk about self worth within the context of social media (18-25)?\u2019. My method of analysis is discourse analysis as it allows for in-depth analysis into not only my participant\u2019s language use to construct ideas but also intonation. The interview will take place over a \u2018Zoom\u2019 video call, therefore I am able to have a video recording of all my participants' answers. <nl><nl>AnalysisResults<nl><nl>Through annotating my transcript I was able to select prominent themes that were discussed by my participant in the interview. These themes are spoken of throughout the interview and appear multiple times, even in different questions. From my initial question (line 7) I was able to determine that my participant is an avid user of social media, using it for entertainment purposes as well as using various platforms. This ensures that the questions I ask are relevant to my participant and the answers reflect their social media usage. <nl><nl>Key themes that were discussed by my participant include \"the ideal man\", involving image, appearance and social status; also \"alternate reality\", discussing not only the falseness of social media but also the construction of one's image on social media platforms.<nl><nl>The Ideal Man<nl><nl>The idea of \u2018the ideal man\u2019 featured within my participants answers multiple times, with a construction of what they personally believe to be the ideal man. As opposed to referring to what my participant feels they should look like, my participant instead suggests what others \"should be looking for\" (line 174) in a man, for example, the ideal height \"6 foot 4, or over 6 foot\" (line 175),  the ideal body, having \"six packs\" (line 138), adequate facial hair \"beard\" (line 176) etc. This is a very specific portrayal of men, suggesting that this is a common image for men to hold and strive to achieve. Although men do have an idea of what the ideal body type is they are also aware that in general life, this may not always be the case, with my participant stating that \"It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of me. It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of anyone I know.\" (line 162-163) when asked if he felt represented by men on social media. However, despite this acknowledgement, my participant still felt uncomfortable for comparisons between the appearance of men on social media and himself. My participant used the phrase \"I\u2019d prefer just to leave it at that\" (lines 161 and 294) indicating that men do feel uncomfortable about discussing their appearance, which supports the taboo of men expressing self-doubt and lacking self worth and lowered confidence. This would explain why my participant referred to other people he knows whenever talking about personal appearance, in order to make his answer generalised as opposed to solely him as well as deflect the discomfort about the fact that he is not the ideal man by justifying it with the fact that most people do not look like that. This is supported when he says \"I don\u2019t think many men would want to admit, especially among their peers, wouldn\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re not the ideal person.\" (lines 354-355) <nl><nl>In addition to the body image, a man\u2019s social status and financial status also seems to be prevalent when it comes to describing the \u2018ideal man\u2019 with my participant referring to men with \"seven figures\" (line 138), and men who have \"lavish\" (line 81 ) lifestyles. A given example was the actor and influencer \u2018Dan Bilzerian\u2019; well known for \"constantly flaunting a bunch of money\" (line 241) and \"constantly surrounded by money\". (line 242) This was someone who my participant would refer to as a \u2018role model\u2019 for most males. My participant also referred to the fact that \"men can be successful on social media without looking the greatest\" (line 225), due to their social and financial status. This is supported by the evolutionary psychology theory that women will desire men who are able to provide stability, in the forms of shelter, money, food etc. (Li, Li, Chan &amp; Zhang, 2016). This would explain that now in the digital age, men are able to attract attention with their wealth via social media through posting \"lavish\" (line 81) objects. As it is now commonplace for influencers to be posting this type of content, as my participant stated, \"ordinary people might look at that and think \u2018Well, that\u2019s not me\u2019.\"(line  So this becomes the new goals and the new norm. It is evident that the fact that my participant did not relate to these standards, as when asked if he felt represented by these role models and depictions of men he stated \"No. No. No. No I don\u2019t.\" (line 156) Being unable to relate to the norm often results in incongruence between one's actual self and ideal self which may lower self worth. (Rogers, 1959).<nl><nl>My participant states that they have changed themselves in order to conform with these standards, however wished not to elaborate on how he changed. Instead he referred to people that he knew of, talking about there being  \"a lot of men that will spend a bunch of time at the gym to try and achieve the body that every man wants.\" (lines 347-348) This emphasises that the pressures displayed online and on social media affects men enough for them to wish to change their lifestyle in order to relate to these standards. <nl><nl>Alternate Reality<nl><nl>Throughout my participants answers he refers to the fact that social media is \"not a true depiction\" (line 60) , is a \"very, very fake place\" (lines 104, 71, 63), \"is quite a negative place\" (lines 70, 84) , is \"not real\" (line 107) , is \"very unhealthy\" (line 117), has \"bad sides\" (line 123), is \"the furthest thing from real life\" (lines 147-148) etc. This is common in all the answers, and is said in multiple different ways. My participant referred to social media in very negative ways, and suggested it is a \"toxic\" (line 136) place, despite spending around \"5 hours\" (line 15) per day. This is not an uncommon amount of time on social media, however spending this much time surrounded by something that is perceived as negative by my participant, it is unsurprising that his self confidence is impacted. Also, despite this awareness of the fact that not everything is quite what it seems on social media, the standards are still internalised. This suggests that regardless of the reality or the accuracy of the things that one may be exposed to, they are still accepted by people and becomes the societal norm. My participant also refers to the fact that women are more educated about the ways images are distorted online as opposed to enhancements and photoshop for men.  <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl><nl>From my research, it is evident that despite being aware of the falseness and unrealistic standards of social media, it is evident that young men\u2019s self worth is impacted negatively by the content they are exposed to on social media. Despite being adamant that they are aware of the one sidedness of social media, men continue to make comparisons and draw from this to bring into real life situations. This makes it clear that men experience lowered self confidence not only looks wise but also based on their financial status, social status and more materialistic things. My research has also made it clear that men also feel pressure, and more should be done in terms of support for men online. However, regardless of the gender, social media does tend to display only positive events, making it harder for regular people to accept other events and negative things in real life.", "So, in the first picture, there\u2019s two women against a white background. There\u2019s one woman standing and one woman sitting. Erm, one woman\u2019s wearing a striped black and white tee shirt with black jeans and one\u2019s wearing a denim jacket. One of them seems to be laughing and is looking at someone else, whereas one of them is looking down. The woman standing is the one wearing the striped tee shirt. She\u2019s also got blonde hair and seems to be involved in something. She looks busy. The other woman has braids and she seems to be engaged in conversation with someone and is laughing. The second image has two men. One of them is wearing a t-s-, checked shirt and the other is wearing a floral tee shirt. The one wearing the floral tee shirt is looking at the man wearing the stripe, er, the checked shirt. The one wearing the checked shirt is looking at a laptop. The laptop is a MacBook and it\u2019s on a table. The background is spotty. Erm, the background is spotty. The laptop is on the table. They seem like they\u2019re doing some type of work but nothing too stressful because the one in the shirt is smiling and so is the one in the tee shirt. In the third image, two people are sitting next to each other. One\u2019s a woman and one\u2019s a man. They\u2019re both wearing jackets. The woman\u2019s wearing a bl-black leather jacket with a black tee shirt and red jeans with some boots. The man\u2019s wearing a grey jacket with a green tee shirt and brown trousers. The man is holding a book and they\u2019re both looking at the same person. You can see the person\u2019s hand in the corner. There\u2019s, in the background, there\u2019s more spots but they\u2019re in a circle. And they both seem happy because they\u2019re smiling."]}

I'm writing this email on behalf of us all in regards to the maintenance of the house.<nl><nl>Firstly, the fridge has been a recurring problem. This is because from day one it has always been difficult to fully close it - partly due to the design of the cupboard door and the fact that the freezer isn\u2019t working properly and as a result the ice builds up and doesn\u2019t allow it to close. This further prevents the fridge from closing properly in addition to the cupboard design door. This ongoing issue has resulted in numerous amounts of food not being kept properly and the unfortunate throwing away of them. We are all experiencing hard times as we attempt to continue living with COVID19, therefore the continuous cycle of buying food and it going off due to a dysfucntional and ineffective fridge makes these times just that much harder.<nl><nl>A contractor was sent out once and the service he provided was not good enough as this is still a very important issue - if not the most important as it directly effects our health and safety.<nl><nl>Another issue in the kitchen is that one of the lower cabinet doors has come off. I believe the inside components have snapped and the repair will require new parts.<nl><nl>The last of the issues in the kitchen is the metal wall section behind the sink. The bottom part of it has opened and essentially began to peel off. This also needs to be fixed because if its allowed to continue peeling the wall behind it will start to get wet from the sink and cause further damage to the property.<nl><nl>In line with maintenance requests, it has also been brought to my attention that the top floor tenant is extremely unhappy with the mattress she is having to use as she says all she can feel is the springs within it. This causes severe joint and shoulder pain - again this is important as it has a direct impact on her health. If this could be replaced it would be most helpful, as we are timely paying tenants who don\u2019t believe this to be an unjust request.<nl><nl>I did contact the <business> property management mobile contact number ending 152, I was directed to report all maintenance issues through property file. However, we were not given access to this platform and so can\u2019t use it.

Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}

{"id": "bdfbf2ca-ad12-47db-8291-2390fe2e956001386", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>What is religion? Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961). This definition further criticizes religion as something which individuals turn to out of worry and desperation.<nl>In addition to the functional definitions of religion which can be seen above, there is also the substantive definition of religion which can be investigated. Substantive definitions tend to define religion in terms of its content rather than its function. Here, it is common for the existence of a \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018supernatural being\u2019 to be present when defining religion. This can be seen in Roland Robertsons definition of religion, where he states that \u2018religion refers to the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life\u2019 (Robertson, 1970). Such definitions however, can be seen as problematic to the wider community. This definition of religion by Robertson, clearly necessitates the existence of a god, and rejects any ideas that do not have a \u2018god\u2019 at the centre of their ideology to be classed as religion. This would not allow for beliefs such as Buddhism to be categorised as a religion, due to the fact that it is not based upon the concept of a creator- God (Gethin, 1998). Robertson\u2019s view on religion is supported by Max Weber, who also uses a substantive concept of religion, seeing it as a belief in a divine entity which cannot be explained scientifically (Weber, 2009). In other words, the belief in a god is required for a concept to be deemed as a religion. Ronald Dworkin however, opposes this notion and states that \u2018religion, does not necessarily mean a belief in god\u2019 and \u2018religion is an interpretive concept\u2019 (Dworkin, 2013). Dworkins use of the word \u2018interpretive\u2019, infers that religion can have a different meaning, dependent on the individual. Buddhism has now been linked to the global category of a world religion (McMahan, 2012), causing much debate upon what constitutes religion. This begs the question, who has set the requirements for what can and cannot be defined as a religion? Who has the right to dictate this? As Aldridge states \u2018Defining religion involves an exercise of power\u2019 (Aldridge, 2007).<nl><nl>Religion in International Relations- Post Secularization and Foreign Policy <nl>Often, when analysing religion within the international relations scene it can be deemed an aspect which is hastily overlooked. Religion is rarely included in most major theories of international relations and this can be ascribed to major Western social thinkers rejecting the notion of religion (Fox and Sandler, 2004), as discussed previously. As a particular scholar illustrated , \u2018the role of religion in explaining attitudes toward issues of international relations is somewhat limited\u2019 (Jelen, 1994). However, when further analysing international relations and conflict, it is clear that religion can be seen as a crucial element which should not be disregarded. It has been said that \u2018Domestic conflicts, including religious conflicts are becoming increasingly international issues\u2019 (Fox and Sandler, 2004). This extract from \u2018Bringing religion into International Relations\u2019, further emphasis the vital role that religion can play when assessing international relations. Examples of conflict which involve religion are The Israel Palestine conflict and the Thirty Years war. Here, religion can be key in resolving and understanding the clash, possibly presenting a recourse. <nl>Post secularization, it has been noted that a global resurgence of religion is transforming our understanding of international relations (Thomas, 2005). As there has been an increase in religious actors, it has recently become a vital analytical focus (Haynes,2005). These religious actors can include examples such as foreign policy taking into account religion, as well as transnational factors. The more that religion begins to play a pivotal role in making country decisions, the more clarity there is on what a substantial role religion plays on the international scene. There has previously been a narrative which has pushed the notion that the term \u2018religion\u2019 carries negative connotations and only leads to tension and ferocity, bringing nothing of substance to the international relations division. This adheres to the \u2018Westphalian presumption\u2019, which holds that \u2018religious and cultural pluralism cannot be accommodated in international public life\u2019 (Thomas, 2005). In other words, faith must be conceived as an internal matter to the sovereign state in order to avoid the risk of potential religious wars. This has encouraged using scientific knowledge and clear reasoning as justification for decisions over religion. It is clear that during these strongly secular times, there wasn\u2019t a want to define the term \u2018religion\u2019 from an international perspective. However, as religion began to make a return to the international scene, events such as 911 and Samuel Huntingtons\u2019 famous \u2018The clash of civilizations?\u2019 thesis (Huntington, 2000), only drew more attention to the importance of religion on the international relations front. As there was deemed to be a rise in religious clash and issues, with pivotal events such as 911, the topic of religion had to be assessed on the international scale. <nl>Many would also agree that religion has an important role to play in creating and shaping beliefs, which may in turn influence the formulation of state policy and foreign policy considerations. An instance of this can be seen with President George W. Bush, where he referred to the US having a \u2018calling\u2019 and \u2018mission\u2019 by the \u2018Maker of heaven\u2019 in his speeches on Foreign Policy (Judis, 2005). Not only can it be inferred here that George Bush is attempting to appeal to his majority audience with his \u2018faithful\u2019 language, but his references to God here explain how religion has had a direct impact on the foreign policy choices made. Bush\u2019s choice of language and rhetoric is extremely influential in shaping perspectives of the US citizens opinions on foreign policy. It was found here that there was a clear link between religion and opinion on U.S foreign policy in the Middle East (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). In particular, Evangelical Christians are more supportive of Bush\u2019s Foreign policy on the Iraq war and his foreign policy in general (Pew Research Centre, 2020). In a specific study carried out by Pew Research Centre, even after adjusting for the identity of the respondents groups, the impact of Evangelical beliefs towards foreign policy towards the Middle East remained statistically important (Pew Research Centre, 2020). These results are significant as they provide confirmatory proof that the position of Evangelical affiliation in shaping public opinion on foreign policy is important. It is also fundamental in understanding what a large effect a single religious group can have on how a country is run. The Middle East and President George Bush are a great area of focus due to the Iraq war being a matter which has concerned wide-spread public opinion since 2003 (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). As Boyer stated \u2018For many believers in biblical prophecy, the Bush administration\u2019s go-it-alone foreign policy, hands-off attitude toward the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and proposed war on Iraq, are not simply actions in the national self-interest or an extension of the war on terrorism, but part of an unfolding divine plan\u2019 (Boyer, 2003). This quote highlights how it is recognised that many individuals feel as though these conflicts directly involve religion and god, not only country policy. This infers that individuals will use faith as a major indicator when deciding their stance on subjects such as the Iraq war and foreign policy. On the contrary, research from the Pew Research centre suggests that people feel as though their faith does not define their opinion on the Iraq War (Different Faiths, Different Messages, 2020). Either way, the fact that there is much debate around religion probes several questions on the topic of faith, making it a valid matter when discussing international relations. As religion is increasingly being used for justification as well as indication, it is an important matter to consider on the international scene. \u00a8<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, when looking at definitions of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the context of both Sociology and International relations, it is obvious that there is much debate around what the word entails and its specific effects on society, good or bad. It is clear however, that religion has played a large role in shaping and moulding the current societies that we live in today, as well as the international relations scene, be it secular or not. Although there may be much debate upon whether the consequences of religion are \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 and \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019, the simple fact that decisions have and are being made based upon this, make it a crucial element that must be taken into consideration when looking at both society and international relations.

Results showed that there was stronger alpha frequency suppression in brain areas contralateral to the targeted hemifield. This is due to visual stimuli being processed contralaterally. 200ms before the stimuli was presented, in active processing areas like the parietal lobe (P3), the alpha range is also lower. This study is supportive of AIM (Klimesch et al, 2007), and is used as the basis for this experiment, as it is a partial replication. In this experiment, the focus will be on the effect of arrow cues, specifically the direction they are facing.<nl><nl>Hypothesis<nl>As AIH states, alpha range activity is present in areas that are uninvolved in active processing and is suppressed in areas that actively process. By directing attention, and cueing the participant to expect the stimuli in a specific region they will begin paying attention. As shown by Sauseng et al (2005), visual stimuli is processed contralaterally resulting in alpha suppression in the other side of the brain. For example, if the stimuli is present in the left visual field it will be processed by the right hemisphere. By using the left parietal cortex (P3) to record alpha activity, it is expected that alpha activity will be greater when a stimulus is shown on the left and for this activity to be suppressed when the stimuli is on the right.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 undergraduate students were participants chosen from an opportunity sample.<nl><nl>Design<nl>This experiment uses a within subjects design. The dependent variable is the alpha range amplitudes (microvolts) on the left hand side of the parietal lobe (P3). The independent variable is the direction of the arrow cue, with two levels, left or right. <nl>Materials<nl>This experiment used a Biopac MP36 to collect data, EEG electrodes, AC Cream, Abrasive paste, PsychoPy to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device and stimuli (see figure 1). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG by opening the Biopac student lab. From the \u2018analog\u2019 tab select Electroencaphagram (EEG)\u2019 \u20180.5-100Hz wnotch\u2019, so the 50Hz band is filtered out. Digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker.. The \u2018calculation\u2019 tab allowed alpha frequency to be recorded. Then select \u2018EEG alpha 8-13Hz\u2019 from the drop down list. The sampling rate was 1000Hz. The participant was then prepared to be attached to the EEG. The electrode sites were abraded with everi cream using a cotton bud, and then AC cream was put on the electrodes. The electrodes are placed using the 1020 system. The active electrode was placed on P3. Participants were then given a cued visual task. A fixation cross was cued at the centre of the screen for 34ms, followed by an arrow indicating where to focus attention, with a 50% chance of it being cued left or right. There was then an interval of 600-800ms followed by a fixation cross for the second time, finally the participant was shown the target stimuli for 50ms, either a large or small white bar against a black background. Participants were then asked to use the keyboard to respond to the stimuli, typing either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. 75% of the trials were valid (the target stimuli was presented in the same hemifield that the arrow cue indicated), and 25% were invalid (the target stimuli was presented in the other hemifield). There were 20 blocks of the four trial types (cue left with a small bar, cue right with a small bar, cue left with a large bar and cue right with a large bar) so in total there were 80 trials.<nl><nl>Results<nl>There were transformations applied to the raw 9-13Hz alpha EEG data. There were eventmarkers received by PsychoPy through the Stimtracker, in order to identify when the stimuli was presented to the participants. The data also was used to specifically analyse from 200ms prior to stimulus onset after the directional arrow cues had been shown. Furthermore, the data was rectified, making negative values positive despite them showing excitatory or inhibitory activity. The samples were also averaged in order to limit the impact that outlying values would have on the data. This data is referred to as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl><nl>Descriptive Statistics<nl><table><nl><nl>Inferential Statistics <nl>The wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T=566, n=38, p=.002).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results of this experiment show that there was a significantly higher level of alpha activity when the stimulus was shown on the left hand side, this fit the original hypothesis. These results are consistent with AIH (Klimesch et al, 2007) as it shows that when participants are given a stimulus in their left hemifield, due to contralateral processing, this is processed by the right part of brain areas. As we were looking at P3, the left side of the parietal lobe, when shown a cue on the left it was processed on the right, meaning the left was task irrelevant and inattentive, resulting in higher alpha activity.<nl><nl>Methodological Problems<nl>Factors which may have confounded data include artefacts, which is when the EEG is contaminated by excess movement. When eye movements take place, the electrical activity could be recorded as brain activity. Eye movements could be blinking or horizontal eye movement, especially when having to look at either side of the screen. Blinking could also pose other issues such as the participant missing the cue. However, it does not seem to be too much of an issue and repetition and more trials would minimise the effects of this.<nl>Another issue could be the laboratory setting, as this could have an affect on brain activity. This is not a very normal situation for participants to be placed in so they may be uncomfortable or more alert as they know they are being studied. This could impact the EEG recordings as it is not a life-like situation so the results may not be generalisable to the whole population.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Overall, the data is valid despite minor methodological issues, which after replication can minimise the effect of individual differences, such as blinking and horizontal eye movement. The data also supports AIH and produced the expected results.", "Erm, I\u2019m going to say, the, I watched a, this video like, it was like a TikTok video or something and it, it was like, erm, this guy makes like, like vegan like chicken and stuff and like it\u2019s made out of like bread, like it\u2019s, he makes this bread, right and like he like washes out the starch and stuff.

So, I would prioritise that like before my food so like I will go like, I remember like, I, it doesn\u2019t happen as much now because I\u2019ve been at home quite a lot because of, erm, like just out of ease and\u2026 but like in my first year, I used to eat like noodles all the time and my friends would be like, \"Yeah, we\u2019re eating this, like we\u2019ve prepped these meals,\" and I\u2019d be like, \"Yeah, no, that\u2019s not happening.\" But I feel like I\u2019d be able to, I\u2019d eat out a lot more than I do now and I feel like... I don\u2019t feel like my, like my taste would change as much as it would just be like I\u2019d eat out really  <laugh>  more and like I\u2019d probably end up drinking way more or like not having to drink like, when it comes to like, I feel like with like normal like drinks and stuff like it\u2019s fine but like when it comes to alcohol, like I feel like I do try and like choose the cheapest option and I feel like it\u2019s so easy to just like, to find expensive drinks that you do end up liking. So, like, I\u2019d probably end up spending like too much money on drinking like, mm. But the thing is like the more expensive alcohol is, I feel like it tastes better or like, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just me or like if it actually is or if it\u2019s just like a placebo type thing where it\u2019s like, \"Oh, it\u2019s more expensive so it tastes better.\" But I don\u2019t know, I feel like I\u2019d spend a lot of money on going out and drinking."]}

There were 20 blocks of the four trial types (cue left with a small bar, cue right with a small bar, cue left with a large bar and cue right with a large bar) so in total there were 80 trials.<nl><nl>Results<nl>There were transformations applied to the raw 9-13Hz alpha EEG data. There were eventmarkers received by PsychoPy through the Stimtracker, in order to identify when the stimuli was presented to the participants. The data also was used to specifically analyse from 200ms prior to stimulus onset after the directional arrow cues had been shown. Furthermore, the data was rectified, making negative values positive despite them showing excitatory or inhibitory activity. The samples were also averaged in order to limit the impact that outlying values would have on the data. This data is referred to as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl><nl>Descriptive Statistics<nl><table><nl><nl>Inferential Statistics <nl>The wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T=566, n=38, p=.002).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results of this experiment show that there was a significantly higher level of alpha activity when the stimulus was shown on the left hand side, this fit the original hypothesis. These results are consistent with AIH (Klimesch et al, 2007) as it shows that when participants are given a stimulus in their left hemifield, due to contralateral processing, this is processed by the right part of brain areas. As we were looking at P3, the left side of the parietal lobe, when shown a cue on the left it was processed on the right, meaning the left was task irrelevant and inattentive, resulting in higher alpha activity.<nl><nl>Methodological Problems<nl>Factors which may have confounded data include artefacts, which is when the EEG is contaminated by excess movement. When eye movements take place, the electrical activity could be recorded as brain activity. Eye movements could be blinking or horizontal eye movement, especially when having to look at either side of the screen. Blinking could also pose other issues such as the participant missing the cue. However, it does not seem to be too much of an issue and repetition and more trials would minimise the effects of this.<nl>Another issue could be the laboratory setting, as this could have an affect on brain activity. This is not a very normal situation for participants to be placed in so they may be uncomfortable or more alert as they know they are being studied. This could impact the EEG recordings as it is not a life-like situation so the results may not be generalisable to the whole population.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Overall, the data is valid despite minor methodological issues, which after replication can minimise the effect of individual differences, such as blinking and horizontal eye movement. The data also supports AIH and produced the expected results.", "Hi it's <part_FN> I'm so sorry I'm a bit late, what room in <location> is your study<new>Hi, <nl>I've been trying to open the app and it just comes up with <nl><nl>'<copied_text>'<nl><nl><nl>I have attempted to redownload without any luck.<nl><nl>Thank you, <nl><part_FN><new>Dear <addr1_FN>, <nl>I apologise immensely for the delay in the response of this email, I have been at my grandma's house for the duration of the lockdown and unfortunately didn't have access to my laptop or wifi.

Erm, once I see the water\u2019s gone and there\u2019s not, like there\u2019s not much moisture left on the rice, I would then turn my heat completely low, erm, put a lid on and just wait for it to sort of steam, probably give it a mix after ten minutes or so and let it steam a bit more.

Erm, but, er, I think it\u2019s, it\u2019s good. You know, you\u2019re keeping yourself healthy and on your values you\u2019re not going to eat, erm, animal meats or whatever but, you know, I haven\u2019t really got a problem with it. I'm a, a bit indifferent to it.<new>Mm. I don\u2019t think they would change that much, really, yeah. But I think I would still eat the same sort of foods, maybe just go out to the restaurants a bit more. But apart from that, I wouldn\u2019t really transform from  <supermarket2>  chips to steak and chips at  <restaurant3>  or anything. So yeah. I think right now, I like my eating habits and, yeah, wouldn\u2019t really change it.<new>Erm, not necessarily because I\u2019ve actually been to quite a few anyway.

I don\u2019t really know a few that I can name but, yeah, let\u2019s just say restaurants in  <Country2> , for example. I\u2019ve never been there so yeah.<new>Er. I feel like I snack quite a lot more because, erm, I don\u2019t know, just going out nowadays, we are still in national lockdown and you know, when you go to the shops, the queues, the availability of the different foods, it\u2019s just everyone\u2019s more in their house. So, I snack quite a bit more than actually cooking and eating, cooking and eating four meals, like I should be doing. So yeah, it\u2019s just due to the convenience, I would rather grab a snack than having to wait in the queues and all of that.

There is one Black lady with braids, and one white lady with brown to blonde ombr\u00e9 hair. They look like they\u2019re in a work environment, as they\u2019re dressed fairly professionally. It looks as though the Black lady is- still she\u2019s sat down, and the white lady is stood up, possibly on a laptop. And they look, the Black lady looks surprised, so the white lady could be helping her with some work or something, and she looks shocked and surprised, but they both look happy and smiling. The stood, erm, the white lady who was standing up is wearing a black and white, erm, horizontal striped top, with black trousers and a black belt, with a black hairband on her wrist. And the Black lady who was sat down is wearing a long sleeve black top and a blue denim jacket. So that\u2019s the first picture. So on to the second picture. There\u2019s a picture of two males, one white and one Asian. So there is a white background but they seem to be sat on a black sofa with green, with a green circle pattern on it. The, erm, Asian boy is looking at a white Apple Mac laptop, and the white boy is looking at the Asian boy. Erm, the white boy is wearing a blue floral t-shirt, and the Asian boy is wearing a white crew neck top with a black and red shirt over the top. The laptop is sat on a circular wooden table. Erm, on to the third picture. So there is a Black lady and an Asian male who are both sat down in front of a low glass table. The background is quite interesting; black with, erm, some dot- with some white dots in a circular pattern. So the Black lady ha- is wearing a black top with a black leather jacket, burgundy trousers and brown boots. The Asian boy is wearing a green t-shirt with a grey and black coat. He is holding an open book and he\u2019s wearing beige bottoms with black trainers. They are both looking to the side and they both have a happy expression on their face. You can see someone else\u2019s hands in the picture, to the side that they\u2019re looking.

Erm, I'm not really sure I have one but, mm, I\u2019ve recently got into, erm, Chinese food recently, recently. But erm, what\u2019s my favourite cuisine? I don\u2019t really have one, I\u2019ll just I like a mixture of things.<new>Erm, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just quite different and it\u2019s not the typical, erm, yeah, potatoes or steak or fries or whatever. It\u2019s just a different sort of, like a whole different country, different culture, different taste, different flavours. So, but, erm, something like dumplings, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have it on a normal day in your house. So, if I had that. And then yeah, you could go to the basic stuff like, er, egg fried rice or chicken fried rice, king prawn fried rice but, yeah, just different culture, I\u2019d say.<new>Oh, my favourite dish to cook. Erm, I mean, I can cook but I wouldn\u2019t say I'm the  <chef>  of the house  <laugh> . So, there\u2019s not much of a, a range to pick from. But erm, I would say, I can make my own roasts quite well, actually, er.<new>Yeah.<new><laugh> , okay. So, erm, it starts by getting your King Edward potatoes in. They usually have a bit of a red tint to them on the outside. So, then you just wash the potatoes, peel them, er, put a bit of salt, a bit of herbs on them, you know, cut them up, er, mix it all together. Then that\u2019s the potatoes done. And a trick my mum taught me is that you can boil the potatoes for a bit before you put them in the oven, which makes them all fluffy and actually cooks them quicker. So yeah, you season it all up and then I actually boil it. Then you put it into the oven and then that\u2019s the potatoes done. Then you get the sausages out of the pack, er, place it on a tray on the foil, put it inside the oven. Then the gravy, it\u2019s, it looks simple but it\u2019s actually kind of hard to make because if you get it too thick, like you\u2019re just eating slob. And if it\u2019s too thin, it\u2019s just water. So, you\u2019ve just got to, as you\u2019re pouring in the hot water, pour in the gra-, the granules at the same time and mix it consistently, otherwise, if you get lumps or it gets all thin, it\u2019s not really going to taste the best. So, whilst you\u2019re doing all of that, the ovens and the sausages are inside. So, erm, really and truly, when you\u2019re making the gravy, you\u2019re practically done. And then, obviously, you\u2019re boiling up all the carrots, the broccolis and then you plate up and you\u2019re done."]}

So, I usually have, er, Maryland cookies or some type of random sweets or Twix or some type of candy or something and, er, usually with a Fanta on the side of it. So, I could wake up, go to the bathroom next door, brush my teeth and then come back, get a snack. So, that\u2019s just the start of the day as I'm just, you know, relaxing in my room. Then I\u2019ll go downstairs in about an hour or so, cook some breakfast so eggs, er, bread, beans, sausages and, you know, all the trimmings, bacon as well but I\u2019ve actually kind of reduced on that recently. So, then that\u2019s breakfast. And then usually, I\u2019d set off for the library so around, maybe, eleven, twelvish. And then, er, on the way to the library, I\u2019ll probably pick up a few things from  <supermarket1>  so, maybe, a meal deal and a few fruits and drinks and whatever. And then pretty much from midday till about five, maybe, I would have just had the meal deal and then I\u2019ll make my way home. And then when I get home, a cheeky little spaghetti bolognaise to start the night off. And then yeah, it just depends, really, when I sleep when I have my next meal but really and truly, it\u2019s probably another sort of snack, yeah. <new>In terms of, er, which one do I like the most or which one is most beneficial to me?<new>Oh. Before like, erm, I\u2019ve always liked breakfast, it\u2019s always been my, it\u2019s always been my favourite meal of the day, \u2018cause I, I, I learnt how to cook, erm, I learnt how to cook it quite early as well. I used to make eggs, the, the bread, the, warm up the beans, you know, I, I liked cooking breakfast. So, I would say yeah, that\u2019s the one I enjoy the most and yeah, I do think it is the most important as well, actually. Yeah, it sets up your day, you know?<new>I would say, mm, what\u2019s my favourite dish? Probably Sunday roast, I would say, yeah. And my mum makes it quite nice, actually, so. And it\u2019s not even just on Sundays we have it. In a week, typically, you\u2019d have it about twice. So, yeah, that is my favourite, with the potatoes, the sausages, chipolatas, to be specific. Chipolatas, er, gravy next to it, broccoli, carrots and, yeah, that\u2019s my favourite meal I would say."]}

So, usually, I would be working so in that case, I would probably wake up, do my normal exercise and then eat but I would eat breakfast at around ten to eleven. So, that would either be pancakes or mostly beans on toast, eggs on toast, anything with my beans, I don\u2019t usually eat normal beans, I like spicy beans, which is a bit weird. But yeah, anything like that. If there\u2019s any, if it\u2019s around lunchtime, it would probably be something frozen so like frozen pizza or like frozen burgers. In my household, we\u2019re not allowed any meat so we\u2019re completely vegetarian in this house. So, that would, so it would probably be like a margherita pizza or, you know, you have those like readymade noodles, could be those. But yeah, lunch would probably be a quick meal. Dinner is probably where we like eat the most. So, dinner for me, so I\u2019m on, I\u2019m  <continental_adj>  so it would typically be Asia-, it would be  <country1_adj>  food or sometimes, it, anything we eat would probably be vegetable orientated. So, it would either be, if it\u2019s Mexican, we\u2019ll have like loads of vegetables in a wrap, we have veg, veggie pasta. We eat dinner at around six to seven and then if any of us are hungry after, there\u2019s always like chocolate or snacks or food that we can eat after but usually, we\u2019re all full by dinner anyways. So yeah, that would be my typical meal. I don\u2019t usually snack in this house but if I\u2019m working then it\u2019s completely different. If I\u2019m working then I\u2019m going to be eating dinner. I mean, I\u2019m going to be eating lunch at work but my lunch will be dinner from the day before. And then with just a packet of crisps or like a few Oreos or a few biscuits. But yeah, that\u2019s usually my, my meal.<new>Probably the food that I eat around ten to eleven after I\u2019ve exercised because the bea-, that beans on toast or like bea-, eggs or whatever, they give you a lot of energy. And let\u2019s say like I have like a banana milkshake or something with it, it would just mean for the rest of the day that I don\u2019t snack. And that if I, the rest of the day I can go without eating until dinner. For example, today, I just had like two mozzarella and pesto sandwiches.

{"id": "07bd9c9a-3ee3-47ff-addd-b153744c642501303", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>What is religion? Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961). This definition further criticizes religion as something which individuals turn to out of worry and desperation.<nl>In addition to the functional definitions of religion which can be seen above, there is also the substantive definition of religion which can be investigated. Substantive definitions tend to define religion in terms of its content rather than its function. Here, it is common for the existence of a \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018supernatural being\u2019 to be present when defining religion. This can be seen in Roland Robertsons definition of religion, where he states that \u2018religion refers to the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life\u2019 (Robertson, 1970). Such definitions however, can be seen as problematic to the wider community. This definition of religion by Robertson, clearly necessitates the existence of a god, and rejects any ideas that do not have a \u2018god\u2019 at the centre of their ideology to be classed as religion. This would not allow for beliefs such as Buddhism to be categorised as a religion, due to the fact that it is not based upon the concept of a creator- God (Gethin, 1998). Robertson\u2019s view on religion is supported by Max Weber, who also uses a substantive concept of religion, seeing it as a belief in a divine entity which cannot be explained scientifically (Weber, 2009). In other words, the belief in a god is required for a concept to be deemed as a religion. Ronald Dworkin however, opposes this notion and states that \u2018religion, does not necessarily mean a belief in god\u2019 and \u2018religion is an interpretive concept\u2019 (Dworkin, 2013). Dworkins use of the word \u2018interpretive\u2019, infers that religion can have a different meaning, dependent on the individual. Buddhism has now been linked to the global category of a world religion (McMahan, 2012), causing much debate upon what constitutes religion. This begs the question, who has set the requirements for what can and cannot be defined as a religion? Who has the right to dictate this? As Aldridge states \u2018Defining religion involves an exercise of power\u2019 (Aldridge, 2007).<nl><nl>Religion in International Relations- Post Secularization and Foreign Policy <nl>Often, when analysing religion within the international relations scene it can be deemed an aspect which is hastily overlooked. Religion is rarely included in most major theories of international relations and this can be ascribed to major Western social thinkers rejecting the notion of religion (Fox and Sandler, 2004), as discussed previously. As a particular scholar illustrated , \u2018the role of religion in explaining attitudes toward issues of international relations is somewhat limited\u2019 (Jelen, 1994). However, when further analysing international relations and conflict, it is clear that religion can be seen as a crucial element which should not be disregarded. It has been said that \u2018Domestic conflicts, including religious conflicts are becoming increasingly international issues\u2019 (Fox and Sandler, 2004). This extract from \u2018Bringing religion into International Relations\u2019, further emphasis the vital role that religion can play when assessing international relations. Examples of conflict which involve religion are The Israel Palestine conflict and the Thirty Years war. Here, religion can be key in resolving and understanding the clash, possibly presenting a recourse. <nl>Post secularization, it has been noted that a global resurgence of religion is transforming our understanding of international relations (Thomas, 2005). As there has been an increase in religious actors, it has recently become a vital analytical focus (Haynes,2005). These religious actors can include examples such as foreign policy taking into account religion, as well as transnational factors. The more that religion begins to play a pivotal role in making country decisions, the more clarity there is on what a substantial role religion plays on the international scene. There has previously been a narrative which has pushed the notion that the term \u2018religion\u2019 carries negative connotations and only leads to tension and ferocity, bringing nothing of substance to the international relations division. This adheres to the \u2018Westphalian presumption\u2019, which holds that \u2018religious and cultural pluralism cannot be accommodated in international public life\u2019 (Thomas, 2005). In other words, faith must be conceived as an internal matter to the sovereign state in order to avoid the risk of potential religious wars. This has encouraged using scientific knowledge and clear reasoning as justification for decisions over religion. It is clear that during these strongly secular times, there wasn\u2019t a want to define the term \u2018religion\u2019 from an international perspective. However, as religion began to make a return to the international scene, events such as 911 and Samuel Huntingtons\u2019 famous \u2018The clash of civilizations?\u2019 thesis (Huntington, 2000), only drew more attention to the importance of religion on the international relations front. As there was deemed to be a rise in religious clash and issues, with pivotal events such as 911, the topic of religion had to be assessed on the international scale. <nl>Many would also agree that religion has an important role to play in creating and shaping beliefs, which may in turn influence the formulation of state policy and foreign policy considerations. An instance of this can be seen with President George W. Bush, where he referred to the US having a \u2018calling\u2019 and \u2018mission\u2019 by the \u2018Maker of heaven\u2019 in his speeches on Foreign Policy (Judis, 2005). Not only can it be inferred here that George Bush is attempting to appeal to his majority audience with his \u2018faithful\u2019 language, but his references to God here explain how religion has had a direct impact on the foreign policy choices made. Bush\u2019s choice of language and rhetoric is extremely influential in shaping perspectives of the US citizens opinions on foreign policy. It was found here that there was a clear link between religion and opinion on U.S foreign policy in the Middle East (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). In particular, Evangelical Christians are more supportive of Bush\u2019s Foreign policy on the Iraq war and his foreign policy in general (Pew Research Centre, 2020). In a specific study carried out by Pew Research Centre, even after adjusting for the identity of the respondents groups, the impact of Evangelical beliefs towards foreign policy towards the Middle East remained statistically important (Pew Research Centre, 2020). These results are significant as they provide confirmatory proof that the position of Evangelical affiliation in shaping public opinion on foreign policy is important. It is also fundamental in understanding what a large effect a single religious group can have on how a country is run. The Middle East and President George Bush are a great area of focus due to the Iraq war being a matter which has concerned wide-spread public opinion since 2003 (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). As Boyer stated \u2018For many believers in biblical prophecy, the Bush administration\u2019s go-it-alone foreign policy, hands-off attitude toward the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and proposed war on Iraq, are not simply actions in the national self-interest or an extension of the war on terrorism, but part of an unfolding divine plan\u2019 (Boyer, 2003). This quote highlights how it is recognised that many individuals feel as though these conflicts directly involve religion and god, not only country policy. This infers that individuals will use faith as a major indicator when deciding their stance on subjects such as the Iraq war and foreign policy. On the contrary, research from the Pew Research centre suggests that people feel as though their faith does not define their opinion on the Iraq War (Different Faiths, Different Messages, 2020). Either way, the fact that there is much debate around religion probes several questions on the topic of faith, making it a valid matter when discussing international relations.

There is no doubt that further research in the field of religion is vital and needed in order for a wider understanding of religion and its impact in both contexts.", "Hi ,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I cannot seem to find my result on <system>?<nl><nl>Can you please assist me with this?<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Thankyou,<nl><nl><part_FN><new>Yes I will do!<nl>Thank you <addr7_FN>,<nl><nl><part_FN><new>Hi <addr2_FN>,<nl><nl>Thank you for your quick response.

{"id": "ebf8f785-00d9-4612-bdc6-ffadc0d6d75803084", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>What is religion? Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961). This definition further criticizes religion as something which individuals turn to out of worry and desperation.<nl>In addition to the functional definitions of religion which can be seen above, there is also the substantive definition of religion which can be investigated. Substantive definitions tend to define religion in terms of its content rather than its function. Here, it is common for the existence of a \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018supernatural being\u2019 to be present when defining religion. This can be seen in Roland Robertsons definition of religion, where he states that \u2018religion refers to the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life\u2019 (Robertson, 1970). Such definitions however, can be seen as problematic to the wider community. This definition of religion by Robertson, clearly necessitates the existence of a god, and rejects any ideas that do not have a \u2018god\u2019 at the centre of their ideology to be classed as religion. This would not allow for beliefs such as Buddhism to be categorised as a religion, due to the fact that it is not based upon the concept of a creator- God (Gethin, 1998). Robertson\u2019s view on religion is supported by Max Weber, who also uses a substantive concept of religion, seeing it as a belief in a divine entity which cannot be explained scientifically (Weber, 2009). In other words, the belief in a god is required for a concept to be deemed as a religion. Ronald Dworkin however, opposes this notion and states that \u2018religion, does not necessarily mean a belief in god\u2019 and \u2018religion is an interpretive concept\u2019 (Dworkin, 2013). Dworkins use of the word \u2018interpretive\u2019, infers that religion can have a different meaning, dependent on the individual. Buddhism has now been linked to the global category of a world religion (McMahan, 2012), causing much debate upon what constitutes religion. This begs the question, who has set the requirements for what can and cannot be defined as a religion? Who has the right to dictate this? As Aldridge states \u2018Defining religion involves an exercise of power\u2019 (Aldridge, 2007).<nl><nl>Religion in International Relations- Post Secularization and Foreign Policy <nl>Often, when analysing religion within the international relations scene it can be deemed an aspect which is hastily overlooked. Religion is rarely included in most major theories of international relations and this can be ascribed to major Western social thinkers rejecting the notion of religion (Fox and Sandler, 2004), as discussed previously. As a particular scholar illustrated , \u2018the role of religion in explaining attitudes toward issues of international relations is somewhat limited\u2019 (Jelen, 1994). However, when further analysing international relations and conflict, it is clear that religion can be seen as a crucial element which should not be disregarded. It has been said that \u2018Domestic conflicts, including religious conflicts are becoming increasingly international issues\u2019 (Fox and Sandler, 2004). This extract from \u2018Bringing religion into International Relations\u2019, further emphasis the vital role that religion can play when assessing international relations. Examples of conflict which involve religion are The Israel Palestine conflict and the Thirty Years war. Here, religion can be key in resolving and understanding the clash, possibly presenting a recourse. <nl>Post secularization, it has been noted that a global resurgence of religion is transforming our understanding of international relations (Thomas, 2005). As there has been an increase in religious actors, it has recently become a vital analytical focus (Haynes,2005). These religious actors can include examples such as foreign policy taking into account religion, as well as transnational factors. The more that religion begins to play a pivotal role in making country decisions, the more clarity there is on what a substantial role religion plays on the international scene. There has previously been a narrative which has pushed the notion that the term \u2018religion\u2019 carries negative connotations and only leads to tension and ferocity, bringing nothing of substance to the international relations division. This adheres to the \u2018Westphalian presumption\u2019, which holds that \u2018religious and cultural pluralism cannot be accommodated in international public life\u2019 (Thomas, 2005). In other words, faith must be conceived as an internal matter to the sovereign state in order to avoid the risk of potential religious wars. This has encouraged using scientific knowledge and clear reasoning as justification for decisions over religion. It is clear that during these strongly secular times, there wasn\u2019t a want to define the term \u2018religion\u2019 from an international perspective. However, as religion began to make a return to the international scene, events such as 911 and Samuel Huntingtons\u2019 famous \u2018The clash of civilizations?\u2019 thesis (Huntington, 2000), only drew more attention to the importance of religion on the international relations front. As there was deemed to be a rise in religious clash and issues, with pivotal events such as 911, the topic of religion had to be assessed on the international scale. <nl>Many would also agree that religion has an important role to play in creating and shaping beliefs, which may in turn influence the formulation of state policy and foreign policy considerations. An instance of this can be seen with President George W. Bush, where he referred to the US having a \u2018calling\u2019 and \u2018mission\u2019 by the \u2018Maker of heaven\u2019 in his speeches on Foreign Policy (Judis, 2005). Not only can it be inferred here that George Bush is attempting to appeal to his majority audience with his \u2018faithful\u2019 language, but his references to God here explain how religion has had a direct impact on the foreign policy choices made. Bush\u2019s choice of language and rhetoric is extremely influential in shaping perspectives of the US citizens opinions on foreign policy. It was found here that there was a clear link between religion and opinion on U.S foreign policy in the Middle East (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). In particular, Evangelical Christians are more supportive of Bush\u2019s Foreign policy on the Iraq war and his foreign policy in general (Pew Research Centre, 2020). In a specific study carried out by Pew Research Centre, even after adjusting for the identity of the respondents groups, the impact of Evangelical beliefs towards foreign policy towards the Middle East remained statistically important (Pew Research Centre, 2020). These results are significant as they provide confirmatory proof that the position of Evangelical affiliation in shaping public opinion on foreign policy is important. It is also fundamental in understanding what a large effect a single religious group can have on how a country is run. The Middle East and President George Bush are a great area of focus due to the Iraq war being a matter which has concerned wide-spread public opinion since 2003 (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). As Boyer stated \u2018For many believers in biblical prophecy, the Bush administration\u2019s go-it-alone foreign policy, hands-off attitude toward the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and proposed war on Iraq, are not simply actions in the national self-interest or an extension of the war on terrorism, but part of an unfolding divine plan\u2019 (Boyer, 2003). This quote highlights how it is recognised that many individuals feel as though these conflicts directly involve religion and god, not only country policy. This infers that individuals will use faith as a major indicator when deciding their stance on subjects such as the Iraq war and foreign policy. On the contrary, research from the Pew Research centre suggests that people feel as though their faith does not define their opinion on the Iraq War (Different Faiths, Different Messages, 2020). Either way, the fact that there is much debate around religion probes several questions on the topic of faith, making it a valid matter when discussing international relations. As religion is increasingly being used for justification as well as indication, it is an important matter to consider on the international scene. \u00a8<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, when looking at definitions of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the context of both Sociology and International relations, it is obvious that there is much debate around what the word entails and its specific effects on society, good or bad.

{"id": "16b26fe3-5ae1-4b00-90ca-52678973d2b7", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl><nl>With the average person in the UK spending 110 minutes on social media, it is inevitable that content displayed across these platforms impact and influence societal norms. The nature of social media aids the ability for societal norms to not only be fueled and accepted across various cultures but also enable this to occur at an accelerated pace. However, the media has been proven to impact self-evaluation in a negative way. For example, there are numerous studies looking at women\u2019s self-evaluation, comparing weight-esteem based on neutral images or ideal images (Brown, Novick, Lord, &amp; Richards, 1992); self-worth based on social comparison (Jones &amp; Buckingham, 2005) etc. Unfortunately, looking at the effects on self-worth in men is minimal. This may be due to the rhetoric that portrays men as emotionless and when any type of emotion is displayed, idioms and phrases like \u2018be a man\u2019 or \u2018stop being a baby\u2019 comes into play. Due to this societal norm, it may make it difficult for men to be able to find appropriate support online and on social media platforms when struggling with the negative impact these sites can have on self worth. It is more acceptable for women to seek help online however, there is less support for men. By researching further into the impacts social media has on men\u2019s self worth, it can enable men to feel more comfortable when facing these issues. The research can aid understanding of this and also result in this topic becoming less taboo, giving a better chance for men to talk freely about their experiences.<nl><nl>I have investigated men\u2019s self worth in the context of social media and my main research question is \u2018How do young men talk about self worth within the context of social media (18-25)?\u2019. My method of analysis is discourse analysis as it allows for in-depth analysis into not only my participant\u2019s language use to construct ideas but also intonation. The interview will take place over a \u2018Zoom\u2019 video call, therefore I am able to have a video recording of all my participants' answers. <nl><nl>AnalysisResults<nl><nl>Through annotating my transcript I was able to select prominent themes that were discussed by my participant in the interview. These themes are spoken of throughout the interview and appear multiple times, even in different questions. From my initial question (line 7) I was able to determine that my participant is an avid user of social media, using it for entertainment purposes as well as using various platforms. This ensures that the questions I ask are relevant to my participant and the answers reflect their social media usage. <nl><nl>Key themes that were discussed by my participant include \"the ideal man\", involving image, appearance and social status; also \"alternate reality\", discussing not only the falseness of social media but also the construction of one's image on social media platforms.<nl><nl>The Ideal Man<nl><nl>The idea of \u2018the ideal man\u2019 featured within my participants answers multiple times, with a construction of what they personally believe to be the ideal man. As opposed to referring to what my participant feels they should look like, my participant instead suggests what others \"should be looking for\" (line 174) in a man, for example, the ideal height \"6 foot 4, or over 6 foot\" (line 175),  the ideal body, having \"six packs\" (line 138), adequate facial hair \"beard\" (line 176) etc. This is a very specific portrayal of men, suggesting that this is a common image for men to hold and strive to achieve. Although men do have an idea of what the ideal body type is they are also aware that in general life, this may not always be the case, with my participant stating that \"It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of me. It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of anyone I know.\" (line 162-163) when asked if he felt represented by men on social media. However, despite this acknowledgement, my participant still felt uncomfortable for comparisons between the appearance of men on social media and himself. My participant used the phrase \"I\u2019d prefer just to leave it at that\" (lines 161 and 294) indicating that men do feel uncomfortable about discussing their appearance, which supports the taboo of men expressing self-doubt and lacking self worth and lowered confidence. This would explain why my participant referred to other people he knows whenever talking about personal appearance, in order to make his answer generalised as opposed to solely him as well as deflect the discomfort about the fact that he is not the ideal man by justifying it with the fact that most people do not look like that. This is supported when he says \"I don\u2019t think many men would want to admit, especially among their peers, wouldn\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re not the ideal person.\" (lines 354-355) <nl><nl>In addition to the body image, a man\u2019s social status and financial status also seems to be prevalent when it comes to describing the \u2018ideal man\u2019 with my participant referring to men with \"seven figures\" (line 138), and men who have \"lavish\" (line 81 ) lifestyles. A given example was the actor and influencer \u2018Dan Bilzerian\u2019; well known for \"constantly flaunting a bunch of money\" (line 241) and \"constantly surrounded by money\". (line 242) This was someone who my participant would refer to as a \u2018role model\u2019 for most males. My participant also referred to the fact that \"men can be successful on social media without looking the greatest\" (line 225), due to their social and financial status. This is supported by the evolutionary psychology theory that women will desire men who are able to provide stability, in the forms of shelter, money, food etc. (Li, Li, Chan &amp; Zhang, 2016). This would explain that now in the digital age, men are able to attract attention with their wealth via social media through posting \"lavish\" (line 81) objects. As it is now commonplace for influencers to be posting this type of content, as my participant stated, \"ordinary people might look at that and think \u2018Well, that\u2019s not me\u2019.\"(line  So this becomes the new goals and the new norm. It is evident that the fact that my participant did not relate to these standards, as when asked if he felt represented by these role models and depictions of men he stated \"No. No. No. No I don\u2019t.\" (line 156) Being unable to relate to the norm often results in incongruence between one's actual self and ideal self which may lower self worth. (Rogers, 1959).<nl><nl>My participant states that they have changed themselves in order to conform with these standards, however wished not to elaborate on how he changed. Instead he referred to people that he knew of, talking about there being  \"a lot of men that will spend a bunch of time at the gym to try and achieve the body that every man wants.\" (lines 347-348) This emphasises that the pressures displayed online and on social media affects men enough for them to wish to change their lifestyle in order to relate to these standards. <nl><nl>Alternate Reality<nl><nl>Throughout my participants answers he refers to the fact that social media is \"not a true depiction\" (line 60) , is a \"very, very fake place\" (lines 104, 71, 63), \"is quite a negative place\" (lines 70, 84) , is \"not real\" (line 107) , is \"very unhealthy\" (line 117), has \"bad sides\" (line 123), is \"the furthest thing from real life\" (lines 147-148) etc. This is common in all the answers, and is said in multiple different ways. My participant referred to social media in very negative ways, and suggested it is a \"toxic\" (line 136) place, despite spending around \"5 hours\" (line 15) per day. This is not an uncommon amount of time on social media, however spending this much time surrounded by something that is perceived as negative by my participant, it is unsurprising that his self confidence is impacted. Also, despite this awareness of the fact that not everything is quite what it seems on social media, the standards are still internalised. This suggests that regardless of the reality or the accuracy of the things that one may be exposed to, they are still accepted by people and becomes the societal norm. My participant also refers to the fact that women are more educated about the ways images are distorted online as opposed to enhancements and photoshop for men.  <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl><nl>From my research, it is evident that despite being aware of the falseness and unrealistic standards of social media, it is evident that young men\u2019s self worth is impacted negatively by the content they are exposed to on social media. Despite being adamant that they are aware of the one sidedness of social media, men continue to make comparisons and draw from this to bring into real life situations.

{"id": "339d8533-fc5e-4e45-860f-ded0afc56d39", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>What is religion? Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961). This definition further criticizes religion as something which individuals turn to out of worry and desperation.<nl>In addition to the functional definitions of religion which can be seen above, there is also the substantive definition of religion which can be investigated. Substantive definitions tend to define religion in terms of its content rather than its function. Here, it is common for the existence of a \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018supernatural being\u2019 to be present when defining religion. This can be seen in Roland Robertsons definition of religion, where he states that \u2018religion refers to the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life\u2019 (Robertson, 1970). Such definitions however, can be seen as problematic to the wider community. This definition of religion by Robertson, clearly necessitates the existence of a god, and rejects any ideas that do not have a \u2018god\u2019 at the centre of their ideology to be classed as religion. This would not allow for beliefs such as Buddhism to be categorised as a religion, due to the fact that it is not based upon the concept of a creator- God (Gethin, 1998). Robertson\u2019s view on religion is supported by Max Weber, who also uses a substantive concept of religion, seeing it as a belief in a divine entity which cannot be explained scientifically (Weber, 2009). In other words, the belief in a god is required for a concept to be deemed as a religion. Ronald Dworkin however, opposes this notion and states that \u2018religion, does not necessarily mean a belief in god\u2019 and \u2018religion is an interpretive concept\u2019 (Dworkin, 2013). Dworkins use of the word \u2018interpretive\u2019, infers that religion can have a different meaning, dependent on the individual. Buddhism has now been linked to the global category of a world religion (McMahan, 2012), causing much debate upon what constitutes religion. This begs the question, who has set the requirements for what can and cannot be defined as a religion? Who has the right to dictate this? As Aldridge states \u2018Defining religion involves an exercise of power\u2019 (Aldridge, 2007).<nl><nl>Religion in International Relations- Post Secularization and Foreign Policy <nl>Often, when analysing religion within the international relations scene it can be deemed an aspect which is hastily overlooked. Religion is rarely included in most major theories of international relations and this can be ascribed to major Western social thinkers rejecting the notion of religion (Fox and Sandler, 2004), as discussed previously. As a particular scholar illustrated , \u2018the role of religion in explaining attitudes toward issues of international relations is somewhat limited\u2019 (Jelen, 1994). However, when further analysing international relations and conflict, it is clear that religion can be seen as a crucial element which should not be disregarded. It has been said that \u2018Domestic conflicts, including religious conflicts are becoming increasingly international issues\u2019 (Fox and Sandler, 2004). This extract from \u2018Bringing religion into International Relations\u2019, further emphasis the vital role that religion can play when assessing international relations. Examples of conflict which involve religion are The Israel Palestine conflict and the Thirty Years war. Here, religion can be key in resolving and understanding the clash, possibly presenting a recourse. <nl>Post secularization, it has been noted that a global resurgence of religion is transforming our understanding of international relations (Thomas, 2005). As there has been an increase in religious actors, it has recently become a vital analytical focus (Haynes,2005). These religious actors can include examples such as foreign policy taking into account religion, as well as transnational factors. The more that religion begins to play a pivotal role in making country decisions, the more clarity there is on what a substantial role religion plays on the international scene. There has previously been a narrative which has pushed the notion that the term \u2018religion\u2019 carries negative connotations and only leads to tension and ferocity, bringing nothing of substance to the international relations division. This adheres to the \u2018Westphalian presumption\u2019, which holds that \u2018religious and cultural pluralism cannot be accommodated in international public life\u2019 (Thomas, 2005). In other words, faith must be conceived as an internal matter to the sovereign state in order to avoid the risk of potential religious wars. This has encouraged using scientific knowledge and clear reasoning as justification for decisions over religion. It is clear that during these strongly secular times, there wasn\u2019t a want to define the term \u2018religion\u2019 from an international perspective. However, as religion began to make a return to the international scene, events such as 911 and Samuel Huntingtons\u2019 famous \u2018The clash of civilizations?\u2019 thesis (Huntington, 2000), only drew more attention to the importance of religion on the international relations front. As there was deemed to be a rise in religious clash and issues, with pivotal events such as 911, the topic of religion had to be assessed on the international scale. <nl>Many would also agree that religion has an important role to play in creating and shaping beliefs, which may in turn influence the formulation of state policy and foreign policy considerations. An instance of this can be seen with President George W. Bush, where he referred to the US having a \u2018calling\u2019 and \u2018mission\u2019 by the \u2018Maker of heaven\u2019 in his speeches on Foreign Policy (Judis, 2005). Not only can it be inferred here that George Bush is attempting to appeal to his majority audience with his \u2018faithful\u2019 language, but his references to God here explain how religion has had a direct impact on the foreign policy choices made. Bush\u2019s choice of language and rhetoric is extremely influential in shaping perspectives of the US citizens opinions on foreign policy. It was found here that there was a clear link between religion and opinion on U.S foreign policy in the Middle East (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). In particular, Evangelical Christians are more supportive of Bush\u2019s Foreign policy on the Iraq war and his foreign policy in general (Pew Research Centre, 2020). In a specific study carried out by Pew Research Centre, even after adjusting for the identity of the respondents groups, the impact of Evangelical beliefs towards foreign policy towards the Middle East remained statistically important (Pew Research Centre, 2020). These results are significant as they provide confirmatory proof that the position of Evangelical affiliation in shaping public opinion on foreign policy is important. It is also fundamental in understanding what a large effect a single religious group can have on how a country is run. The Middle East and President George Bush are a great area of focus due to the Iraq war being a matter which has concerned wide-spread public opinion since 2003 (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). As Boyer stated \u2018For many believers in biblical prophecy, the Bush administration\u2019s go-it-alone foreign policy, hands-off attitude toward the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and proposed war on Iraq, are not simply actions in the national self-interest or an extension of the war on terrorism, but part of an unfolding divine plan\u2019 (Boyer, 2003). This quote highlights how it is recognised that many individuals feel as though these conflicts directly involve religion and god, not only country policy. This infers that individuals will use faith as a major indicator when deciding their stance on subjects such as the Iraq war and foreign policy. On the contrary, research from the Pew Research centre suggests that people feel as though their faith does not define their opinion on the Iraq War (Different Faiths, Different Messages, 2020). Either way, the fact that there is much debate around religion probes several questions on the topic of faith, making it a valid matter when discussing international relations. As religion is increasingly being used for justification as well as indication, it is an important matter to consider on the international scene. \u00a8<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, when looking at definitions of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the context of both Sociology and International relations, it is obvious that there is much debate around what the word entails and its specific effects on society, good or bad. It is clear however, that religion has played a large role in shaping and moulding the current societies that we live in today, as well as the international relations scene, be it secular or not. Although there may be much debate upon whether the consequences of religion are \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 and \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019, the simple fact that decisions have and are being made based upon this, make it a crucial element that must be taken into consideration when looking at both society and international relations. There is no doubt that further research in the field of religion is vital and needed in order for a wider understanding of religion and its impact in both contexts.", "We\u2019ve got a as WhatsApp group for the <module> essay.

I'm writing this email on behalf of us all in regards to the maintenance of the house.<nl><nl>Firstly, the fridge has been a recurring problem. This is because from day one it has always been difficult to fully close it - partly due to the design of the cupboard door and the fact that the freezer isn\u2019t working properly and as a result the ice builds up and doesn\u2019t allow it to close. This further prevents the fridge from closing properly in addition to the cupboard design door. This ongoing issue has resulted in numerous amounts of food not being kept properly and the unfortunate throwing away of them. We are all experiencing hard times as we attempt to continue living with COVID19, therefore the continuous cycle of buying food and it going off due to a dysfucntional and ineffective fridge makes these times just that much harder.<nl><nl>A contractor was sent out once and the service he provided was not good enough as this is still a very important issue - if not the most important as it directly effects our health and safety.<nl><nl>Another issue in the kitchen is that one of the lower cabinet doors has come off. I believe the inside components have snapped and the repair will require new parts.<nl><nl>The last of the issues in the kitchen is the metal wall section behind the sink. The bottom part of it has opened and essentially began to peel off. This also needs to be fixed because if its allowed to continue peeling the wall behind it will start to get wet from the sink and cause further damage to the property.<nl><nl>In line with maintenance requests, it has also been brought to my attention that the top floor tenant is extremely unhappy with the mattress she is having to use as she says all she can feel is the springs within it. This causes severe joint and shoulder pain - again this is important as it has a direct impact on her health. If this could be replaced it would be most helpful, as we are timely paying tenants who don\u2019t believe this to be an unjust request.<nl><nl>I did contact the <business> property management mobile contact number ending 152, I was directed to report all maintenance issues through property file.

{"id": "75f45309-fb3e-4fc9-82d1-d4e3e803ad6f05836", "discourse_types": ["essay", "speech_transcription"], "pair": ["New liberalism was born after a new wave of liberals in the late 19th century to the early 20th century challenged the positions of classical liberals such as Adam Smith and John Locke. Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state.", "So in the image one there\u2019s er, two people.

{"id": "986ba847-3e3a-4c16-83ac-fc5642bc6aab", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>What is religion? Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961). This definition further criticizes religion as something which individuals turn to out of worry and desperation.<nl>In addition to the functional definitions of religion which can be seen above, there is also the substantive definition of religion which can be investigated. Substantive definitions tend to define religion in terms of its content rather than its function. Here, it is common for the existence of a \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018supernatural being\u2019 to be present when defining religion. This can be seen in Roland Robertsons definition of religion, where he states that \u2018religion refers to the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life\u2019 (Robertson, 1970). Such definitions however, can be seen as problematic to the wider community. This definition of religion by Robertson, clearly necessitates the existence of a god, and rejects any ideas that do not have a \u2018god\u2019 at the centre of their ideology to be classed as religion. This would not allow for beliefs such as Buddhism to be categorised as a religion, due to the fact that it is not based upon the concept of a creator- God (Gethin, 1998). Robertson\u2019s view on religion is supported by Max Weber, who also uses a substantive concept of religion, seeing it as a belief in a divine entity which cannot be explained scientifically (Weber, 2009). In other words, the belief in a god is required for a concept to be deemed as a religion. Ronald Dworkin however, opposes this notion and states that \u2018religion, does not necessarily mean a belief in god\u2019 and \u2018religion is an interpretive concept\u2019 (Dworkin, 2013). Dworkins use of the word \u2018interpretive\u2019, infers that religion can have a different meaning, dependent on the individual. Buddhism has now been linked to the global category of a world religion (McMahan, 2012), causing much debate upon what constitutes religion. This begs the question, who has set the requirements for what can and cannot be defined as a religion? Who has the right to dictate this? As Aldridge states \u2018Defining religion involves an exercise of power\u2019 (Aldridge, 2007).<nl><nl>Religion in International Relations- Post Secularization and Foreign Policy <nl>Often, when analysing religion within the international relations scene it can be deemed an aspect which is hastily overlooked. Religion is rarely included in most major theories of international relations and this can be ascribed to major Western social thinkers rejecting the notion of religion (Fox and Sandler, 2004), as discussed previously. As a particular scholar illustrated , \u2018the role of religion in explaining attitudes toward issues of international relations is somewhat limited\u2019 (Jelen, 1994). However, when further analysing international relations and conflict, it is clear that religion can be seen as a crucial element which should not be disregarded. It has been said that \u2018Domestic conflicts, including religious conflicts are becoming increasingly international issues\u2019 (Fox and Sandler, 2004). This extract from \u2018Bringing religion into International Relations\u2019, further emphasis the vital role that religion can play when assessing international relations. Examples of conflict which involve religion are The Israel Palestine conflict and the Thirty Years war. Here, religion can be key in resolving and understanding the clash, possibly presenting a recourse. <nl>Post secularization, it has been noted that a global resurgence of religion is transforming our understanding of international relations (Thomas, 2005). As there has been an increase in religious actors, it has recently become a vital analytical focus (Haynes,2005). These religious actors can include examples such as foreign policy taking into account religion, as well as transnational factors. The more that religion begins to play a pivotal role in making country decisions, the more clarity there is on what a substantial role religion plays on the international scene. There has previously been a narrative which has pushed the notion that the term \u2018religion\u2019 carries negative connotations and only leads to tension and ferocity, bringing nothing of substance to the international relations division. This adheres to the \u2018Westphalian presumption\u2019, which holds that \u2018religious and cultural pluralism cannot be accommodated in international public life\u2019 (Thomas, 2005). In other words, faith must be conceived as an internal matter to the sovereign state in order to avoid the risk of potential religious wars. This has encouraged using scientific knowledge and clear reasoning as justification for decisions over religion. It is clear that during these strongly secular times, there wasn\u2019t a want to define the term \u2018religion\u2019 from an international perspective. However, as religion began to make a return to the international scene, events such as 911 and Samuel Huntingtons\u2019 famous \u2018The clash of civilizations?\u2019 thesis (Huntington, 2000), only drew more attention to the importance of religion on the international relations front. As there was deemed to be a rise in religious clash and issues, with pivotal events such as 911, the topic of religion had to be assessed on the international scale. <nl>Many would also agree that religion has an important role to play in creating and shaping beliefs, which may in turn influence the formulation of state policy and foreign policy considerations. An instance of this can be seen with President George W. Bush, where he referred to the US having a \u2018calling\u2019 and \u2018mission\u2019 by the \u2018Maker of heaven\u2019 in his speeches on Foreign Policy (Judis, 2005). Not only can it be inferred here that George Bush is attempting to appeal to his majority audience with his \u2018faithful\u2019 language, but his references to God here explain how religion has had a direct impact on the foreign policy choices made. Bush\u2019s choice of language and rhetoric is extremely influential in shaping perspectives of the US citizens opinions on foreign policy. It was found here that there was a clear link between religion and opinion on U.S foreign policy in the Middle East (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). In particular, Evangelical Christians are more supportive of Bush\u2019s Foreign policy on the Iraq war and his foreign policy in general (Pew Research Centre, 2020). In a specific study carried out by Pew Research Centre, even after adjusting for the identity of the respondents groups, the impact of Evangelical beliefs towards foreign policy towards the Middle East remained statistically important (Pew Research Centre, 2020). These results are significant as they provide confirmatory proof that the position of Evangelical affiliation in shaping public opinion on foreign policy is important. It is also fundamental in understanding what a large effect a single religious group can have on how a country is run. The Middle East and President George Bush are a great area of focus due to the Iraq war being a matter which has concerned wide-spread public opinion since 2003 (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). As Boyer stated \u2018For many believers in biblical prophecy, the Bush administration\u2019s go-it-alone foreign policy, hands-off attitude toward the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and proposed war on Iraq, are not simply actions in the national self-interest or an extension of the war on terrorism, but part of an unfolding divine plan\u2019 (Boyer, 2003). This quote highlights how it is recognised that many individuals feel as though these conflicts directly involve religion and god, not only country policy. This infers that individuals will use faith as a major indicator when deciding their stance on subjects such as the Iraq war and foreign policy. On the contrary, research from the Pew Research centre suggests that people feel as though their faith does not define their opinion on the Iraq War (Different Faiths, Different Messages, 2020). Either way, the fact that there is much debate around religion probes several questions on the topic of faith, making it a valid matter when discussing international relations. As religion is increasingly being used for justification as well as indication, it is an important matter to consider on the international scene. \u00a8<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, when looking at definitions of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the context of both Sociology and International relations, it is obvious that there is much debate around what the word entails and its specific effects on society, good or bad. It is clear however, that religion has played a large role in shaping and moulding the current societies that we live in today, as well as the international relations scene, be it secular or not. Although there may be much debate upon whether the consequences of religion are \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 and \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019, the simple fact that decisions have and are being made based upon this, make it a crucial element that must be taken into consideration when looking at both society and international relations. There is no doubt that further research in the field of religion is vital and needed in order for a wider understanding of religion and its impact in both contexts.", "Erm, mm.  <misc> , what is a food I\u2019ve never tried.

The results showed that there was a significantly higher in left than right cue condition, and supported the hypothesis.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha activity refers to electrical impulses oscillating at 8-13Hz , this is an alpha wave. These brain waves begin in the cerebral cortex (Moini &amp; Piran, 2020) and occur during periods of inattention, where one is in a restful state, whilst being awake, examples of this is when closing eyes, meditating (Lagopoulos et al., 2009), daydreaming etc.  When the brain begins to focus on stimuli, alpha waves are suppressed. The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007), proposes that high alpha indicates disengagement and inhibition of task irrelevant brain areas. In task relevant brain areas, alpha remains low, supporting that alpha activity is modulated by attention.  <nl><nl>This hypothesis is supported by Magosso et al, 2019, which used a regular setting and a VR (virtual reality) setting to see if the intensity of the task and the levels of attention required affects alpha frequency. The results showed that alpha signals are suppressed when having to give attention to tasks although it seems that when isolated from all external features (when participating in VR) alpha activity becomes greater. This suggests that it is the modulation and diversion of attention which causes changes in alpha frequencies.<nl><nl>Sauseng et al (2005) presented participants with directional cues indicating which hemifield the target stimuli would appear in. The target stimuli consisted of either small or large bars which participants identified and responded with \u2018s\u2019 for small and \u2018l\u2019 for large. Results showed that there was stronger alpha frequency suppression in brain areas contralateral to the targeted hemifield. This is due to visual stimuli being processed contralaterally. 200ms before the stimuli was presented, in active processing areas like the parietal lobe (P3), the alpha range is also lower. This study is supportive of AIM (Klimesch et al, 2007), and is used as the basis for this experiment, as it is a partial replication. In this experiment, the focus will be on the effect of arrow cues, specifically the direction they are facing.<nl><nl>Hypothesis<nl>As AIH states, alpha range activity is present in areas that are uninvolved in active processing and is suppressed in areas that actively process. By directing attention, and cueing the participant to expect the stimuli in a specific region they will begin paying attention. As shown by Sauseng et al (2005), visual stimuli is processed contralaterally resulting in alpha suppression in the other side of the brain. For example, if the stimuli is present in the left visual field it will be processed by the right hemisphere. By using the left parietal cortex (P3) to record alpha activity, it is expected that alpha activity will be greater when a stimulus is shown on the left and for this activity to be suppressed when the stimuli is on the right.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 undergraduate students were participants chosen from an opportunity sample.<nl><nl>Design<nl>This experiment uses a within subjects design. The dependent variable is the alpha range amplitudes (microvolts) on the left hand side of the parietal lobe (P3). The independent variable is the direction of the arrow cue, with two levels, left or right. <nl>Materials<nl>This experiment used a Biopac MP36 to collect data, EEG electrodes, AC Cream, Abrasive paste, PsychoPy to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device and stimuli (see figure 1). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG by opening the Biopac student lab. From the \u2018analog\u2019 tab select Electroencaphagram (EEG)\u2019 \u20180.5-100Hz wnotch\u2019, so the 50Hz band is filtered out. Digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker.. The \u2018calculation\u2019 tab allowed alpha frequency to be recorded. Then select \u2018EEG alpha 8-13Hz\u2019 from the drop down list. The sampling rate was 1000Hz. The participant was then prepared to be attached to the EEG. The electrode sites were abraded with everi cream using a cotton bud, and then AC cream was put on the electrodes. The electrodes are placed using the 1020 system. The active electrode was placed on P3. Participants were then given a cued visual task. A fixation cross was cued at the centre of the screen for 34ms, followed by an arrow indicating where to focus attention, with a 50% chance of it being cued left or right. There was then an interval of 600-800ms followed by a fixation cross for the second time, finally the participant was shown the target stimuli for 50ms, either a large or small white bar against a black background. Participants were then asked to use the keyboard to respond to the stimuli, typing either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. 75% of the trials were valid (the target stimuli was presented in the same hemifield that the arrow cue indicated), and 25% were invalid (the target stimuli was presented in the other hemifield). There were 20 blocks of the four trial types (cue left with a small bar, cue right with a small bar, cue left with a large bar and cue right with a large bar) so in total there were 80 trials.<nl><nl>Results<nl>There were transformations applied to the raw 9-13Hz alpha EEG data. There were eventmarkers received by PsychoPy through the Stimtracker, in order to identify when the stimuli was presented to the participants. The data also was used to specifically analyse from 200ms prior to stimulus onset after the directional arrow cues had been shown. Furthermore, the data was rectified, making negative values positive despite them showing excitatory or inhibitory activity. The samples were also averaged in order to limit the impact that outlying values would have on the data. This data is referred to as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl><nl>Descriptive Statistics<nl><table><nl><nl>Inferential Statistics <nl>The wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T=566, n=38, p=.002).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results of this experiment show that there was a significantly higher level of alpha activity when the stimulus was shown on the left hand side, this fit the original hypothesis. These results are consistent with AIH (Klimesch et al, 2007) as it shows that when participants are given a stimulus in their left hemifield, due to contralateral processing, this is processed by the right part of brain areas. As we were looking at P3, the left side of the parietal lobe, when shown a cue on the left it was processed on the right, meaning the left was task irrelevant and inattentive, resulting in higher alpha activity.<nl><nl>Methodological Problems<nl>Factors which may have confounded data include artefacts, which is when the EEG is contaminated by excess movement. When eye movements take place, the electrical activity could be recorded as brain activity. Eye movements could be blinking or horizontal eye movement, especially when having to look at either side of the screen. Blinking could also pose other issues such as the participant missing the cue. However, it does not seem to be too much of an issue and repetition and more trials would minimise the effects of this.<nl>Another issue could be the laboratory setting, as this could have an affect on brain activity. This is not a very normal situation for participants to be placed in so they may be uncomfortable or more alert as they know they are being studied. This could impact the EEG recordings as it is not a life-like situation so the results may not be generalisable to the whole population.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Overall, the data is valid despite minor methodological issues, which after replication can minimise the effect of individual differences, such as blinking and horizontal eye movement. The data also supports AIH and produced the expected results.", "Dear <addr16_FN>,<nl>I have been looking for the <location> and am unable to find it, I have asked the main reception as well as the other <organisation> reception.

I'm writing this email on behalf of us all in regards to the maintenance of the house.<nl><nl>Firstly, the fridge has been a recurring problem. This is because from day one it has always been difficult to fully close it - partly due to the design of the cupboard door and the fact that the freezer isn\u2019t working properly and as a result the ice builds up and doesn\u2019t allow it to close. This further prevents the fridge from closing properly in addition to the cupboard design door. This ongoing issue has resulted in numerous amounts of food not being kept properly and the unfortunate throwing away of them. We are all experiencing hard times as we attempt to continue living with COVID19, therefore the continuous cycle of buying food and it going off due to a dysfucntional and ineffective fridge makes these times just that much harder.<nl><nl>A contractor was sent out once and the service he provided was not good enough as this is still a very important issue - if not the most important as it directly effects our health and safety.<nl><nl>Another issue in the kitchen is that one of the lower cabinet doors has come off. I believe the inside components have snapped and the repair will require new parts.<nl><nl>The last of the issues in the kitchen is the metal wall section behind the sink. The bottom part of it has opened and essentially began to peel off. This also needs to be fixed because if its allowed to continue peeling the wall behind it will start to get wet from the sink and cause further damage to the property.<nl><nl>In line with maintenance requests, it has also been brought to my attention that the top floor tenant is extremely unhappy with the mattress she is having to use as she says all she can feel is the springs within it. This causes severe joint and shoulder pain - again this is important as it has a direct impact on her health. If this could be replaced it would be most helpful, as we are timely paying tenants who don\u2019t believe this to be an unjust request.<nl><nl>I did contact the <business> property management mobile contact number ending 152, I was directed to report all maintenance issues through property file. However, we were not given access to this platform and so can\u2019t use it.

Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}

This is because from day one it has always been difficult to fully close it - partly due to the design of the cupboard door and the fact that the freezer isn\u2019t working properly and as a result the ice builds up and doesn\u2019t allow it to close. This further prevents the fridge from closing properly in addition to the cupboard design door. This ongoing issue has resulted in numerous amounts of food not being kept properly and the unfortunate throwing away of them. We are all experiencing hard times as we attempt to continue living with COVID19, therefore the continuous cycle of buying food and it going off due to a dysfucntional and ineffective fridge makes these times just that much harder.<nl><nl>A contractor was sent out once and the service he provided was not good enough as this is still a very important issue - if not the most important as it directly effects our health and safety.<nl><nl>Another issue in the kitchen is that one of the lower cabinet doors has come off.

Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession.

Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}

{"id": "3fd608df-ebd6-45d2-8391-e22330fab6cf05239", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["The Modern State is seen to have five key features: sovereignty, public institutions, territorial association, legitimation and domination (D\u2019Amato, 2018). These characteristics can be highlighted as territory (an area with defined borders), external and internal sovereignty where a state must be able to defend its territory and not be too dependent on another power. A state achieves sovereignty when it is recognised by the family of states as the \u2018sole governing authority within its territory and as the legal equal of other states\u2019 (The Modern State, 2020). Furthermore, there has to be legitimacy in which there is recognised rule, examples of this are traditional legitimacy, charismatic legitimacy and rational-legal legitimacy; the legitimacy enhances a state\u2019s sovereignty at a lower cost. The last characteristic is modern bureaucracy, this is required to generate as well as collect revenue. In this essay we will be discussing and critically examining Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, who criticizes the moralistic view of authority. Machiavelli although seen as an evil man, had a large influence on the future of modern civilisation especially in comparison to the artists of his time. <nl><nl>For Machiavelli, moral basis on which to judge the difference between illegitimate and legitimate uses of power does not exist, arguing that this does not add to the actual possession of power \u2013 rather the legitimacy rests upon the threat of coercive force. His beliefs rest in those that the leaders should avoid the common values of justice and mercy in preference to the use of violence and fear, particularly if it is in the best interest such as through gaining and expanding political power. Historians have stated Machiavelli to be the \u2018teacher of evil\u2019 such as Leo Strauss (McShea, 1963). However, Machiavelli has been credited with formulating the \"modern concept of the state\", that is understood in the Weberian sense of a \u2018form of rule possessing a monopoly of coercive authority within a set territorial boundary\u2019 (Nederman, 2019). Machiavelli derived his views from the experience of the Caesura Borgia.  However, Machiavelli did contribute to the way we understand the modern state now as he proposed his own conception of the \"civil principality\" whilst subverting his previous medieval idea of state as regime (Sellers,2015). However, it should be noted that force is not the only weapon to rule the people so his argument can be seen as psychologically weak.<nl><nl>Machiavelli also states that principality can be seen to be governed by a single ruler and is helped by anointed ministers which is the case in many current states seen today. Machiavelli states that the idea of taking over depends on the character of region than the character of the prince, he has the strong belief that the citizens will recollect and fight for their liberty. Although we have grown out of medieval brutality, it can be argued that the modern-day equivalent of killing is to send rivals to jail or allow opponents to lose if there is indecisiveness. An example of this is Brexit, where the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was seen as indecisive and therefore could not gain enough votes in time for the referendum. Another way Machiavelli is modernised is through the idea that leaders will need to make severe decisions, such as through firing a member of the cabinet. An example of this is the Night of Long Knives in 1962 where Macmillan sacked a third of his cabinet. Nevertheless, Machiavelli ignored individualism and had one sided views of human nature which can be viewed as a critical flaw.<nl><nl>For Machiavelli, law is also impossible to follow without the required military as arms are a requirement in order for leaders to establish great frameworks. Although it can be criticised as we do not follow medieval combat, there are still some aspects which apply to the modern state, for instance the concept that an army from your own principality is most beneficial for defending yourself \u2013 and this concept is universally accepted. Machiavelli also made the point that there is conflict of interest which can be seen in the modern state also, for example through the leak of the Panama papers. What is also seen in the modern state is Machiavelli\u2019s view on auxiliary troops being faithful to someone else, for example through the rise of the Taliban, as although it was intended for the Taliban to fight the Soviet Union, they later turned and became the lead terrorist group. In Antonio Negri\u2019s view, Machiavelli belongs to a \u2018political alternative of modern thought grounded on a revolutionary version of constituent power\u2019 (Negri and Maurizia Boscagli, 2009). However, Quentin Skinner and J.G.A Pocock write that we should regard Machiavelli as part of the republican tradition, i.e. as part of the living legacy of Aristotelian philosophy (Roecklein, 2012). Nonetheless, Machiavelli was the first modern thinker to have thought of the State as an independent entity and not recognising any religious organisation exterior to it and The Prince has been a choice of several political leaders such as Louis XIV, Napoleon Bonaparte and Benito Mussolini. <nl><nl>The modern state was \u2018constituted by an abstraction from personal to impersonal rule\u2019 (Mansfield, 1983). With Machiavelli we encounter a challenge to the classical regime which is expressed in his use of stato (his stato is someone\u2019s to acquire), whereas for Aristotle\u2019s regime there is some ordering of the inhabitants of the city. The central theme of Machiavelli\u2019s political ideas is power with absolute state being the end. The state is viewed as superior to all associations and is sovereign as well as autonomous however he also stated that religion cannot influence politics and the church cannot control the state, which is not the case. <nl><nl>Comparing Machiavelli to other theorists allows for us to critically evaluate him further. Plato had the vision of every human being born into a division which was maintained and creating an arrangement for the state in the course of classism whereas Machiavelli proposed with the aim of sovereignty to support the nation in which the leader controls and protects its citizens. Machiavelli\u2019s concept of virt\u00fa highlights the utilitarian needs of the country. For Machiavelli virt\u00fa outweighs virtue in times of need whilst Plato believes a \u2018just ruler must behave the same at all times\u2019 however we have to consider they were writing in different eras, as Plato\u2019s philosophy is based on utopian principles and Machiavelli is viewed as a realist (Abrams, M, 2017). Aristotle divides government into two categories: good and bad with good forms fall aristocracy and under bad fall oligarchy. Aristotle wanted to help society achieve goodness through politics whereas on the other hand Machiavelli sought to achieve the maintenance of power and stability. They have differing views in terms of Aristotle claimed that if an entire state is made to fear their ruler, this would cause unhappiness however Machiavelli suggested that it is better to be feared than loved as it creates balance. However, they are on similar sides when it comes to liberation, as in the Prince it stated such ruler should not dictate the actions of others, but all together Machiavelli was seeking a practical type of politics whilst Aristotle took a rather idealistic approach (Tabone, 2020).  <nl><nl>Hobbes and Machiavelli have fascinating ideas on human nature impacting the state as the common theme is the usage of fear, meaning power needs to be acquired and maintained but we have to remember that Machiavelli\u2019s time period involved the peak of absolutism and hierarchies. Philosophers such a John Locke have directly opposing views on government. Locke\u2019s perception of revolt as a right gave people excessive power compared to the government, this did not exist during the time of Machiavelli. Locke believed in the idea of the government working for the people, however this is directly opposed to Machiavelli\u2019s thought that the ruler should do what it takes to remain in power (Chris Joseph, 2014). Machiavelli recommended that coercion should be used in order to govern whereas Locke favoured a social contract with the concept of dual accountability. Although Machiavelli\u2019s concept of coercion is flawed, he did recognise that rulers could not govern by this alone and advocated for the use of cunning and subterfuge, Locke\u2019s social contract did not contain an element of this. Machiavelli had a pessimistic view of individuals and believed human beings are fundamentally bad whereas Locke was more optimistic. In the modern state it follows Machiavelli\u2019s model more as the rulers in the modern state are comprised of the rich and powerful in society. Mill and Machiavelli also have the same solution to government in freedom of speech, they are both aware that people cannot have a hand in ruling itself. <nl><nl>Political leaders and their followers believed that Machiavellism was a disease infesting the politic body. He is still regarded with a negative reputation, but he still aids us to understand the modern state. Machiavelli promoted the central role of a citizen in preserving institutions which is reflected through the meaning of the Second Amendment in the U.S. Constitution (Bernard, 2009). Among modern believers of Machiavelli, there are Burmese generals such as Web Jiabao, the Former Premier of China and Lord Mandelson (Bernard, 2009). Machiavelli and Pareto agree in terms of this where they say egotism or selfishness as a natural property of the human species (Femia, 2013). According to Machiavellism though, the principle aim of prince is the unification as well as welfare of the state which showed reality of practical politics. He deduced that the internal unity and powerful government were the essential of any state by observing the affairs of the interstate rivalries. The sole aim of the prince is also to increase power in ways such as to be an expert in managing and organising a war- power is seen as the only reason of the state. <nl><nl>To conclude Machiavelli contributes to the \u2018comprehension of constituent power as a living force within social order\u2019 (Lucchese, 2016). He developed a revolutionary position, suggesting that political conflict is not a destabilising factor, but rather the grounding force of free republics. His concepts and ideas are often misunderstood as he displayed rare intellect to become a partisan in an age where absolute monarchy held control (Mathur, 1991). All together Machiavelli was the first thinker who justified secular state and the first advocate for autonomy for the state. He unfairly became associated with evil through his critical work written about The Prince, and although it did not get translated until almost a hundred years later the negative view about Machiavelli had already been established into Elizabethan England. All together he communicated priority to the state and put it above morality and religion as it is the highest form of social organisation and most essential to promote human welfare, and this is seen clearly in the modern state. Machiavelli\u2019s Prince dealt exclusively with the interests of a single person of power that focuses on only the leader\u2019s welfare in mind whereas the theories of Plato, Aristotle, Locke and Mill dealt with the welfare of society. However, in the modern state there Machiavelli did consider that the Prince needed to maintain good relations with the people which is what we observe. It can be agreed the way that Machiavelli talks about the state as Machiavelli was a realist.", "I think I have decided with regards to the <tattoo_design> tattoo that once it is healed if it is possible to just have it lasered off?

Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961). This definition further criticizes religion as something which individuals turn to out of worry and desperation.<nl>In addition to the functional definitions of religion which can be seen above, there is also the substantive definition of religion which can be investigated. Substantive definitions tend to define religion in terms of its content rather than its function. Here, it is common for the existence of a \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018supernatural being\u2019 to be present when defining religion. This can be seen in Roland Robertsons definition of religion, where he states that \u2018religion refers to the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life\u2019 (Robertson, 1970). Such definitions however, can be seen as problematic to the wider community. This definition of religion by Robertson, clearly necessitates the existence of a god, and rejects any ideas that do not have a \u2018god\u2019 at the centre of their ideology to be classed as religion. This would not allow for beliefs such as Buddhism to be categorised as a religion, due to the fact that it is not based upon the concept of a creator- God (Gethin, 1998). Robertson\u2019s view on religion is supported by Max Weber, who also uses a substantive concept of religion, seeing it as a belief in a divine entity which cannot be explained scientifically (Weber, 2009). In other words, the belief in a god is required for a concept to be deemed as a religion. Ronald Dworkin however, opposes this notion and states that \u2018religion, does not necessarily mean a belief in god\u2019 and \u2018religion is an interpretive concept\u2019 (Dworkin, 2013). Dworkins use of the word \u2018interpretive\u2019, infers that religion can have a different meaning, dependent on the individual. Buddhism has now been linked to the global category of a world religion (McMahan, 2012), causing much debate upon what constitutes religion. This begs the question, who has set the requirements for what can and cannot be defined as a religion? Who has the right to dictate this? As Aldridge states \u2018Defining religion involves an exercise of power\u2019 (Aldridge, 2007).<nl><nl>Religion in International Relations- Post Secularization and Foreign Policy <nl>Often, when analysing religion within the international relations scene it can be deemed an aspect which is hastily overlooked. Religion is rarely included in most major theories of international relations and this can be ascribed to major Western social thinkers rejecting the notion of religion (Fox and Sandler, 2004), as discussed previously. As a particular scholar illustrated , \u2018the role of religion in explaining attitudes toward issues of international relations is somewhat limited\u2019 (Jelen, 1994). However, when further analysing international relations and conflict, it is clear that religion can be seen as a crucial element which should not be disregarded. It has been said that \u2018Domestic conflicts, including religious conflicts are becoming increasingly international issues\u2019 (Fox and Sandler, 2004). This extract from \u2018Bringing religion into International Relations\u2019, further emphasis the vital role that religion can play when assessing international relations. Examples of conflict which involve religion are The Israel Palestine conflict and the Thirty Years war. Here, religion can be key in resolving and understanding the clash, possibly presenting a recourse. <nl>Post secularization, it has been noted that a global resurgence of religion is transforming our understanding of international relations (Thomas, 2005). As there has been an increase in religious actors, it has recently become a vital analytical focus (Haynes,2005). These religious actors can include examples such as foreign policy taking into account religion, as well as transnational factors. The more that religion begins to play a pivotal role in making country decisions, the more clarity there is on what a substantial role religion plays on the international scene. There has previously been a narrative which has pushed the notion that the term \u2018religion\u2019 carries negative connotations and only leads to tension and ferocity, bringing nothing of substance to the international relations division. This adheres to the \u2018Westphalian presumption\u2019, which holds that \u2018religious and cultural pluralism cannot be accommodated in international public life\u2019 (Thomas, 2005). In other words, faith must be conceived as an internal matter to the sovereign state in order to avoid the risk of potential religious wars. This has encouraged using scientific knowledge and clear reasoning as justification for decisions over religion. It is clear that during these strongly secular times, there wasn\u2019t a want to define the term \u2018religion\u2019 from an international perspective. However, as religion began to make a return to the international scene, events such as 911 and Samuel Huntingtons\u2019 famous \u2018The clash of civilizations?\u2019 thesis (Huntington, 2000), only drew more attention to the importance of religion on the international relations front. As there was deemed to be a rise in religious clash and issues, with pivotal events such as 911, the topic of religion had to be assessed on the international scale. <nl>Many would also agree that religion has an important role to play in creating and shaping beliefs, which may in turn influence the formulation of state policy and foreign policy considerations. An instance of this can be seen with President George W. Bush, where he referred to the US having a \u2018calling\u2019 and \u2018mission\u2019 by the \u2018Maker of heaven\u2019 in his speeches on Foreign Policy (Judis, 2005). Not only can it be inferred here that George Bush is attempting to appeal to his majority audience with his \u2018faithful\u2019 language, but his references to God here explain how religion has had a direct impact on the foreign policy choices made. Bush\u2019s choice of language and rhetoric is extremely influential in shaping perspectives of the US citizens opinions on foreign policy. It was found here that there was a clear link between religion and opinion on U.S foreign policy in the Middle East (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). In particular, Evangelical Christians are more supportive of Bush\u2019s Foreign policy on the Iraq war and his foreign policy in general (Pew Research Centre, 2020). In a specific study carried out by Pew Research Centre, even after adjusting for the identity of the respondents groups, the impact of Evangelical beliefs towards foreign policy towards the Middle East remained statistically important (Pew Research Centre, 2020). These results are significant as they provide confirmatory proof that the position of Evangelical affiliation in shaping public opinion on foreign policy is important. It is also fundamental in understanding what a large effect a single religious group can have on how a country is run. The Middle East and President George Bush are a great area of focus due to the Iraq war being a matter which has concerned wide-spread public opinion since 2003 (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). As Boyer stated \u2018For many believers in biblical prophecy, the Bush administration\u2019s go-it-alone foreign policy, hands-off attitude toward the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and proposed war on Iraq, are not simply actions in the national self-interest or an extension of the war on terrorism, but part of an unfolding divine plan\u2019 (Boyer, 2003). This quote highlights how it is recognised that many individuals feel as though these conflicts directly involve religion and god, not only country policy. This infers that individuals will use faith as a major indicator when deciding their stance on subjects such as the Iraq war and foreign policy. On the contrary, research from the Pew Research centre suggests that people feel as though their faith does not define their opinion on the Iraq War (Different Faiths, Different Messages, 2020). Either way, the fact that there is much debate around religion probes several questions on the topic of faith, making it a valid matter when discussing international relations. As religion is increasingly being used for justification as well as indication, it is an important matter to consider on the international scene. \u00a8<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, when looking at definitions of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the context of both Sociology and International relations, it is obvious that there is much debate around what the word entails and its specific effects on society, good or bad. It is clear however, that religion has played a large role in shaping and moulding the current societies that we live in today, as well as the international relations scene, be it secular or not. Although there may be much debate upon whether the consequences of religion are \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 and \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019, the simple fact that decisions have and are being made based upon this, make it a crucial element that must be taken into consideration when looking at both society and international relations. There is no doubt that further research in the field of religion is vital and needed in order for a wider understanding of religion and its impact in both contexts.", "Oh, erm, I would say  <continental_adj>  dishes.

Due to contralateral processing, P3 should remain inattentive when shown a stimuli on the left. By using EEG, alpha activity can be recorded when shown a stimuli cued left or cued right. Event markers allow for it to be clear when the participant is shown the stimuli, and the alpha activity was recorded. The results showed that there was a significantly higher in left than right cue condition, and supported the hypothesis.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha activity refers to electrical impulses oscillating at 8-13Hz , this is an alpha wave. These brain waves begin in the cerebral cortex (Moini &amp; Piran, 2020) and occur during periods of inattention, where one is in a restful state, whilst being awake, examples of this is when closing eyes, meditating (Lagopoulos et al., 2009), daydreaming etc.  When the brain begins to focus on stimuli, alpha waves are suppressed. The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007), proposes that high alpha indicates disengagement and inhibition of task irrelevant brain areas. In task relevant brain areas, alpha remains low, supporting that alpha activity is modulated by attention.  <nl><nl>This hypothesis is supported by Magosso et al, 2019, which used a regular setting and a VR (virtual reality) setting to see if the intensity of the task and the levels of attention required affects alpha frequency. The results showed that alpha signals are suppressed when having to give attention to tasks although it seems that when isolated from all external features (when participating in VR) alpha activity becomes greater. This suggests that it is the modulation and diversion of attention which causes changes in alpha frequencies.<nl><nl>Sauseng et al (2005) presented participants with directional cues indicating which hemifield the target stimuli would appear in. The target stimuli consisted of either small or large bars which participants identified and responded with \u2018s\u2019 for small and \u2018l\u2019 for large. Results showed that there was stronger alpha frequency suppression in brain areas contralateral to the targeted hemifield. This is due to visual stimuli being processed contralaterally. 200ms before the stimuli was presented, in active processing areas like the parietal lobe (P3), the alpha range is also lower. This study is supportive of AIM (Klimesch et al, 2007), and is used as the basis for this experiment, as it is a partial replication. In this experiment, the focus will be on the effect of arrow cues, specifically the direction they are facing.<nl><nl>Hypothesis<nl>As AIH states, alpha range activity is present in areas that are uninvolved in active processing and is suppressed in areas that actively process. By directing attention, and cueing the participant to expect the stimuli in a specific region they will begin paying attention. As shown by Sauseng et al (2005), visual stimuli is processed contralaterally resulting in alpha suppression in the other side of the brain. For example, if the stimuli is present in the left visual field it will be processed by the right hemisphere. By using the left parietal cortex (P3) to record alpha activity, it is expected that alpha activity will be greater when a stimulus is shown on the left and for this activity to be suppressed when the stimuli is on the right.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 undergraduate students were participants chosen from an opportunity sample.<nl><nl>Design<nl>This experiment uses a within subjects design.

From the \u2018analog\u2019 tab select Electroencaphagram (EEG)\u2019 \u20180.5-100Hz wnotch\u2019, so the 50Hz band is filtered out. Digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker.. The \u2018calculation\u2019 tab allowed alpha frequency to be recorded. Then select \u2018EEG alpha 8-13Hz\u2019 from the drop down list. The sampling rate was 1000Hz. The participant was then prepared to be attached to the EEG. The electrode sites were abraded with everi cream using a cotton bud, and then AC cream was put on the electrodes. The electrodes are placed using the 1020 system. The active electrode was placed on P3. Participants were then given a cued visual task. A fixation cross was cued at the centre of the screen for 34ms, followed by an arrow indicating where to focus attention, with a 50% chance of it being cued left or right. There was then an interval of 600-800ms followed by a fixation cross for the second time, finally the participant was shown the target stimuli for 50ms, either a large or small white bar against a black background. Participants were then asked to use the keyboard to respond to the stimuli, typing either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. 75% of the trials were valid (the target stimuli was presented in the same hemifield that the arrow cue indicated), and 25% were invalid (the target stimuli was presented in the other hemifield). There were 20 blocks of the four trial types (cue left with a small bar, cue right with a small bar, cue left with a large bar and cue right with a large bar) so in total there were 80 trials.<nl><nl>Results<nl>There were transformations applied to the raw 9-13Hz alpha EEG data. There were eventmarkers received by PsychoPy through the Stimtracker, in order to identify when the stimuli was presented to the participants. The data also was used to specifically analyse from 200ms prior to stimulus onset after the directional arrow cues had been shown. Furthermore, the data was rectified, making negative values positive despite them showing excitatory or inhibitory activity. The samples were also averaged in order to limit the impact that outlying values would have on the data. This data is referred to as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl><nl>Descriptive Statistics<nl><table><nl><nl>Inferential Statistics <nl>The wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T=566, n=38, p=.002).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results of this experiment show that there was a significantly higher level of alpha activity when the stimulus was shown on the left hand side, this fit the original hypothesis. These results are consistent with AIH (Klimesch et al, 2007) as it shows that when participants are given a stimulus in their left hemifield, due to contralateral processing, this is processed by the right part of brain areas. As we were looking at P3, the left side of the parietal lobe, when shown a cue on the left it was processed on the right, meaning the left was task irrelevant and inattentive, resulting in higher alpha activity.<nl><nl>Methodological Problems<nl>Factors which may have confounded data include artefacts, which is when the EEG is contaminated by excess movement. When eye movements take place, the electrical activity could be recorded as brain activity. Eye movements could be blinking or horizontal eye movement, especially when having to look at either side of the screen. Blinking could also pose other issues such as the participant missing the cue. However, it does not seem to be too much of an issue and repetition and more trials would minimise the effects of this.<nl>Another issue could be the laboratory setting, as this could have an affect on brain activity. This is not a very normal situation for participants to be placed in so they may be uncomfortable or more alert as they know they are being studied. This could impact the EEG recordings as it is not a life-like situation so the results may not be generalisable to the whole population.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Overall, the data is valid despite minor methodological issues, which after replication can minimise the effect of individual differences, such as blinking and horizontal eye movement. The data also supports AIH and produced the expected results.", "Favourite cuisine. Erm, I'm not really sure I have one but, mm, I\u2019ve recently got into, erm, Chinese food recently, recently.

The nature of social media aids the ability for societal norms to not only be fueled and accepted across various cultures but also enable this to occur at an accelerated pace. However, the media has been proven to impact self-evaluation in a negative way. For example, there are numerous studies looking at women\u2019s self-evaluation, comparing weight-esteem based on neutral images or ideal images (Brown, Novick, Lord, &amp; Richards, 1992); self-worth based on social comparison (Jones &amp; Buckingham, 2005) etc. Unfortunately, looking at the effects on self-worth in men is minimal. This may be due to the rhetoric that portrays men as emotionless and when any type of emotion is displayed, idioms and phrases like \u2018be a man\u2019 or \u2018stop being a baby\u2019 comes into play. Due to this societal norm, it may make it difficult for men to be able to find appropriate support online and on social media platforms when struggling with the negative impact these sites can have on self worth. It is more acceptable for women to seek help online however, there is less support for men. By researching further into the impacts social media has on men\u2019s self worth, it can enable men to feel more comfortable when facing these issues. The research can aid understanding of this and also result in this topic becoming less taboo, giving a better chance for men to talk freely about their experiences.<nl><nl>I have investigated men\u2019s self worth in the context of social media and my main research question is \u2018How do young men talk about self worth within the context of social media (18-25)?\u2019. My method of analysis is discourse analysis as it allows for in-depth analysis into not only my participant\u2019s language use to construct ideas but also intonation. The interview will take place over a \u2018Zoom\u2019 video call, therefore I am able to have a video recording of all my participants' answers. <nl><nl>AnalysisResults<nl><nl>Through annotating my transcript I was able to select prominent themes that were discussed by my participant in the interview. These themes are spoken of throughout the interview and appear multiple times, even in different questions. From my initial question (line 7) I was able to determine that my participant is an avid user of social media, using it for entertainment purposes as well as using various platforms. This ensures that the questions I ask are relevant to my participant and the answers reflect their social media usage. <nl><nl>Key themes that were discussed by my participant include \"the ideal man\", involving image, appearance and social status; also \"alternate reality\", discussing not only the falseness of social media but also the construction of one's image on social media platforms.<nl><nl>The Ideal Man<nl><nl>The idea of \u2018the ideal man\u2019 featured within my participants answers multiple times, with a construction of what they personally believe to be the ideal man. As opposed to referring to what my participant feels they should look like, my participant instead suggests what others \"should be looking for\" (line 174) in a man, for example, the ideal height \"6 foot 4, or over 6 foot\" (line 175),  the ideal body, having \"six packs\" (line 138), adequate facial hair \"beard\" (line 176) etc. This is a very specific portrayal of men, suggesting that this is a common image for men to hold and strive to achieve. Although men do have an idea of what the ideal body type is they are also aware that in general life, this may not always be the case, with my participant stating that \"It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of me. It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of anyone I know.\" (line 162-163) when asked if he felt represented by men on social media. However, despite this acknowledgement, my participant still felt uncomfortable for comparisons between the appearance of men on social media and himself. My participant used the phrase \"I\u2019d prefer just to leave it at that\" (lines 161 and 294) indicating that men do feel uncomfortable about discussing their appearance, which supports the taboo of men expressing self-doubt and lacking self worth and lowered confidence. This would explain why my participant referred to other people he knows whenever talking about personal appearance, in order to make his answer generalised as opposed to solely him as well as deflect the discomfort about the fact that he is not the ideal man by justifying it with the fact that most people do not look like that. This is supported when he says \"I don\u2019t think many men would want to admit, especially among their peers, wouldn\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re not the ideal person.\" (lines 354-355) <nl><nl>In addition to the body image, a man\u2019s social status and financial status also seems to be prevalent when it comes to describing the \u2018ideal man\u2019 with my participant referring to men with \"seven figures\" (line 138), and men who have \"lavish\" (line 81 ) lifestyles. A given example was the actor and influencer \u2018Dan Bilzerian\u2019; well known for \"constantly flaunting a bunch of money\" (line 241) and \"constantly surrounded by money\". (line 242) This was someone who my participant would refer to as a \u2018role model\u2019 for most males. My participant also referred to the fact that \"men can be successful on social media without looking the greatest\" (line 225), due to their social and financial status. This is supported by the evolutionary psychology theory that women will desire men who are able to provide stability, in the forms of shelter, money, food etc. (Li, Li, Chan &amp; Zhang, 2016). This would explain that now in the digital age, men are able to attract attention with their wealth via social media through posting \"lavish\" (line 81) objects. As it is now commonplace for influencers to be posting this type of content, as my participant stated, \"ordinary people might look at that and think \u2018Well, that\u2019s not me\u2019.\"(line  So this becomes the new goals and the new norm. It is evident that the fact that my participant did not relate to these standards, as when asked if he felt represented by these role models and depictions of men he stated \"No. No. No. No I don\u2019t.\" (line 156) Being unable to relate to the norm often results in incongruence between one's actual self and ideal self which may lower self worth.

My participant referred to social media in very negative ways, and suggested it is a \"toxic\" (line 136) place, despite spending around \"5 hours\" (line 15) per day. This is not an uncommon amount of time on social media, however spending this much time surrounded by something that is perceived as negative by my participant, it is unsurprising that his self confidence is impacted. Also, despite this awareness of the fact that not everything is quite what it seems on social media, the standards are still internalised. This suggests that regardless of the reality or the accuracy of the things that one may be exposed to, they are still accepted by people and becomes the societal norm. My participant also refers to the fact that women are more educated about the ways images are distorted online as opposed to enhancements and photoshop for men.  <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl><nl>From my research, it is evident that despite being aware of the falseness and unrealistic standards of social media, it is evident that young men\u2019s self worth is impacted negatively by the content they are exposed to on social media. Despite being adamant that they are aware of the one sidedness of social media, men continue to make comparisons and draw from this to bring into real life situations. This makes it clear that men experience lowered self confidence not only looks wise but also based on their financial status, social status and more materialistic things. My research has also made it clear that men also feel pressure, and more should be done in terms of support for men online. However, regardless of the gender, social media does tend to display only positive events, making it harder for regular people to accept other events and negative things in real life.", "Go to order.

My participant also refers to the fact that women are more educated about the ways images are distorted online as opposed to enhancements and photoshop for men.  <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl><nl>From my research, it is evident that despite being aware of the falseness and unrealistic standards of social media, it is evident that young men\u2019s self worth is impacted negatively by the content they are exposed to on social media. Despite being adamant that they are aware of the one sidedness of social media, men continue to make comparisons and draw from this to bring into real life situations. This makes it clear that men experience lowered self confidence not only looks wise but also based on their financial status, social status and more materialistic things. My research has also made it clear that men also feel pressure, and more should be done in terms of support for men online. However, regardless of the gender, social media does tend to display only positive events, making it harder for regular people to accept other events and negative things in real life.", "So in the image one there\u2019s er, two people.

I'm writing this email on behalf of us all in regards to the maintenance of the house.<nl><nl>Firstly, the fridge has been a recurring problem. This is because from day one it has always been difficult to fully close it - partly due to the design of the cupboard door and the fact that the freezer isn\u2019t working properly and as a result the ice builds up and doesn\u2019t allow it to close. This further prevents the fridge from closing properly in addition to the cupboard design door. This ongoing issue has resulted in numerous amounts of food not being kept properly and the unfortunate throwing away of them. We are all experiencing hard times as we attempt to continue living with COVID19, therefore the continuous cycle of buying food and it going off due to a dysfucntional and ineffective fridge makes these times just that much harder.<nl><nl>A contractor was sent out once and the service he provided was not good enough as this is still a very important issue - if not the most important as it directly effects our health and safety.<nl><nl>Another issue in the kitchen is that one of the lower cabinet doors has come off. I believe the inside components have snapped and the repair will require new parts.<nl><nl>The last of the issues in the kitchen is the metal wall section behind the sink. The bottom part of it has opened and essentially began to peel off. This also needs to be fixed because if its allowed to continue peeling the wall behind it will start to get wet from the sink and cause further damage to the property.<nl><nl>In line with maintenance requests, it has also been brought to my attention that the top floor tenant is extremely unhappy with the mattress she is having to use as she says all she can feel is the springs within it. This causes severe joint and shoulder pain - again this is important as it has a direct impact on her health. If this could be replaced it would be most helpful, as we are timely paying tenants who don\u2019t believe this to be an unjust request.<nl><nl>I did contact the <business> property management mobile contact number ending 152, I was directed to report all maintenance issues through property file. However, we were not given access to this platform and so can\u2019t use it. I did reply and let the person know this but I received no reply to that message and the maintenance issues are still outstanding.<nl><nl>I look forward to what solutions you are able to offer and hope to hear from you soon.<nl><nl><part_FN_SN>"]}

Due to contralateral processing, P3 should remain inattentive when shown a stimuli on the left. By using EEG, alpha activity can be recorded when shown a stimuli cued left or cued right. Event markers allow for it to be clear when the participant is shown the stimuli, and the alpha activity was recorded. The results showed that there was a significantly higher in left than right cue condition, and supported the hypothesis.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha activity refers to electrical impulses oscillating at 8-13Hz , this is an alpha wave. These brain waves begin in the cerebral cortex (Moini &amp; Piran, 2020) and occur during periods of inattention, where one is in a restful state, whilst being awake, examples of this is when closing eyes, meditating (Lagopoulos et al., 2009), daydreaming etc.  When the brain begins to focus on stimuli, alpha waves are suppressed. The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007), proposes that high alpha indicates disengagement and inhibition of task irrelevant brain areas. In task relevant brain areas, alpha remains low, supporting that alpha activity is modulated by attention.  <nl><nl>This hypothesis is supported by Magosso et al, 2019, which used a regular setting and a VR (virtual reality) setting to see if the intensity of the task and the levels of attention required affects alpha frequency. The results showed that alpha signals are suppressed when having to give attention to tasks although it seems that when isolated from all external features (when participating in VR) alpha activity becomes greater. This suggests that it is the modulation and diversion of attention which causes changes in alpha frequencies.<nl><nl>Sauseng et al (2005) presented participants with directional cues indicating which hemifield the target stimuli would appear in. The target stimuli consisted of either small or large bars which participants identified and responded with \u2018s\u2019 for small and \u2018l\u2019 for large. Results showed that there was stronger alpha frequency suppression in brain areas contralateral to the targeted hemifield. This is due to visual stimuli being processed contralaterally. 200ms before the stimuli was presented, in active processing areas like the parietal lobe (P3), the alpha range is also lower. This study is supportive of AIM (Klimesch et al, 2007), and is used as the basis for this experiment, as it is a partial replication. In this experiment, the focus will be on the effect of arrow cues, specifically the direction they are facing.<nl><nl>Hypothesis<nl>As AIH states, alpha range activity is present in areas that are uninvolved in active processing and is suppressed in areas that actively process. By directing attention, and cueing the participant to expect the stimuli in a specific region they will begin paying attention. As shown by Sauseng et al (2005), visual stimuli is processed contralaterally resulting in alpha suppression in the other side of the brain. For example, if the stimuli is present in the left visual field it will be processed by the right hemisphere. By using the left parietal cortex (P3) to record alpha activity, it is expected that alpha activity will be greater when a stimulus is shown on the left and for this activity to be suppressed when the stimuli is on the right.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 undergraduate students were participants chosen from an opportunity sample.<nl><nl>Design<nl>This experiment uses a within subjects design. The dependent variable is the alpha range amplitudes (microvolts) on the left hand side of the parietal lobe (P3). The independent variable is the direction of the arrow cue, with two levels, left or right. <nl>Materials<nl>This experiment used a Biopac MP36 to collect data, EEG electrodes, AC Cream, Abrasive paste, PsychoPy to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device and stimuli (see figure 1). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG by opening the Biopac student lab. From the \u2018analog\u2019 tab select Electroencaphagram (EEG)\u2019 \u20180.5-100Hz wnotch\u2019, so the 50Hz band is filtered out. Digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker.. The \u2018calculation\u2019 tab allowed alpha frequency to be recorded. Then select \u2018EEG alpha 8-13Hz\u2019 from the drop down list. The sampling rate was 1000Hz. The participant was then prepared to be attached to the EEG. The electrode sites were abraded with everi cream using a cotton bud, and then AC cream was put on the electrodes. The electrodes are placed using the 1020 system. The active electrode was placed on P3. Participants were then given a cued visual task. A fixation cross was cued at the centre of the screen for 34ms, followed by an arrow indicating where to focus attention, with a 50% chance of it being cued left or right. There was then an interval of 600-800ms followed by a fixation cross for the second time, finally the participant was shown the target stimuli for 50ms, either a large or small white bar against a black background. Participants were then asked to use the keyboard to respond to the stimuli, typing either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. 75% of the trials were valid (the target stimuli was presented in the same hemifield that the arrow cue indicated), and 25% were invalid (the target stimuli was presented in the other hemifield). There were 20 blocks of the four trial types (cue left with a small bar, cue right with a small bar, cue left with a large bar and cue right with a large bar) so in total there were 80 trials.<nl><nl>Results<nl>There were transformations applied to the raw 9-13Hz alpha EEG data. There were eventmarkers received by PsychoPy through the Stimtracker, in order to identify when the stimuli was presented to the participants. The data also was used to specifically analyse from 200ms prior to stimulus onset after the directional arrow cues had been shown. Furthermore, the data was rectified, making negative values positive despite them showing excitatory or inhibitory activity. The samples were also averaged in order to limit the impact that outlying values would have on the data. This data is referred to as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl><nl>Descriptive Statistics<nl><table><nl><nl>Inferential Statistics <nl>The wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T=566, n=38, p=.002).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results of this experiment show that there was a significantly higher level of alpha activity when the stimulus was shown on the left hand side, this fit the original hypothesis. These results are consistent with AIH (Klimesch et al, 2007) as it shows that when participants are given a stimulus in their left hemifield, due to contralateral processing, this is processed by the right part of brain areas. As we were looking at P3, the left side of the parietal lobe, when shown a cue on the left it was processed on the right, meaning the left was task irrelevant and inattentive, resulting in higher alpha activity.<nl><nl>Methodological Problems<nl>Factors which may have confounded data include artefacts, which is when the EEG is contaminated by excess movement. When eye movements take place, the electrical activity could be recorded as brain activity. Eye movements could be blinking or horizontal eye movement, especially when having to look at either side of the screen. Blinking could also pose other issues such as the participant missing the cue. However, it does not seem to be too much of an issue and repetition and more trials would minimise the effects of this.<nl>Another issue could be the laboratory setting, as this could have an affect on brain activity. This is not a very normal situation for participants to be placed in so they may be uncomfortable or more alert as they know they are being studied. This could impact the EEG recordings as it is not a life-like situation so the results may not be generalisable to the whole population.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Overall, the data is valid despite minor methodological issues, which after replication can minimise the effect of individual differences, such as blinking and horizontal eye movement. The data also supports AIH and produced the expected results.", "Dear <addr14_FN>,<nl>I would like to attend the 2pm site tour.<nl>Thank you,<nl><part_FN><new>Dear <addr14_FN>,<nl>I am able to attend today.<nl>Thank you,<nl><part_FN><new>Dear Mrs. <addr15_SN>,<nl>I hope you and your family are well during these times.

So, I usually have, er, Maryland cookies or some type of random sweets or Twix or some type of candy or something and, er, usually with a Fanta on the side of it. So, I could wake up, go to the bathroom next door, brush my teeth and then come back, get a snack. So, that\u2019s just the start of the day as I'm just, you know, relaxing in my room. Then I\u2019ll go downstairs in about an hour or so, cook some breakfast so eggs, er, bread, beans, sausages and, you know, all the trimmings, bacon as well but I\u2019ve actually kind of reduced on that recently. So, then that\u2019s breakfast. And then usually, I\u2019d set off for the library so around, maybe, eleven, twelvish. And then, er, on the way to the library, I\u2019ll probably pick up a few things from  <supermarket1>  so, maybe, a meal deal and a few fruits and drinks and whatever. And then pretty much from midday till about five, maybe, I would have just had the meal deal and then I\u2019ll make my way home. And then when I get home, a cheeky little spaghetti bolognaise to start the night off. And then yeah, it just depends, really, when I sleep when I have my next meal but really and truly, it\u2019s probably another sort of snack, yeah. <new>In terms of, er, which one do I like the most or which one is most beneficial to me?<new>Oh. Before like, erm, I\u2019ve always liked breakfast, it\u2019s always been my, it\u2019s always been my favourite meal of the day, \u2018cause I, I, I learnt how to cook, erm, I learnt how to cook it quite early as well. I used to make eggs, the, the bread, the, warm up the beans, you know, I, I liked cooking breakfast. So, I would say yeah, that\u2019s the one I enjoy the most and yeah, I do think it is the most important as well, actually. Yeah, it sets up your day, you know?<new>I would say, mm, what\u2019s my favourite dish? Probably Sunday roast, I would say, yeah. And my mum makes it quite nice, actually, so. And it\u2019s not even just on Sundays we have it. In a week, typically, you\u2019d have it about twice. So, yeah, that is my favourite, with the potatoes, the sausages, chipolatas, to be specific. Chipolatas, er, gravy next to it, broccoli, carrots and, yeah, that\u2019s my favourite meal I would say."]}

Erm, then I\u2019ll probably get on with some work and bits and then I\u2019ll have, always have a snack. I love to eat; I should probably say that now. Erm, so, I\u2019ll have like a, a snack, erm, that\u2019ll just be like, maybe, some fruit or something just snacky, a packet of crisps or something. Erm, then lunch. I, or I guess it\u2019s more dinner. I tend to, I\u2019d say I eat two meals a day, like main meals. Erm, so dinner I would have, I would cook something so either, erm, I don\u2019t know, maybe a curry or a stir fry, erm, whatever I\u2019m fancying, really. I\u2019ll try to have like some protein and a balanced a meal as much as I can, unless I just want a takeaway and just want to be free  <laugh> , yeah.<new>We have to pick one?<new>Okay. So, I\u2019d probably say my final meal of the day, erm, because I feel like, this is just me personally, but I tend to get, I tend to be more hungry toward the end of the day. I guess it\u2019s just because I\u2019ve, you know, released a lot of energy and done a lot during the day. Erm, I could probably, if I really wanted to, not even eat my first meal, but come the end of the day, I\u2019m ready to like tuck into a good feast, yeah.<new>Oh. Erm, ah, my God, that\u2019s such a hard question. I\u2019d say my favourite cuisine is like American, so like steak and burgers and, erm, yeah, food like that. Erm, but I also love like spicy food so just like really flavourful food. Erm, yeah.<new>Erm, I mean, it\u2019s not the healthiest so probably not as often as I want  <laugh> .

Due to contralateral processing, P3 should remain inattentive when shown a stimuli on the left. By using EEG, alpha activity can be recorded when shown a stimuli cued left or cued right. Event markers allow for it to be clear when the participant is shown the stimuli, and the alpha activity was recorded. The results showed that there was a significantly higher in left than right cue condition, and supported the hypothesis.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha activity refers to electrical impulses oscillating at 8-13Hz , this is an alpha wave. These brain waves begin in the cerebral cortex (Moini &amp; Piran, 2020) and occur during periods of inattention, where one is in a restful state, whilst being awake, examples of this is when closing eyes, meditating (Lagopoulos et al., 2009), daydreaming etc.  When the brain begins to focus on stimuli, alpha waves are suppressed. The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007), proposes that high alpha indicates disengagement and inhibition of task irrelevant brain areas. In task relevant brain areas, alpha remains low, supporting that alpha activity is modulated by attention.  <nl><nl>This hypothesis is supported by Magosso et al, 2019, which used a regular setting and a VR (virtual reality) setting to see if the intensity of the task and the levels of attention required affects alpha frequency. The results showed that alpha signals are suppressed when having to give attention to tasks although it seems that when isolated from all external features (when participating in VR) alpha activity becomes greater. This suggests that it is the modulation and diversion of attention which causes changes in alpha frequencies.<nl><nl>Sauseng et al (2005) presented participants with directional cues indicating which hemifield the target stimuli would appear in. The target stimuli consisted of either small or large bars which participants identified and responded with \u2018s\u2019 for small and \u2018l\u2019 for large. Results showed that there was stronger alpha frequency suppression in brain areas contralateral to the targeted hemifield. This is due to visual stimuli being processed contralaterally. 200ms before the stimuli was presented, in active processing areas like the parietal lobe (P3), the alpha range is also lower. This study is supportive of AIM (Klimesch et al, 2007), and is used as the basis for this experiment, as it is a partial replication. In this experiment, the focus will be on the effect of arrow cues, specifically the direction they are facing.<nl><nl>Hypothesis<nl>As AIH states, alpha range activity is present in areas that are uninvolved in active processing and is suppressed in areas that actively process. By directing attention, and cueing the participant to expect the stimuli in a specific region they will begin paying attention. As shown by Sauseng et al (2005), visual stimuli is processed contralaterally resulting in alpha suppression in the other side of the brain. For example, if the stimuli is present in the left visual field it will be processed by the right hemisphere. By using the left parietal cortex (P3) to record alpha activity, it is expected that alpha activity will be greater when a stimulus is shown on the left and for this activity to be suppressed when the stimuli is on the right.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 undergraduate students were participants chosen from an opportunity sample.<nl><nl>Design<nl>This experiment uses a within subjects design. The dependent variable is the alpha range amplitudes (microvolts) on the left hand side of the parietal lobe (P3). The independent variable is the direction of the arrow cue, with two levels, left or right. <nl>Materials<nl>This experiment used a Biopac MP36 to collect data, EEG electrodes, AC Cream, Abrasive paste, PsychoPy to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device and stimuli (see figure 1). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG by opening the Biopac student lab. From the \u2018analog\u2019 tab select Electroencaphagram (EEG)\u2019 \u20180.5-100Hz wnotch\u2019, so the 50Hz band is filtered out. Digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker.. The \u2018calculation\u2019 tab allowed alpha frequency to be recorded. Then select \u2018EEG alpha 8-13Hz\u2019 from the drop down list. The sampling rate was 1000Hz. The participant was then prepared to be attached to the EEG. The electrode sites were abraded with everi cream using a cotton bud, and then AC cream was put on the electrodes. The electrodes are placed using the 1020 system. The active electrode was placed on P3. Participants were then given a cued visual task. A fixation cross was cued at the centre of the screen for 34ms, followed by an arrow indicating where to focus attention, with a 50% chance of it being cued left or right. There was then an interval of 600-800ms followed by a fixation cross for the second time, finally the participant was shown the target stimuli for 50ms, either a large or small white bar against a black background. Participants were then asked to use the keyboard to respond to the stimuli, typing either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. 75% of the trials were valid (the target stimuli was presented in the same hemifield that the arrow cue indicated), and 25% were invalid (the target stimuli was presented in the other hemifield). There were 20 blocks of the four trial types (cue left with a small bar, cue right with a small bar, cue left with a large bar and cue right with a large bar) so in total there were 80 trials.<nl><nl>Results<nl>There were transformations applied to the raw 9-13Hz alpha EEG data. There were eventmarkers received by PsychoPy through the Stimtracker, in order to identify when the stimuli was presented to the participants. The data also was used to specifically analyse from 200ms prior to stimulus onset after the directional arrow cues had been shown. Furthermore, the data was rectified, making negative values positive despite them showing excitatory or inhibitory activity. The samples were also averaged in order to limit the impact that outlying values would have on the data. This data is referred to as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl><nl>Descriptive Statistics<nl><table><nl><nl>Inferential Statistics <nl>The wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T=566, n=38, p=.002).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results of this experiment show that there was a significantly higher level of alpha activity when the stimulus was shown on the left hand side, this fit the original hypothesis. These results are consistent with AIH (Klimesch et al, 2007) as it shows that when participants are given a stimulus in their left hemifield, due to contralateral processing, this is processed by the right part of brain areas. As we were looking at P3, the left side of the parietal lobe, when shown a cue on the left it was processed on the right, meaning the left was task irrelevant and inattentive, resulting in higher alpha activity.<nl><nl>Methodological Problems<nl>Factors which may have confounded data include artefacts, which is when the EEG is contaminated by excess movement. When eye movements take place, the electrical activity could be recorded as brain activity. Eye movements could be blinking or horizontal eye movement, especially when having to look at either side of the screen. Blinking could also pose other issues such as the participant missing the cue. However, it does not seem to be too much of an issue and repetition and more trials would minimise the effects of this.<nl>Another issue could be the laboratory setting, as this could have an affect on brain activity. This is not a very normal situation for participants to be placed in so they may be uncomfortable or more alert as they know they are being studied. This could impact the EEG recordings as it is not a life-like situation so the results may not be generalisable to the whole population.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Overall, the data is valid despite minor methodological issues, which after replication can minimise the effect of individual differences, such as blinking and horizontal eye movement.

And they\u2019re both, er, sitting behind a Mac, and they\u2019re just looking at the computer. So I think they might be computing students or some type of technology involved in their, er, degrees also. Erm, the laptop\u2019s actually on a black sort of coffee table. And erm, yeah, it just looks like they\u2019re students on the same sort of course and, you know, just doing a bit of work together. So that\u2019s image two. And in image three, the background is almost a circle of white beads, o- placed on a black, er, background board. And it\u2019s got two, er, people in it. Er, one, er female and one male. Erm, she\u2019s wearing a leather black jacket and he\u2019s also g- holding a book. And I do believe there might be a third person in the picture but they\u2019re just out of the scene. So yeah, they\u2019re sitting on a, I think it\u2019s a red or sort of er, a rose type couch, and er, they\u2019ve got a glass coffee table in front of them. Er, the man\u2019s got a beard and, er, he\u2019s smiling quite a bit, with a green top under his black, er, inspector gadget jacket,  <laugh>  some people would say. Erm, he\u2019s wearing some, er, brown khaki trousers \u2013 no, brown trousers, yeah. And er, the lady\u2019s wearing some brown boots with red leggings, I would say. Erm, you can\u2019t really see it too caref- too well, but er, she\u2019s got some earrings I think, that are dangling. So er, yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it. So yeah, I would say they\u2019re, they\u2019re both students as well, because they\u2019ve got a book. And er, I don\u2019t know who the third character in the picture is as we can\u2019t really see, but we can just see one of his hands. But yeah.

So, I usually have, er, Maryland cookies or some type of random sweets or Twix or some type of candy or something and, er, usually with a Fanta on the side of it. So, I could wake up, go to the bathroom next door, brush my teeth and then come back, get a snack. So, that\u2019s just the start of the day as I'm just, you know, relaxing in my room. Then I\u2019ll go downstairs in about an hour or so, cook some breakfast so eggs, er, bread, beans, sausages and, you know, all the trimmings, bacon as well but I\u2019ve actually kind of reduced on that recently. So, then that\u2019s breakfast. And then usually, I\u2019d set off for the library so around, maybe, eleven, twelvish. And then, er, on the way to the library, I\u2019ll probably pick up a few things from  <supermarket1>  so, maybe, a meal deal and a few fruits and drinks and whatever. And then pretty much from midday till about five, maybe, I would have just had the meal deal and then I\u2019ll make my way home. And then when I get home, a cheeky little spaghetti bolognaise to start the night off. And then yeah, it just depends, really, when I sleep when I have my next meal but really and truly, it\u2019s probably another sort of snack, yeah. <new>In terms of, er, which one do I like the most or which one is most beneficial to me?<new>Oh. Before like, erm, I\u2019ve always liked breakfast, it\u2019s always been my, it\u2019s always been my favourite meal of the day, \u2018cause I, I, I learnt how to cook, erm, I learnt how to cook it quite early as well. I used to make eggs, the, the bread, the, warm up the beans, you know, I, I liked cooking breakfast. So, I would say yeah, that\u2019s the one I enjoy the most and yeah, I do think it is the most important as well, actually. Yeah, it sets up your day, you know?<new>I would say, mm, what\u2019s my favourite dish? Probably Sunday roast, I would say, yeah. And my mum makes it quite nice, actually, so. And it\u2019s not even just on Sundays we have it. In a week, typically, you\u2019d have it about twice. So, yeah, that is my favourite, with the potatoes, the sausages, chipolatas, to be specific.

Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961). This definition further criticizes religion as something which individuals turn to out of worry and desperation.<nl>In addition to the functional definitions of religion which can be seen above, there is also the substantive definition of religion which can be investigated. Substantive definitions tend to define religion in terms of its content rather than its function. Here, it is common for the existence of a \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018supernatural being\u2019 to be present when defining religion. This can be seen in Roland Robertsons definition of religion, where he states that \u2018religion refers to the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life\u2019 (Robertson, 1970). Such definitions however, can be seen as problematic to the wider community. This definition of religion by Robertson, clearly necessitates the existence of a god, and rejects any ideas that do not have a \u2018god\u2019 at the centre of their ideology to be classed as religion. This would not allow for beliefs such as Buddhism to be categorised as a religion, due to the fact that it is not based upon the concept of a creator- God (Gethin, 1998). Robertson\u2019s view on religion is supported by Max Weber, who also uses a substantive concept of religion, seeing it as a belief in a divine entity which cannot be explained scientifically (Weber, 2009). In other words, the belief in a god is required for a concept to be deemed as a religion. Ronald Dworkin however, opposes this notion and states that \u2018religion, does not necessarily mean a belief in god\u2019 and \u2018religion is an interpretive concept\u2019 (Dworkin, 2013). Dworkins use of the word \u2018interpretive\u2019, infers that religion can have a different meaning, dependent on the individual. Buddhism has now been linked to the global category of a world religion (McMahan, 2012), causing much debate upon what constitutes religion. This begs the question, who has set the requirements for what can and cannot be defined as a religion? Who has the right to dictate this? As Aldridge states \u2018Defining religion involves an exercise of power\u2019 (Aldridge, 2007).<nl><nl>Religion in International Relations- Post Secularization and Foreign Policy <nl>Often, when analysing religion within the international relations scene it can be deemed an aspect which is hastily overlooked. Religion is rarely included in most major theories of international relations and this can be ascribed to major Western social thinkers rejecting the notion of religion (Fox and Sandler, 2004), as discussed previously. As a particular scholar illustrated , \u2018the role of religion in explaining attitudes toward issues of international relations is somewhat limited\u2019 (Jelen, 1994). However, when further analysing international relations and conflict, it is clear that religion can be seen as a crucial element which should not be disregarded. It has been said that \u2018Domestic conflicts, including religious conflicts are becoming increasingly international issues\u2019 (Fox and Sandler, 2004). This extract from \u2018Bringing religion into International Relations\u2019, further emphasis the vital role that religion can play when assessing international relations. Examples of conflict which involve religion are The Israel Palestine conflict and the Thirty Years war. Here, religion can be key in resolving and understanding the clash, possibly presenting a recourse. <nl>Post secularization, it has been noted that a global resurgence of religion is transforming our understanding of international relations (Thomas, 2005). As there has been an increase in religious actors, it has recently become a vital analytical focus (Haynes,2005). These religious actors can include examples such as foreign policy taking into account religion, as well as transnational factors. The more that religion begins to play a pivotal role in making country decisions, the more clarity there is on what a substantial role religion plays on the international scene. There has previously been a narrative which has pushed the notion that the term \u2018religion\u2019 carries negative connotations and only leads to tension and ferocity, bringing nothing of substance to the international relations division. This adheres to the \u2018Westphalian presumption\u2019, which holds that \u2018religious and cultural pluralism cannot be accommodated in international public life\u2019 (Thomas, 2005). In other words, faith must be conceived as an internal matter to the sovereign state in order to avoid the risk of potential religious wars. This has encouraged using scientific knowledge and clear reasoning as justification for decisions over religion. It is clear that during these strongly secular times, there wasn\u2019t a want to define the term \u2018religion\u2019 from an international perspective. However, as religion began to make a return to the international scene, events such as 911 and Samuel Huntingtons\u2019 famous \u2018The clash of civilizations?\u2019 thesis (Huntington, 2000), only drew more attention to the importance of religion on the international relations front. As there was deemed to be a rise in religious clash and issues, with pivotal events such as 911, the topic of religion had to be assessed on the international scale. <nl>Many would also agree that religion has an important role to play in creating and shaping beliefs, which may in turn influence the formulation of state policy and foreign policy considerations. An instance of this can be seen with President George W. Bush, where he referred to the US having a \u2018calling\u2019 and \u2018mission\u2019 by the \u2018Maker of heaven\u2019 in his speeches on Foreign Policy (Judis, 2005). Not only can it be inferred here that George Bush is attempting to appeal to his majority audience with his \u2018faithful\u2019 language, but his references to God here explain how religion has had a direct impact on the foreign policy choices made. Bush\u2019s choice of language and rhetoric is extremely influential in shaping perspectives of the US citizens opinions on foreign policy. It was found here that there was a clear link between religion and opinion on U.S foreign policy in the Middle East (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). In particular, Evangelical Christians are more supportive of Bush\u2019s Foreign policy on the Iraq war and his foreign policy in general (Pew Research Centre, 2020). In a specific study carried out by Pew Research Centre, even after adjusting for the identity of the respondents groups, the impact of Evangelical beliefs towards foreign policy towards the Middle East remained statistically important (Pew Research Centre, 2020). These results are significant as they provide confirmatory proof that the position of Evangelical affiliation in shaping public opinion on foreign policy is important. It is also fundamental in understanding what a large effect a single religious group can have on how a country is run. The Middle East and President George Bush are a great area of focus due to the Iraq war being a matter which has concerned wide-spread public opinion since 2003 (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). As Boyer stated \u2018For many believers in biblical prophecy, the Bush administration\u2019s go-it-alone foreign policy, hands-off attitude toward the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and proposed war on Iraq, are not simply actions in the national self-interest or an extension of the war on terrorism, but part of an unfolding divine plan\u2019 (Boyer, 2003). This quote highlights how it is recognised that many individuals feel as though these conflicts directly involve religion and god, not only country policy. This infers that individuals will use faith as a major indicator when deciding their stance on subjects such as the Iraq war and foreign policy. On the contrary, research from the Pew Research centre suggests that people feel as though their faith does not define their opinion on the Iraq War (Different Faiths, Different Messages, 2020). Either way, the fact that there is much debate around religion probes several questions on the topic of faith, making it a valid matter when discussing international relations. As religion is increasingly being used for justification as well as indication, it is an important matter to consider on the international scene. \u00a8<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, when looking at definitions of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the context of both Sociology and International relations, it is obvious that there is much debate around what the word entails and its specific effects on society, good or bad. It is clear however, that religion has played a large role in shaping and moulding the current societies that we live in today, as well as the international relations scene, be it secular or not. Although there may be much debate upon whether the consequences of religion are \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 and \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019, the simple fact that decisions have and are being made based upon this, make it a crucial element that must be taken into consideration when looking at both society and international relations. There is no doubt that further research in the field of religion is vital and needed in order for a wider understanding of religion and its impact in both contexts.", "Hi <addr8_FN>, <nl><nl>Hope you had a good weekend!

Due to contralateral processing, P3 should remain inattentive when shown a stimuli on the left. By using EEG, alpha activity can be recorded when shown a stimuli cued left or cued right. Event markers allow for it to be clear when the participant is shown the stimuli, and the alpha activity was recorded. The results showed that there was a significantly higher in left than right cue condition, and supported the hypothesis.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha activity refers to electrical impulses oscillating at 8-13Hz , this is an alpha wave. These brain waves begin in the cerebral cortex (Moini &amp; Piran, 2020) and occur during periods of inattention, where one is in a restful state, whilst being awake, examples of this is when closing eyes, meditating (Lagopoulos et al., 2009), daydreaming etc.  When the brain begins to focus on stimuli, alpha waves are suppressed. The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007), proposes that high alpha indicates disengagement and inhibition of task irrelevant brain areas. In task relevant brain areas, alpha remains low, supporting that alpha activity is modulated by attention.  <nl><nl>This hypothesis is supported by Magosso et al, 2019, which used a regular setting and a VR (virtual reality) setting to see if the intensity of the task and the levels of attention required affects alpha frequency. The results showed that alpha signals are suppressed when having to give attention to tasks although it seems that when isolated from all external features (when participating in VR) alpha activity becomes greater. This suggests that it is the modulation and diversion of attention which causes changes in alpha frequencies.<nl><nl>Sauseng et al (2005) presented participants with directional cues indicating which hemifield the target stimuli would appear in. The target stimuli consisted of either small or large bars which participants identified and responded with \u2018s\u2019 for small and \u2018l\u2019 for large. Results showed that there was stronger alpha frequency suppression in brain areas contralateral to the targeted hemifield. This is due to visual stimuli being processed contralaterally. 200ms before the stimuli was presented, in active processing areas like the parietal lobe (P3), the alpha range is also lower. This study is supportive of AIM (Klimesch et al, 2007), and is used as the basis for this experiment, as it is a partial replication. In this experiment, the focus will be on the effect of arrow cues, specifically the direction they are facing.<nl><nl>Hypothesis<nl>As AIH states, alpha range activity is present in areas that are uninvolved in active processing and is suppressed in areas that actively process. By directing attention, and cueing the participant to expect the stimuli in a specific region they will begin paying attention. As shown by Sauseng et al (2005), visual stimuli is processed contralaterally resulting in alpha suppression in the other side of the brain. For example, if the stimuli is present in the left visual field it will be processed by the right hemisphere. By using the left parietal cortex (P3) to record alpha activity, it is expected that alpha activity will be greater when a stimulus is shown on the left and for this activity to be suppressed when the stimuli is on the right.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 undergraduate students were participants chosen from an opportunity sample.<nl><nl>Design<nl>This experiment uses a within subjects design. The dependent variable is the alpha range amplitudes (microvolts) on the left hand side of the parietal lobe (P3). The independent variable is the direction of the arrow cue, with two levels, left or right. <nl>Materials<nl>This experiment used a Biopac MP36 to collect data, EEG electrodes, AC Cream, Abrasive paste, PsychoPy to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device and stimuli (see figure 1). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG by opening the Biopac student lab. From the \u2018analog\u2019 tab select Electroencaphagram (EEG)\u2019 \u20180.5-100Hz wnotch\u2019, so the 50Hz band is filtered out. Digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker.. The \u2018calculation\u2019 tab allowed alpha frequency to be recorded. Then select \u2018EEG alpha 8-13Hz\u2019 from the drop down list. The sampling rate was 1000Hz. The participant was then prepared to be attached to the EEG. The electrode sites were abraded with everi cream using a cotton bud, and then AC cream was put on the electrodes. The electrodes are placed using the 1020 system. The active electrode was placed on P3. Participants were then given a cued visual task. A fixation cross was cued at the centre of the screen for 34ms, followed by an arrow indicating where to focus attention, with a 50% chance of it being cued left or right. There was then an interval of 600-800ms followed by a fixation cross for the second time, finally the participant was shown the target stimuli for 50ms, either a large or small white bar against a black background. Participants were then asked to use the keyboard to respond to the stimuli, typing either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. 75% of the trials were valid (the target stimuli was presented in the same hemifield that the arrow cue indicated), and 25% were invalid (the target stimuli was presented in the other hemifield). There were 20 blocks of the four trial types (cue left with a small bar, cue right with a small bar, cue left with a large bar and cue right with a large bar) so in total there were 80 trials.<nl><nl>Results<nl>There were transformations applied to the raw 9-13Hz alpha EEG data. There were eventmarkers received by PsychoPy through the Stimtracker, in order to identify when the stimuli was presented to the participants. The data also was used to specifically analyse from 200ms prior to stimulus onset after the directional arrow cues had been shown. Furthermore, the data was rectified, making negative values positive despite them showing excitatory or inhibitory activity. The samples were also averaged in order to limit the impact that outlying values would have on the data. This data is referred to as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl><nl>Descriptive Statistics<nl><table><nl><nl>Inferential Statistics <nl>The wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T=566, n=38, p=.002).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results of this experiment show that there was a significantly higher level of alpha activity when the stimulus was shown on the left hand side, this fit the original hypothesis. These results are consistent with AIH (Klimesch et al, 2007) as it shows that when participants are given a stimulus in their left hemifield, due to contralateral processing, this is processed by the right part of brain areas. As we were looking at P3, the left side of the parietal lobe, when shown a cue on the left it was processed on the right, meaning the left was task irrelevant and inattentive, resulting in higher alpha activity.<nl><nl>Methodological Problems<nl>Factors which may have confounded data include artefacts, which is when the EEG is contaminated by excess movement. When eye movements take place, the electrical activity could be recorded as brain activity. Eye movements could be blinking or horizontal eye movement, especially when having to look at either side of the screen. Blinking could also pose other issues such as the participant missing the cue. However, it does not seem to be too much of an issue and repetition and more trials would minimise the effects of this.<nl>Another issue could be the laboratory setting, as this could have an affect on brain activity. This is not a very normal situation for participants to be placed in so they may be uncomfortable or more alert as they know they are being studied. This could impact the EEG recordings as it is not a life-like situation so the results may not be generalisable to the whole population.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Overall, the data is valid despite minor methodological issues, which after replication can minimise the effect of individual differences, such as blinking and horizontal eye movement. The data also supports AIH and produced the expected results.", "Hi <addr3_SN>!<nl><nl>Happy new year! I hope you are well!<nl>A quick question regarding the dissertation.

But like, other than that, like, it\u2019s like when you go out to eat Mexican food, I feel like that\u2019s the best thing to go out to eat, just 'cause like the music\u2019s always good in the restaurant or like the atmosphere\u2019s always nice and like everyone\u2019s just enjoying themselves. But like, it\u2019s not too, too formal and it\u2019s quite, it\u2019s quite like you can, there\u2019s like a lot of hand food, it\u2019s like quite chilled out food. And then it\u2019s also good 'cause like you get loads of like kits and stuff so you can make it up and like it\u2019s not, and it doesn\u2019t taste bad, like every one\u2019s tasted good, I\u2019ve never. It\u2019s like pizza, like it will always taste good.<new>Erm, my favourite dish to cook is probably, erm, it\u2019s this Indian dish called, it, aloo  <unintelligible>  like it has, it\u2019s, er, potatoes and cauliflower and I, like every time we have to make at home, or like we want to make it like my, like mum always asks me to make it and like I feel like it  <unintelligible>  a lot that she wants me to make it because like she\u2019s been cooking Indian food like since she was like fifteen. So, for her to want me to make it must mean that like I make it really well. So, then I always, like, whenever she asks me to make it, I always make it quite happily because I\u2019m like, yeah, like it must be good. And I always get compliments on it. So, that what  <laugh>  drives me to make it.<new>Yeah. So, erm, first, you put the oil in the pan and like heat it up a bit. And then you put your, like you can slice your onions however you want them, like I normally like leaving them long but like some people like dicing them and stuff. Then, erm, that goes into the like hot oil and then you like, you normally brown them off, like it depends on how everybody likes to have your onions cooked, I guess. And then, erm, after that, I normally put in like ginger or garlic. Like you can have it fresh but like just out of ease, like you can buy these garlic and ginger cubes from like  <supermarket1> \u2019s and stuff and they\u2019re frozen and then you just chuck them in. And I find that way easier than just like spending time with like peeling garlic and ginger and like do all that stuff. So then, erm, yeah, I use the cubes. And then after that, I\u2019ll use chopped chillies, like normally, we have them like chopped already so then like you don\u2019t have to chop them at a reasonable time. And yeah, I put that in. And that\u2019s like a teaspoon of that. And then, erm, after that, I let that like cook for a little bit just so it\u2019s like done. And then I\u2019ll put in, erm, I put teaspoon of salt, a teaspoon of garam masala, a teaspoon of turmeric and then a teaspoon of paprika and let, then like just to taste, like if I feel like it\u2019s not going to be spicy enough, I\u2019ll put a bit of like red, like red chilli powder in, just to make it a bit more spicy. And then after that, erm, they normally like start sticking to the bottom of the pan so then I try and put some water in to keep it like\u2026 just stop it from burning. And then, erm, after that I\u2019ll put in some chopped tomatoes out of like a can and then that just makes sure it doesn\u2019t burn in it. I cook that for like normally like five minutes. And then after that, I\u2019ll put in some potatoes that I\u2019ve like peeled before and then I cook those until they\u2019re cooked about halfway. And those are like in a like a square shape, like I cut them in squares but like it just depends on how you want it. But yeah, erm, put that in. Then I cook them up until they\u2019re cooked about halfway, then I\u2019ll put in the cauliflower  <unintelligible> . The cauliflower is just cut into however big the pieces like we want to have, I guess. And then I just leave that to cook and then just stir it every so often so it doesn\u2019t stick to the bottom and burn.

She has quite a surprised, but in a positive way, erm, her facial feature shows that she is looking at something which is surprising. And the other lady, on the right of her, is looking downwards towards something. Erm, also the lady with the black and white stripey top has medium length hair, is quite fair skinned, has dark brown hair going into more of an ombr\u00e9 blonde. Whereas the other lady sat down is, she is a Black lady, with black twists. Also, by the picture, it looks like the lady in the black and white top is showing er, her friend next to her, they look like they know each other. And yeah, they look like they\u2019re friends. They look like they are s- in some sort of maybe school environment. It\u2019s a casual environment, which is seen by the clothes that they are wearing. Another way this picture can also be seen is the lady in the denim jacket is looking, n-not looking at something that the girl in the black and white top is showing her, she\u2019s actually looking at something else, and that she\u2019s surprised by what she\u2019s seen because her mouth is wide open. In the second picture, it looks like erm, there are two boys in this picture. One is of South Asian descent, has short black hair and is wearing a black and red chequered shirt with a white top underneath, and there\u2019s a boy next to him on the, his left.

Whereas his friend next to him is either staring at him, or there is something that\u2019s distracted him that\u2019s next to the guy in the black and red sweatshirt. From the looks of it, because of how close they are, they look like friends. And they look like university students, or a little bit older. They, yeah, they look around the age of between eighteen to er twenty-two. Yeah. In the background actually there are light green and dark green spots, with a black background, which looks like either a wallpaper or it looks like they\u2019re sitting down on a sofa which has that background. And the table that the MacBook is on is a wooden table with different shades of brown, giving it that timber sort of effect. Yeah. In the third picture, there is a Black female and on her left is a South Asian male. South Asian male has a beard and almost a buzz cut which has grown out. And he is wearing a dark green shirt with a long black coat that has buttons on the side, and also a long collar with beige trousers, dark beige trousers, and he is wearing black trainers. In the background of these two people there is a sort of spiral, almost hypnotising effect, sort of wallpaper. Which is, consists of many small, round, white circles across a black backdrop. The girl is wearing a black top with a black leather jacket, and is holding something in her hand, which I can\u2019t see it. Oh, she\u2019s holding something and it looks like there is also a hand in the picture, next to both of her hands. She\u2019s also wearing dark maroon leggings, with light brown leather boots. There is a table in front of them which has something on the glass table, which consists of either leaflets or pamphlets. And yeah, the male is also holding a book which he\u2019s gone through about, I\u2019d say, fifty per cent of. He looks like he\u2019s in the middle of the book; he looks like he\u2019s about to turn a page. They both are staring at the same thing, it looks like, because their eyes are in the same direction. They are both smiling. Erm, you can tell they\u2019re both quite comfortable with each other because of how close they are sat to each other. It looks like they are almost friends. It also looks like they may be students as well, because that looks like quite a big book. So yeah, number three has, you can tell they\u2019re both looking at something which makes them happy, or is something that is amusing to them. Because neither of them look confused. I-I think they both look eager to know more.", " Okay. So, usually, I would be working so in that case, I would probably wake up, do my normal exercise and then eat but I would eat breakfast at around ten to eleven. So, that would either be pancakes or mostly beans on toast, eggs on toast, anything with my beans, I don\u2019t usually eat normal beans, I like spicy beans, which is a bit weird. But yeah, anything like that. If there\u2019s any, if it\u2019s around lunchtime, it would probably be something frozen so like frozen pizza or like frozen burgers. In my household, we\u2019re not allowed any meat so we\u2019re completely vegetarian in this house. So, that would, so it would probably be like a margherita pizza or, you know, you have those like readymade noodles, could be those. But yeah, lunch would probably be a quick meal. Dinner is probably where we like eat the most. So, dinner for me, so I\u2019m on, I\u2019m  <continental_adj>  so it would typically be Asia-, it would be  <country1_adj>  food or sometimes, it, anything we eat would probably be vegetable orientated. So, it would either be, if it\u2019s Mexican, we\u2019ll have like loads of vegetables in a wrap, we have veg, veggie pasta. We eat dinner at around six to seven and then if any of us are hungry after, there\u2019s always like chocolate or snacks or food that we can eat after but usually, we\u2019re all full by dinner anyways. So yeah, that would be my typical meal. I don\u2019t usually snack in this house but if I\u2019m working then it\u2019s completely different. If I\u2019m working then I\u2019m going to be eating dinner. I mean, I\u2019m going to be eating lunch at work but my lunch will be dinner from the day before.

And that if I, the rest of the day I can go without eating until dinner. For example, today, I just had like two mozzarella and pesto sandwiches. I\u2019m probably not going to be eating until like six or seven p.m. So, that\u2019s, yeah, I would say that\u2019s the most important meal, just \u2018cause you have energy. Otherwise, if you\u2019re waiting for dinner, by then my stomach aches and then you know when you go, you\u2019re in bed and you, you\u2019re just tired because you haven\u2019t eaten?

{"id": "3847e060-6f91-4b4f-b3f3-05a73a01dc1407770", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>What is religion? Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961). This definition further criticizes religion as something which individuals turn to out of worry and desperation.<nl>In addition to the functional definitions of religion which can be seen above, there is also the substantive definition of religion which can be investigated. Substantive definitions tend to define religion in terms of its content rather than its function. Here, it is common for the existence of a \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018supernatural being\u2019 to be present when defining religion. This can be seen in Roland Robertsons definition of religion, where he states that \u2018religion refers to the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life\u2019 (Robertson, 1970). Such definitions however, can be seen as problematic to the wider community. This definition of religion by Robertson, clearly necessitates the existence of a god, and rejects any ideas that do not have a \u2018god\u2019 at the centre of their ideology to be classed as religion. This would not allow for beliefs such as Buddhism to be categorised as a religion, due to the fact that it is not based upon the concept of a creator- God (Gethin, 1998). Robertson\u2019s view on religion is supported by Max Weber, who also uses a substantive concept of religion, seeing it as a belief in a divine entity which cannot be explained scientifically (Weber, 2009). In other words, the belief in a god is required for a concept to be deemed as a religion. Ronald Dworkin however, opposes this notion and states that \u2018religion, does not necessarily mean a belief in god\u2019 and \u2018religion is an interpretive concept\u2019 (Dworkin, 2013). Dworkins use of the word \u2018interpretive\u2019, infers that religion can have a different meaning, dependent on the individual. Buddhism has now been linked to the global category of a world religion (McMahan, 2012), causing much debate upon what constitutes religion. This begs the question, who has set the requirements for what can and cannot be defined as a religion? Who has the right to dictate this? As Aldridge states \u2018Defining religion involves an exercise of power\u2019 (Aldridge, 2007).<nl><nl>Religion in International Relations- Post Secularization and Foreign Policy <nl>Often, when analysing religion within the international relations scene it can be deemed an aspect which is hastily overlooked. Religion is rarely included in most major theories of international relations and this can be ascribed to major Western social thinkers rejecting the notion of religion (Fox and Sandler, 2004), as discussed previously. As a particular scholar illustrated , \u2018the role of religion in explaining attitudes toward issues of international relations is somewhat limited\u2019 (Jelen, 1994). However, when further analysing international relations and conflict, it is clear that religion can be seen as a crucial element which should not be disregarded. It has been said that \u2018Domestic conflicts, including religious conflicts are becoming increasingly international issues\u2019 (Fox and Sandler, 2004). This extract from \u2018Bringing religion into International Relations\u2019, further emphasis the vital role that religion can play when assessing international relations. Examples of conflict which involve religion are The Israel Palestine conflict and the Thirty Years war. Here, religion can be key in resolving and understanding the clash, possibly presenting a recourse. <nl>Post secularization, it has been noted that a global resurgence of religion is transforming our understanding of international relations (Thomas, 2005). As there has been an increase in religious actors, it has recently become a vital analytical focus (Haynes,2005). These religious actors can include examples such as foreign policy taking into account religion, as well as transnational factors. The more that religion begins to play a pivotal role in making country decisions, the more clarity there is on what a substantial role religion plays on the international scene. There has previously been a narrative which has pushed the notion that the term \u2018religion\u2019 carries negative connotations and only leads to tension and ferocity, bringing nothing of substance to the international relations division. This adheres to the \u2018Westphalian presumption\u2019, which holds that \u2018religious and cultural pluralism cannot be accommodated in international public life\u2019 (Thomas, 2005). In other words, faith must be conceived as an internal matter to the sovereign state in order to avoid the risk of potential religious wars. This has encouraged using scientific knowledge and clear reasoning as justification for decisions over religion. It is clear that during these strongly secular times, there wasn\u2019t a want to define the term \u2018religion\u2019 from an international perspective. However, as religion began to make a return to the international scene, events such as 911 and Samuel Huntingtons\u2019 famous \u2018The clash of civilizations?\u2019 thesis (Huntington, 2000), only drew more attention to the importance of religion on the international relations front. As there was deemed to be a rise in religious clash and issues, with pivotal events such as 911, the topic of religion had to be assessed on the international scale. <nl>Many would also agree that religion has an important role to play in creating and shaping beliefs, which may in turn influence the formulation of state policy and foreign policy considerations. An instance of this can be seen with President George W. Bush, where he referred to the US having a \u2018calling\u2019 and \u2018mission\u2019 by the \u2018Maker of heaven\u2019 in his speeches on Foreign Policy (Judis, 2005). Not only can it be inferred here that George Bush is attempting to appeal to his majority audience with his \u2018faithful\u2019 language, but his references to God here explain how religion has had a direct impact on the foreign policy choices made. Bush\u2019s choice of language and rhetoric is extremely influential in shaping perspectives of the US citizens opinions on foreign policy. It was found here that there was a clear link between religion and opinion on U.S foreign policy in the Middle East (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). In particular, Evangelical Christians are more supportive of Bush\u2019s Foreign policy on the Iraq war and his foreign policy in general (Pew Research Centre, 2020). In a specific study carried out by Pew Research Centre, even after adjusting for the identity of the respondents groups, the impact of Evangelical beliefs towards foreign policy towards the Middle East remained statistically important (Pew Research Centre, 2020). These results are significant as they provide confirmatory proof that the position of Evangelical affiliation in shaping public opinion on foreign policy is important. It is also fundamental in understanding what a large effect a single religious group can have on how a country is run. The Middle East and President George Bush are a great area of focus due to the Iraq war being a matter which has concerned wide-spread public opinion since 2003 (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). As Boyer stated \u2018For many believers in biblical prophecy, the Bush administration\u2019s go-it-alone foreign policy, hands-off attitude toward the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and proposed war on Iraq, are not simply actions in the national self-interest or an extension of the war on terrorism, but part of an unfolding divine plan\u2019 (Boyer, 2003). This quote highlights how it is recognised that many individuals feel as though these conflicts directly involve religion and god, not only country policy. This infers that individuals will use faith as a major indicator when deciding their stance on subjects such as the Iraq war and foreign policy. On the contrary, research from the Pew Research centre suggests that people feel as though their faith does not define their opinion on the Iraq War (Different Faiths, Different Messages, 2020). Either way, the fact that there is much debate around religion probes several questions on the topic of faith, making it a valid matter when discussing international relations. As religion is increasingly being used for justification as well as indication, it is an important matter to consider on the international scene. \u00a8<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, when looking at definitions of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the context of both Sociology and International relations, it is obvious that there is much debate around what the word entails and its specific effects on society, good or bad. It is clear however, that religion has played a large role in shaping and moulding the current societies that we live in today, as well as the international relations scene, be it secular or not. Although there may be much debate upon whether the consequences of religion are \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 and \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019, the simple fact that decisions have and are being made based upon this, make it a crucial element that must be taken into consideration when looking at both society and international relations. There is no doubt that further research in the field of religion is vital and needed in order for a wider understanding of religion and its impact in both contexts.", "Oh. Probably a lot. Erm, I do think about money when I go shopping, well, food shopping. Erm, I\u2019m not sure if it would positive or negative because if I was to eat whatever I want, like, if, not thinking about money, it would probably be not good food.

Erm, I guess if you\u2019re eating better quality food it\u2019ll all be organic and, erm, yeah, if food, if I had all the, if I had all this money, I\u2019d also be intelligent and not want to make myself ill through eating  <unintelligible>   <laugh>  so yeah.<new>I just mean, erm, I\u2019m just a massive, like I have a huge sweet-tooth.

But that is because I\u2019m a bit crazy and I\u2019m a very extreme person. So, if I had it in my room, I\u2019d have to eat it all, without fail.

Actually no, I\u2019m going to say I eat less because normally, if I\u2019m, I\u2019m quite like an outgoing, active person, erm, always out with friends doing something. And that does tend to revolve around food, you know, you go for a drink where you\u2019re probably eating or you go out for lunch or dinner, etcetera. So, because I can\u2019t do that, I\u2019ve eaten, I\u2019m eating less. Erm, then I guess at home, just a bit more conscious, erm, trying not to fill time with food, you know, like stay working or whatever it is. So, I would say I\u2019m eating a bit less and I think \u2018cause of, because of corona sort of an excuse to try to save money. So, I probably, I don\u2019t really order takeout much so I\u2019m cooking myself a lot more, which is good. Erm, yeah, and then, yeah.<new>I\u2019m not going to lie, tr-, I think my favourite drink is water. Erm, I try to avoid like fizzy drinks where possible, er, just because of like, I would just like keep my skin as good as it can be. If I start drinking too much like fizzy drinks and stuff, my skin goes horrible. Erm, but if I was to pick like my favourite fizzy drink would probably be like Dr Pepper."]}

Due to contralateral processing, P3 should remain inattentive when shown a stimuli on the left. By using EEG, alpha activity can be recorded when shown a stimuli cued left or cued right. Event markers allow for it to be clear when the participant is shown the stimuli, and the alpha activity was recorded. The results showed that there was a significantly higher in left than right cue condition, and supported the hypothesis.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha activity refers to electrical impulses oscillating at 8-13Hz , this is an alpha wave. These brain waves begin in the cerebral cortex (Moini &amp; Piran, 2020) and occur during periods of inattention, where one is in a restful state, whilst being awake, examples of this is when closing eyes, meditating (Lagopoulos et al., 2009), daydreaming etc.  When the brain begins to focus on stimuli, alpha waves are suppressed. The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007), proposes that high alpha indicates disengagement and inhibition of task irrelevant brain areas. In task relevant brain areas, alpha remains low, supporting that alpha activity is modulated by attention.  <nl><nl>This hypothesis is supported by Magosso et al, 2019, which used a regular setting and a VR (virtual reality) setting to see if the intensity of the task and the levels of attention required affects alpha frequency. The results showed that alpha signals are suppressed when having to give attention to tasks although it seems that when isolated from all external features (when participating in VR) alpha activity becomes greater. This suggests that it is the modulation and diversion of attention which causes changes in alpha frequencies.<nl><nl>Sauseng et al (2005) presented participants with directional cues indicating which hemifield the target stimuli would appear in. The target stimuli consisted of either small or large bars which participants identified and responded with \u2018s\u2019 for small and \u2018l\u2019 for large. Results showed that there was stronger alpha frequency suppression in brain areas contralateral to the targeted hemifield. This is due to visual stimuli being processed contralaterally. 200ms before the stimuli was presented, in active processing areas like the parietal lobe (P3), the alpha range is also lower. This study is supportive of AIM (Klimesch et al, 2007), and is used as the basis for this experiment, as it is a partial replication. In this experiment, the focus will be on the effect of arrow cues, specifically the direction they are facing.<nl><nl>Hypothesis<nl>As AIH states, alpha range activity is present in areas that are uninvolved in active processing and is suppressed in areas that actively process. By directing attention, and cueing the participant to expect the stimuli in a specific region they will begin paying attention. As shown by Sauseng et al (2005), visual stimuli is processed contralaterally resulting in alpha suppression in the other side of the brain. For example, if the stimuli is present in the left visual field it will be processed by the right hemisphere. By using the left parietal cortex (P3) to record alpha activity, it is expected that alpha activity will be greater when a stimulus is shown on the left and for this activity to be suppressed when the stimuli is on the right.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 undergraduate students were participants chosen from an opportunity sample.<nl><nl>Design<nl>This experiment uses a within subjects design. The dependent variable is the alpha range amplitudes (microvolts) on the left hand side of the parietal lobe (P3). The independent variable is the direction of the arrow cue, with two levels, left or right. <nl>Materials<nl>This experiment used a Biopac MP36 to collect data, EEG electrodes, AC Cream, Abrasive paste, PsychoPy to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device and stimuli (see figure 1). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG by opening the Biopac student lab. From the \u2018analog\u2019 tab select Electroencaphagram (EEG)\u2019 \u20180.5-100Hz wnotch\u2019, so the 50Hz band is filtered out. Digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker.. The \u2018calculation\u2019 tab allowed alpha frequency to be recorded. Then select \u2018EEG alpha 8-13Hz\u2019 from the drop down list. The sampling rate was 1000Hz. The participant was then prepared to be attached to the EEG. The electrode sites were abraded with everi cream using a cotton bud, and then AC cream was put on the electrodes. The electrodes are placed using the 1020 system. The active electrode was placed on P3. Participants were then given a cued visual task. A fixation cross was cued at the centre of the screen for 34ms, followed by an arrow indicating where to focus attention, with a 50% chance of it being cued left or right. There was then an interval of 600-800ms followed by a fixation cross for the second time, finally the participant was shown the target stimuli for 50ms, either a large or small white bar against a black background. Participants were then asked to use the keyboard to respond to the stimuli, typing either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. 75% of the trials were valid (the target stimuli was presented in the same hemifield that the arrow cue indicated), and 25% were invalid (the target stimuli was presented in the other hemifield). There were 20 blocks of the four trial types (cue left with a small bar, cue right with a small bar, cue left with a large bar and cue right with a large bar) so in total there were 80 trials.<nl><nl>Results<nl>There were transformations applied to the raw 9-13Hz alpha EEG data. There were eventmarkers received by PsychoPy through the Stimtracker, in order to identify when the stimuli was presented to the participants. The data also was used to specifically analyse from 200ms prior to stimulus onset after the directional arrow cues had been shown. Furthermore, the data was rectified, making negative values positive despite them showing excitatory or inhibitory activity. The samples were also averaged in order to limit the impact that outlying values would have on the data. This data is referred to as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl><nl>Descriptive Statistics<nl><table><nl><nl>Inferential Statistics <nl>The wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T=566, n=38, p=.002).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results of this experiment show that there was a significantly higher level of alpha activity when the stimulus was shown on the left hand side, this fit the original hypothesis. These results are consistent with AIH (Klimesch et al, 2007) as it shows that when participants are given a stimulus in their left hemifield, due to contralateral processing, this is processed by the right part of brain areas. As we were looking at P3, the left side of the parietal lobe, when shown a cue on the left it was processed on the right, meaning the left was task irrelevant and inattentive, resulting in higher alpha activity.<nl><nl>Methodological Problems<nl>Factors which may have confounded data include artefacts, which is when the EEG is contaminated by excess movement. When eye movements take place, the electrical activity could be recorded as brain activity. Eye movements could be blinking or horizontal eye movement, especially when having to look at either side of the screen. Blinking could also pose other issues such as the participant missing the cue. However, it does not seem to be too much of an issue and repetition and more trials would minimise the effects of this.<nl>Another issue could be the laboratory setting, as this could have an affect on brain activity. This is not a very normal situation for participants to be placed in so they may be uncomfortable or more alert as they know they are being studied. This could impact the EEG recordings as it is not a life-like situation so the results may not be generalisable to the whole population.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Overall, the data is valid despite minor methodological issues, which after replication can minimise the effect of individual differences, such as blinking and horizontal eye movement. The data also supports AIH and produced the expected results.", "Erm, I really like Mexican food just because like I feel like when you like go out to eat, as well, like especially when you go out to eat Mexican feed, I feel like it\u2019s just such a nice like, it\u2019s like a nice atmosphere, the food\u2019s really good, like it\u2019s nice and warm and it\u2019s quite like fulfilling, like you always feel full after eating Mexican food, like, especially me, like I feel like when I\u2019ve eaten, like, a like a burrito or like fajitas or whatever, I\u2019m always like really full.

One is sat down wearing a denim jacket, and she has twists in her hair. The other woman is wearing a black and white stripey top, dark blue jeans and a belt. So number one consists of the lady in the denim jacket sitting down, she\u2019s staring at something and her mouth is wide open. She has quite a surprised, but in a positive way, erm, her facial feature shows that she is looking at something which is surprising. And the other lady, on the right of her, is looking downwards towards something. Erm, also the lady with the black and white stripey top has medium length hair, is quite fair skinned, has dark brown hair going into more of an ombr\u00e9 blonde. Whereas the other lady sat down is, she is a Black lady, with black twists. Also, by the picture, it looks like the lady in the black and white top is showing er, her friend next to her, they look like they know each other. And yeah, they look like they\u2019re friends. They look like they are s- in some sort of maybe school environment. It\u2019s a casual environment, which is seen by the clothes that they are wearing. Another way this picture can also be seen is the lady in the denim jacket is looking, n-not looking at something that the girl in the black and white top is showing her, she\u2019s actually looking at something else, and that she\u2019s surprised by what she\u2019s seen because her mouth is wide open. In the second picture, it looks like erm, there are two boys in this picture. One is of South Asian descent, has short black hair and is wearing a black and red chequered shirt with a white top underneath, and there\u2019s a boy next to him on the, his left. And he\u2019s quite fair skinned, has a black ear piercing, and has short brown hair. He\u2019s wearing a top which consists of black and white flowers with red writing on top, but you can\u2019t read the writing. And the guy in the black and red sweatshirt is staring at a MacBook Air, and, er, looks really interested in what he is reading. Whereas his friend next to him is either staring at him, or there is something that\u2019s distracted him that\u2019s next to the guy in the black and red sweatshirt. From the looks of it, because of how close they are, they look like friends. And they look like university students, or a little bit older. They, yeah, they look around the age of between eighteen to er twenty-two. Yeah. In the background actually there are light green and dark green spots, with a black background, which looks like either a wallpaper or it looks like they\u2019re sitting down on a sofa which has that background. And the table that the MacBook is on is a wooden table with different shades of brown, giving it that timber sort of effect. Yeah. In the third picture, there is a Black female and on her left is a South Asian male. South Asian male has a beard and almost a buzz cut which has grown out. And he is wearing a dark green shirt with a long black coat that has buttons on the side, and also a long collar with beige trousers, dark beige trousers, and he is wearing black trainers. In the background of these two people there is a sort of spiral, almost hypnotising effect, sort of wallpaper. Which is, consists of many small, round, white circles across a black backdrop. The girl is wearing a black top with a black leather jacket, and is holding something in her hand, which I can\u2019t see it. Oh, she\u2019s holding something and it looks like there is also a hand in the picture, next to both of her hands. She\u2019s also wearing dark maroon leggings, with light brown leather boots. There is a table in front of them which has something on the glass table, which consists of either leaflets or pamphlets. And yeah, the male is also holding a book which he\u2019s gone through about, I\u2019d say, fifty per cent of. He looks like he\u2019s in the middle of the book; he looks like he\u2019s about to turn a page. They both are staring at the same thing, it looks like, because their eyes are in the same direction. They are both smiling. Erm, you can tell they\u2019re both quite comfortable with each other because of how close they are sat to each other. It looks like they are almost friends. It also looks like they may be students as well, because that looks like quite a big book. So yeah, number three has, you can tell they\u2019re both looking at something which makes them happy, or is something that is amusing to them. Because neither of them look confused. I-I think they both look eager to know more."]}

So, because I can\u2019t do that, I\u2019ve eaten, I\u2019m eating less.

So, I would say I\u2019m eating a bit less and I think \u2018cause of, because of corona sort of an excuse to try to save money.

{"id": "1c71ab5b-f65b-43a6-a07f-c62eb7b5efd9", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Abstract<nl>Alpha activity is higher in periods of inattentiveness, and is suppressed when completing tasks. Due to contralateral processing, P3 should remain inattentive when shown a stimuli on the left. By using EEG, alpha activity can be recorded when shown a stimuli cued left or cued right. Event markers allow for it to be clear when the participant is shown the stimuli, and the alpha activity was recorded. The results showed that there was a significantly higher in left than right cue condition, and supported the hypothesis.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha activity refers to electrical impulses oscillating at 8-13Hz , this is an alpha wave. These brain waves begin in the cerebral cortex (Moini &amp; Piran, 2020) and occur during periods of inattention, where one is in a restful state, whilst being awake, examples of this is when closing eyes, meditating (Lagopoulos et al., 2009), daydreaming etc.  When the brain begins to focus on stimuli, alpha waves are suppressed. The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007), proposes that high alpha indicates disengagement and inhibition of task irrelevant brain areas. In task relevant brain areas, alpha remains low, supporting that alpha activity is modulated by attention.  <nl><nl>This hypothesis is supported by Magosso et al, 2019, which used a regular setting and a VR (virtual reality) setting to see if the intensity of the task and the levels of attention required affects alpha frequency. The results showed that alpha signals are suppressed when having to give attention to tasks although it seems that when isolated from all external features (when participating in VR) alpha activity becomes greater. This suggests that it is the modulation and diversion of attention which causes changes in alpha frequencies.<nl><nl>Sauseng et al (2005) presented participants with directional cues indicating which hemifield the target stimuli would appear in. The target stimuli consisted of either small or large bars which participants identified and responded with \u2018s\u2019 for small and \u2018l\u2019 for large. Results showed that there was stronger alpha frequency suppression in brain areas contralateral to the targeted hemifield. This is due to visual stimuli being processed contralaterally. 200ms before the stimuli was presented, in active processing areas like the parietal lobe (P3), the alpha range is also lower. This study is supportive of AIM (Klimesch et al, 2007), and is used as the basis for this experiment, as it is a partial replication. In this experiment, the focus will be on the effect of arrow cues, specifically the direction they are facing.<nl><nl>Hypothesis<nl>As AIH states, alpha range activity is present in areas that are uninvolved in active processing and is suppressed in areas that actively process. By directing attention, and cueing the participant to expect the stimuli in a specific region they will begin paying attention. As shown by Sauseng et al (2005), visual stimuli is processed contralaterally resulting in alpha suppression in the other side of the brain. For example, if the stimuli is present in the left visual field it will be processed by the right hemisphere. By using the left parietal cortex (P3) to record alpha activity, it is expected that alpha activity will be greater when a stimulus is shown on the left and for this activity to be suppressed when the stimuli is on the right.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 undergraduate students were participants chosen from an opportunity sample.<nl><nl>Design<nl>This experiment uses a within subjects design. The dependent variable is the alpha range amplitudes (microvolts) on the left hand side of the parietal lobe (P3). The independent variable is the direction of the arrow cue, with two levels, left or right. <nl>Materials<nl>This experiment used a Biopac MP36 to collect data, EEG electrodes, AC Cream, Abrasive paste, PsychoPy to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device and stimuli (see figure 1). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG by opening the Biopac student lab. From the \u2018analog\u2019 tab select Electroencaphagram (EEG)\u2019 \u20180.5-100Hz wnotch\u2019, so the 50Hz band is filtered out. Digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker.. The \u2018calculation\u2019 tab allowed alpha frequency to be recorded. Then select \u2018EEG alpha 8-13Hz\u2019 from the drop down list. The sampling rate was 1000Hz. The participant was then prepared to be attached to the EEG. The electrode sites were abraded with everi cream using a cotton bud, and then AC cream was put on the electrodes. The electrodes are placed using the 1020 system. The active electrode was placed on P3. Participants were then given a cued visual task. A fixation cross was cued at the centre of the screen for 34ms, followed by an arrow indicating where to focus attention, with a 50% chance of it being cued left or right. There was then an interval of 600-800ms followed by a fixation cross for the second time, finally the participant was shown the target stimuli for 50ms, either a large or small white bar against a black background. Participants were then asked to use the keyboard to respond to the stimuli, typing either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. 75% of the trials were valid (the target stimuli was presented in the same hemifield that the arrow cue indicated), and 25% were invalid (the target stimuli was presented in the other hemifield). There were 20 blocks of the four trial types (cue left with a small bar, cue right with a small bar, cue left with a large bar and cue right with a large bar) so in total there were 80 trials.<nl><nl>Results<nl>There were transformations applied to the raw 9-13Hz alpha EEG data. There were eventmarkers received by PsychoPy through the Stimtracker, in order to identify when the stimuli was presented to the participants. The data also was used to specifically analyse from 200ms prior to stimulus onset after the directional arrow cues had been shown. Furthermore, the data was rectified, making negative values positive despite them showing excitatory or inhibitory activity. The samples were also averaged in order to limit the impact that outlying values would have on the data. This data is referred to as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl><nl>Descriptive Statistics<nl><table><nl><nl>Inferential Statistics <nl>The wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T=566, n=38, p=.002).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results of this experiment show that there was a significantly higher level of alpha activity when the stimulus was shown on the left hand side, this fit the original hypothesis. These results are consistent with AIH (Klimesch et al, 2007) as it shows that when participants are given a stimulus in their left hemifield, due to contralateral processing, this is processed by the right part of brain areas. As we were looking at P3, the left side of the parietal lobe, when shown a cue on the left it was processed on the right, meaning the left was task irrelevant and inattentive, resulting in higher alpha activity.<nl><nl>Methodological Problems<nl>Factors which may have confounded data include artefacts, which is when the EEG is contaminated by excess movement. When eye movements take place, the electrical activity could be recorded as brain activity. Eye movements could be blinking or horizontal eye movement, especially when having to look at either side of the screen. Blinking could also pose other issues such as the participant missing the cue. However, it does not seem to be too much of an issue and repetition and more trials would minimise the effects of this.<nl>Another issue could be the laboratory setting, as this could have an affect on brain activity. This is not a very normal situation for participants to be placed in so they may be uncomfortable or more alert as they know they are being studied. This could impact the EEG recordings as it is not a life-like situation so the results may not be generalisable to the whole population.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Overall, the data is valid despite minor methodological issues, which after replication can minimise the effect of individual differences, such as blinking and horizontal eye movement. The data also supports AIH and produced the expected results.", "To whom this may concern,<nl><nl>My name is <part_FN_SN> and I\u2019m a student on the course of <course>.<nl><nl>Following the results release the link for my results has been removed from my <system>.<nl>I was trying to access it to see the next steps I need to take as it has information of deferred modules and referred modules.<nl><nl>Could you please re instate the link on my <system> or assist with me the deffered examination dates and other such information.<nl><nl>Hope to hear from you soon.<nl><nl>Kind regards,<nl><nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hi <addr1_NN>, <nl>There are reading lists that are given to you for each module - so dependant on what modules you picked and if they are some of the ones I did, I could potentially give you a head start and send you the corresponding reading lists.

She\u2019s also, the teacher\u2019s also rolled their sleeves up, and she\u2019s got a black hairband on her right wrist, and she\u2019s let her blonde hair down. And erm, the student is sitting in the chair with her braids, and she\u2019s smiling quite a bit with her teeth showing as well. And erm, she\u2019s using her right hand to touch her chest, so I think they\u2019re just sharing a moment. So that\u2019s image one.

And erm, yeah, it just looks like they\u2019re students on the same sort of course and, you know, just doing a bit of work together. So that\u2019s image two.

Er, the man\u2019s got a beard and, er, he\u2019s smiling quite a bit, with a green top under his black, er, inspector gadget jacket,  <laugh>  some people would say. Erm, he\u2019s wearing some, er, brown khaki trousers \u2013 no, brown trousers, yeah. And er, the lady\u2019s wearing some brown boots with red leggings, I would say. Erm, you can\u2019t really see it too caref- too well, but er, she\u2019s got some earrings I think, that are dangling. So er, yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it. So yeah, I would say they\u2019re, they\u2019re both students as well, because they\u2019ve got a book. And er, I don\u2019t know who the third character in the picture is as we can\u2019t really see, but we can just see one of his hands. But yeah.

I\u2019ve never, never tried it and I\u2019ve seen loads of people have. So, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve heard about there\u2019s places such as  <unintelligible>  Kitchen or places that do seafood boils? So, I\u2019ve never actually tried crab or I haven\u2019t even tried so many different types of seafood that I haven\u2019t tried. I\u2019ve only tried  <unintelligible>  prawns. I don\u2019t even think I\u2019ve tried shrimp. Yeah, crab and shrimp would probably be the things that I want to try because I\u2019ve seen it looks amazing and every time I see videos sort of online, I\u2019m like how, how haven\u2019t I tried it? But right now, there\u2019s not many places I can go to anyway to try it. But yeah. Or lobster! Lobster! I haven\u2019t tried lobster either, actually. Crab, lobster and shrimp, those, those are the three foods that I have never tried but as soon as lock-lockdown is over, I want,  <restaurant3> , it\u2019s meant to be amazing, in  <city1> . Yeah, I\u2019ve never been and I\u2019ve been saying that I need to go. That\u2019s like the first thing I\u2019m going to be doing and lobster.<new>I have a list, like a list of thirty restaurants on my phone, like I am ready. I have,  genuinely, I\u2019ve looked at their cuisine, I\u2019ve looked at everything, how to get there, how much I\u2019m going to  <unintelligible> . I\u2019ve already started saving but ah, it\u2019s bad. I\u2019m like a foodie to the  <unintelligible> . I think my friend and I are literally planning on starting an Instagram where we go. \u2018Cause we\u2019re obsessed with trying out new places so when the Eat Out to Help Out scheme came, we literally,  <unintelligible> ,  <restaurant4> ,  <restaurant2> , we went to try like all those places and we were like, \"Do you know what, after this is done, we\u2019re just going to start like a social media page up and just start reviewing different places,\" but yeah.<new><laugh><new>I was a vegetarian for seven years before I started eating meat and even then, I can\u2019t eat meat in the house. So, I love it. I think people are not open enough to the idea of it so whenever like I make a new friend and I\u2019m like, \"By the way, we can\u2019t really eat meat in my house,\" they\u2019re always like, \"What?\" And there are so many alternatives that are not spoken about. I wish I could go vegan. I, w-, I genuinely wish I had to the willpower. I think I did try once but there are just not many alternatives that taste the same as cheese. But when it comes to like dairy free chocolate and stuff like, we\u2019re trying. I know my sister\u2019s new year\u2019s resolution is to go vegan for the year. So, I\u2019m the only one my hou-, my dad and I are the only people in the household that eat meat. So, my mum and my sister\u2019s vegetarian. So, it just mean my whole life I have not eaten meat. So, I, I c-, I could go without eating meat in my whole life one hundred percent. It\u2019s just I think in terms of when I was younger, I didn\u2019t like the food that my mum gave me, if that makes sense. Sometimes when you eat too many vegetables, you\u2019re like, it make you ki-, it makes you sick and then you realise you\u2019re not getting the nutrients you need. So, that\u2019s the only reason why I switched to eating meat. But apart from that, I\u2019m a hundred percent vouch  <unintelligible> . I think even at Nando\u2019s now, to this day, I will still get a beanie burger, like I wo-, I won\u2019t get the chicken option just because,  <misc> , I don\u2019t know what that burger tastes like and I would, I don\u2019t even want to eat meat. But then again, when you have like a really nice meat option, I\u2019m bound to choose the meat option. But yeah, I think, I would love to go completely vegetarian. And right now, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen, you know, like Beyond Burger and stuff like, new, new brands that have come up, I\u2019m a big fan of Beyond Burger or Quorn, I eat it all. So, the, the, the, recently, they\u2019ve started, there\u2019s more brands as well, isn\u2019t there? So, recently they\u2019re getting there but, yeah, I completely vouch for it. I think one day... I also think going vegan is extremely expensive like we were looking at, erm, alternatives. So, I don\u2019t drink milk, I only drink soya milk. And although, actually, it\u2019s gotten a lot cheaper, other vegan alternatives are just, they\u2019re so expensive. I think, and it\u2019s, er, living in a house with your parents, I think unle-, until I move out and I can like, I\u2019m the one shopping for myself, I think it\u2019s not worth it. I think right now I\u2019ll stick to like food that we do eat now but yeah, I\u2019m quite happy being a vegetarian, like  <unintelligible> . The, ger-, the weird thing, actually, you know the first lockdown, it was from March until about August, I think and some restaurants and stuff opened. I, my grandparents were around and they\u2019re from India, but I didn\u2019t eat any meat from March to August. And when I went out for the first time, I ate a lot of meat. My body ended up rejecting all of it. So, I felt s-sick and it, I know it was so bad. I had  <unintelligible> , I was throwing up everywhere, I couldn\u2019t move, like I had to crawl down the stairs and like in tears, like  <unintelligible> , just so I could like  <unintelligible>  scream to get my parents\u2019 attention. Yeah, my body rejected it all. So, like after that, my parents were like, \"Okay, small amount of meat and do it slowly.\" And ever since then, I get really scared that if I have  <unintelligible> . That\u2019s why I think right now  <unintelligible>  open, I try and eat meat maybe once a week so my body doesn\u2019t get to what it did last year because yeah, oh, that was awful. I, I, I was going to die, like it was so bad.

Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}

If I\u2019m at home, it would be different but I\u2019m cooking for myself at uni so it\u2019s just literally what\u2019s quick and easy and cheap.", "New liberalism was born after a new wave of liberals in the late 19th century to the early 20th century challenged the positions of classical liberals such as Adam Smith and John Locke. Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}

Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961). This definition further criticizes religion as something which individuals turn to out of worry and desperation.<nl>In addition to the functional definitions of religion which can be seen above, there is also the substantive definition of religion which can be investigated. Substantive definitions tend to define religion in terms of its content rather than its function. Here, it is common for the existence of a \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018supernatural being\u2019 to be present when defining religion. This can be seen in Roland Robertsons definition of religion, where he states that \u2018religion refers to the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life\u2019 (Robertson, 1970). Such definitions however, can be seen as problematic to the wider community. This definition of religion by Robertson, clearly necessitates the existence of a god, and rejects any ideas that do not have a \u2018god\u2019 at the centre of their ideology to be classed as religion. This would not allow for beliefs such as Buddhism to be categorised as a religion, due to the fact that it is not based upon the concept of a creator- God (Gethin, 1998). Robertson\u2019s view on religion is supported by Max Weber, who also uses a substantive concept of religion, seeing it as a belief in a divine entity which cannot be explained scientifically (Weber, 2009). In other words, the belief in a god is required for a concept to be deemed as a religion. Ronald Dworkin however, opposes this notion and states that \u2018religion, does not necessarily mean a belief in god\u2019 and \u2018religion is an interpretive concept\u2019 (Dworkin, 2013). Dworkins use of the word \u2018interpretive\u2019, infers that religion can have a different meaning, dependent on the individual. Buddhism has now been linked to the global category of a world religion (McMahan, 2012), causing much debate upon what constitutes religion. This begs the question, who has set the requirements for what can and cannot be defined as a religion? Who has the right to dictate this? As Aldridge states \u2018Defining religion involves an exercise of power\u2019 (Aldridge, 2007).<nl><nl>Religion in International Relations- Post Secularization and Foreign Policy <nl>Often, when analysing religion within the international relations scene it can be deemed an aspect which is hastily overlooked. Religion is rarely included in most major theories of international relations and this can be ascribed to major Western social thinkers rejecting the notion of religion (Fox and Sandler, 2004), as discussed previously. As a particular scholar illustrated , \u2018the role of religion in explaining attitudes toward issues of international relations is somewhat limited\u2019 (Jelen, 1994). However, when further analysing international relations and conflict, it is clear that religion can be seen as a crucial element which should not be disregarded. It has been said that \u2018Domestic conflicts, including religious conflicts are becoming increasingly international issues\u2019 (Fox and Sandler, 2004). This extract from \u2018Bringing religion into International Relations\u2019, further emphasis the vital role that religion can play when assessing international relations. Examples of conflict which involve religion are The Israel Palestine conflict and the Thirty Years war. Here, religion can be key in resolving and understanding the clash, possibly presenting a recourse. <nl>Post secularization, it has been noted that a global resurgence of religion is transforming our understanding of international relations (Thomas, 2005). As there has been an increase in religious actors, it has recently become a vital analytical focus (Haynes,2005). These religious actors can include examples such as foreign policy taking into account religion, as well as transnational factors. The more that religion begins to play a pivotal role in making country decisions, the more clarity there is on what a substantial role religion plays on the international scene. There has previously been a narrative which has pushed the notion that the term \u2018religion\u2019 carries negative connotations and only leads to tension and ferocity, bringing nothing of substance to the international relations division. This adheres to the \u2018Westphalian presumption\u2019, which holds that \u2018religious and cultural pluralism cannot be accommodated in international public life\u2019 (Thomas, 2005). In other words, faith must be conceived as an internal matter to the sovereign state in order to avoid the risk of potential religious wars. This has encouraged using scientific knowledge and clear reasoning as justification for decisions over religion. It is clear that during these strongly secular times, there wasn\u2019t a want to define the term \u2018religion\u2019 from an international perspective. However, as religion began to make a return to the international scene, events such as 911 and Samuel Huntingtons\u2019 famous \u2018The clash of civilizations?\u2019 thesis (Huntington, 2000), only drew more attention to the importance of religion on the international relations front. As there was deemed to be a rise in religious clash and issues, with pivotal events such as 911, the topic of religion had to be assessed on the international scale. <nl>Many would also agree that religion has an important role to play in creating and shaping beliefs, which may in turn influence the formulation of state policy and foreign policy considerations. An instance of this can be seen with President George W. Bush, where he referred to the US having a \u2018calling\u2019 and \u2018mission\u2019 by the \u2018Maker of heaven\u2019 in his speeches on Foreign Policy (Judis, 2005). Not only can it be inferred here that George Bush is attempting to appeal to his majority audience with his \u2018faithful\u2019 language, but his references to God here explain how religion has had a direct impact on the foreign policy choices made. Bush\u2019s choice of language and rhetoric is extremely influential in shaping perspectives of the US citizens opinions on foreign policy. It was found here that there was a clear link between religion and opinion on U.S foreign policy in the Middle East (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). In particular, Evangelical Christians are more supportive of Bush\u2019s Foreign policy on the Iraq war and his foreign policy in general (Pew Research Centre, 2020). In a specific study carried out by Pew Research Centre, even after adjusting for the identity of the respondents groups, the impact of Evangelical beliefs towards foreign policy towards the Middle East remained statistically important (Pew Research Centre, 2020). These results are significant as they provide confirmatory proof that the position of Evangelical affiliation in shaping public opinion on foreign policy is important. It is also fundamental in understanding what a large effect a single religious group can have on how a country is run. The Middle East and President George Bush are a great area of focus due to the Iraq war being a matter which has concerned wide-spread public opinion since 2003 (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). As Boyer stated \u2018For many believers in biblical prophecy, the Bush administration\u2019s go-it-alone foreign policy, hands-off attitude toward the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and proposed war on Iraq, are not simply actions in the national self-interest or an extension of the war on terrorism, but part of an unfolding divine plan\u2019 (Boyer, 2003). This quote highlights how it is recognised that many individuals feel as though these conflicts directly involve religion and god, not only country policy. This infers that individuals will use faith as a major indicator when deciding their stance on subjects such as the Iraq war and foreign policy. On the contrary, research from the Pew Research centre suggests that people feel as though their faith does not define their opinion on the Iraq War (Different Faiths, Different Messages, 2020). Either way, the fact that there is much debate around religion probes several questions on the topic of faith, making it a valid matter when discussing international relations. As religion is increasingly being used for justification as well as indication, it is an important matter to consider on the international scene. \u00a8<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, when looking at definitions of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the context of both Sociology and International relations, it is obvious that there is much debate around what the word entails and its specific effects on society, good or bad. It is clear however, that religion has played a large role in shaping and moulding the current societies that we live in today, as well as the international relations scene, be it secular or not. Although there may be much debate upon whether the consequences of religion are \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 and \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019, the simple fact that decisions have and are being made based upon this, make it a crucial element that must be taken into consideration when looking at both society and international relations. There is no doubt that further research in the field of religion is vital and needed in order for a wider understanding of religion and its impact in both contexts.", "Hi <addr2_FN>, <nl><nl>Thanks for your response.

{"id": "1d69a220-26bc-41b7-b54b-1b03b748847006791", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl><nl>With the average person in the UK spending 110 minutes on social media, it is inevitable that content displayed across these platforms impact and influence societal norms. The nature of social media aids the ability for societal norms to not only be fueled and accepted across various cultures but also enable this to occur at an accelerated pace. However, the media has been proven to impact self-evaluation in a negative way. For example, there are numerous studies looking at women\u2019s self-evaluation, comparing weight-esteem based on neutral images or ideal images (Brown, Novick, Lord, &amp; Richards, 1992); self-worth based on social comparison (Jones &amp; Buckingham, 2005) etc. Unfortunately, looking at the effects on self-worth in men is minimal. This may be due to the rhetoric that portrays men as emotionless and when any type of emotion is displayed, idioms and phrases like \u2018be a man\u2019 or \u2018stop being a baby\u2019 comes into play. Due to this societal norm, it may make it difficult for men to be able to find appropriate support online and on social media platforms when struggling with the negative impact these sites can have on self worth. It is more acceptable for women to seek help online however, there is less support for men. By researching further into the impacts social media has on men\u2019s self worth, it can enable men to feel more comfortable when facing these issues. The research can aid understanding of this and also result in this topic becoming less taboo, giving a better chance for men to talk freely about their experiences.<nl><nl>I have investigated men\u2019s self worth in the context of social media and my main research question is \u2018How do young men talk about self worth within the context of social media (18-25)?\u2019. My method of analysis is discourse analysis as it allows for in-depth analysis into not only my participant\u2019s language use to construct ideas but also intonation. The interview will take place over a \u2018Zoom\u2019 video call, therefore I am able to have a video recording of all my participants' answers. <nl><nl>AnalysisResults<nl><nl>Through annotating my transcript I was able to select prominent themes that were discussed by my participant in the interview. These themes are spoken of throughout the interview and appear multiple times, even in different questions. From my initial question (line 7) I was able to determine that my participant is an avid user of social media, using it for entertainment purposes as well as using various platforms. This ensures that the questions I ask are relevant to my participant and the answers reflect their social media usage. <nl><nl>Key themes that were discussed by my participant include \"the ideal man\", involving image, appearance and social status; also \"alternate reality\", discussing not only the falseness of social media but also the construction of one's image on social media platforms.<nl><nl>The Ideal Man<nl><nl>The idea of \u2018the ideal man\u2019 featured within my participants answers multiple times, with a construction of what they personally believe to be the ideal man. As opposed to referring to what my participant feels they should look like, my participant instead suggests what others \"should be looking for\" (line 174) in a man, for example, the ideal height \"6 foot 4, or over 6 foot\" (line 175),  the ideal body, having \"six packs\" (line 138), adequate facial hair \"beard\" (line 176) etc. This is a very specific portrayal of men, suggesting that this is a common image for men to hold and strive to achieve. Although men do have an idea of what the ideal body type is they are also aware that in general life, this may not always be the case, with my participant stating that \"It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of me. It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of anyone I know.\" (line 162-163) when asked if he felt represented by men on social media. However, despite this acknowledgement, my participant still felt uncomfortable for comparisons between the appearance of men on social media and himself. My participant used the phrase \"I\u2019d prefer just to leave it at that\" (lines 161 and 294) indicating that men do feel uncomfortable about discussing their appearance, which supports the taboo of men expressing self-doubt and lacking self worth and lowered confidence. This would explain why my participant referred to other people he knows whenever talking about personal appearance, in order to make his answer generalised as opposed to solely him as well as deflect the discomfort about the fact that he is not the ideal man by justifying it with the fact that most people do not look like that. This is supported when he says \"I don\u2019t think many men would want to admit, especially among their peers, wouldn\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re not the ideal person.\" (lines 354-355) <nl><nl>In addition to the body image, a man\u2019s social status and financial status also seems to be prevalent when it comes to describing the \u2018ideal man\u2019 with my participant referring to men with \"seven figures\" (line 138), and men who have \"lavish\" (line 81 ) lifestyles. A given example was the actor and influencer \u2018Dan Bilzerian\u2019; well known for \"constantly flaunting a bunch of money\" (line 241) and \"constantly surrounded by money\". (line 242) This was someone who my participant would refer to as a \u2018role model\u2019 for most males. My participant also referred to the fact that \"men can be successful on social media without looking the greatest\" (line 225), due to their social and financial status. This is supported by the evolutionary psychology theory that women will desire men who are able to provide stability, in the forms of shelter, money, food etc. (Li, Li, Chan &amp; Zhang, 2016). This would explain that now in the digital age, men are able to attract attention with their wealth via social media through posting \"lavish\" (line 81) objects. As it is now commonplace for influencers to be posting this type of content, as my participant stated, \"ordinary people might look at that and think \u2018Well, that\u2019s not me\u2019.\"(line  So this becomes the new goals and the new norm. It is evident that the fact that my participant did not relate to these standards, as when asked if he felt represented by these role models and depictions of men he stated \"No. No. No. No I don\u2019t.\" (line 156) Being unable to relate to the norm often results in incongruence between one's actual self and ideal self which may lower self worth. (Rogers, 1959).<nl><nl>My participant states that they have changed themselves in order to conform with these standards, however wished not to elaborate on how he changed. Instead he referred to people that he knew of, talking about there being  \"a lot of men that will spend a bunch of time at the gym to try and achieve the body that every man wants.\" (lines 347-348) This emphasises that the pressures displayed online and on social media affects men enough for them to wish to change their lifestyle in order to relate to these standards. <nl><nl>Alternate Reality<nl><nl>Throughout my participants answers he refers to the fact that social media is \"not a true depiction\" (line 60) , is a \"very, very fake place\" (lines 104, 71, 63), \"is quite a negative place\" (lines 70, 84) , is \"not real\" (line 107) , is \"very unhealthy\" (line 117), has \"bad sides\" (line 123), is \"the furthest thing from real life\" (lines 147-148) etc. This is common in all the answers, and is said in multiple different ways. My participant referred to social media in very negative ways, and suggested it is a \"toxic\" (line 136) place, despite spending around \"5 hours\" (line 15) per day. This is not an uncommon amount of time on social media, however spending this much time surrounded by something that is perceived as negative by my participant, it is unsurprising that his self confidence is impacted. Also, despite this awareness of the fact that not everything is quite what it seems on social media, the standards are still internalised. This suggests that regardless of the reality or the accuracy of the things that one may be exposed to, they are still accepted by people and becomes the societal norm. My participant also refers to the fact that women are more educated about the ways images are distorted online as opposed to enhancements and photoshop for men.  <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl><nl>From my research, it is evident that despite being aware of the falseness and unrealistic standards of social media, it is evident that young men\u2019s self worth is impacted negatively by the content they are exposed to on social media. Despite being adamant that they are aware of the one sidedness of social media, men continue to make comparisons and draw from this to bring into real life situations. This makes it clear that men experience lowered self confidence not only looks wise but also based on their financial status, social status and more materialistic things. My research has also made it clear that men also feel pressure, and more should be done in terms of support for men online. However, regardless of the gender, social media does tend to display only positive events, making it harder for regular people to accept other events and negative things in real life.", "Erm, I\u2019m going to say, the, I watched a, this video like, it was like a TikTok video or something and it, it was like, erm, this guy makes like, like vegan like chicken and stuff and like it\u2019s made out of like bread, like it\u2019s, he makes this bread, right and like he like washes out the starch and stuff. And it looks so disgusting whilst he\u2019s making it. But like the f-, end product, like it looks amazing and it looks like it tastes really good. And the thing is like, erm, like, I, I\u2019m not, I\u2019m not vegan or I\u2019m not vegetarian or anything but my boyfriend is. So, like, I feel bad whenever I\u2019m like eating like a burger or like something like that near him. Like he doesn\u2019t mind but like at the same time, I feel like, I feel bad so then like I\u2019ve been trying to, you know, like not be vegetarian but trying to eat a bit more like vegetarian. 'Cause not only is it like good for the environment and stuff like, a lot of people around me are vegetarian, so like my parents are vegetarian, like my boyfriend\u2019s vegetarian now, my, like a lot of my friends have become vegetarian as well. So, I feel like it would help. But like, I feel like I like meat a lot so having that would be amazing. And being able to make it I feel like would be, would be cool but like it\u2019s so weird like it just looks, it looks so tasty but at like at the same time, like I don\u2019t know how like I would find it or how I\u2019d make it. So, I think that\u2019s something I really want to try.<new>Oh, that would, yeah, I think, I think I\u2019d eat a bit more... because at the moment, I feel like  <laugh> , especially like as a student like I have to watch like what I\u2019m spending money on and I feel like when I s-, try and save money, I try and save on food more than anything when, because with drink, like, especially when like you\u2019re like, like now stuff\u2019s opening up and stuff and like you want to spend money on drinks and stuff. So, I would prioritise that like before my food so like I will go like, I remember like, I, it doesn\u2019t happen as much now because I\u2019ve been at home quite a lot because of, erm, like just out of ease and\u2026 but like in my first year, I used to eat like noodles all the time and my friends would be like, \"Yeah, we\u2019re eating this, like we\u2019ve prepped these meals,\" and I\u2019d be like, \"Yeah, no, that\u2019s not happening.\" But I feel like I\u2019d be able to, I\u2019d eat out a lot more than I do now and I feel like... I don\u2019t feel like my, like my taste would change as much as it would just be like I\u2019d eat out really  <laugh>  more and like I\u2019d probably end up drinking way more or like not having to drink like, when it comes to like, I feel like with like normal like drinks and stuff like it\u2019s fine but like when it comes to alcohol, like I feel like I do try and like choose the cheapest option and I feel like it\u2019s so easy to just like, to find expensive drinks that you do end up liking. So, like, I\u2019d probably end up spending like too much money on drinking like, mm. But the thing is like the more expensive alcohol is, I feel like it tastes better or like, I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s just me or like if it actually is or if it\u2019s just like a placebo type thing where it\u2019s like, \"Oh, it\u2019s more expensive so it tastes better.\" But I don\u2019t know, I feel like I\u2019d spend a lot of money on going out and drinking."]}

From my initial question (line 7) I was able to determine that my participant is an avid user of social media, using it for entertainment purposes as well as using various platforms. This ensures that the questions I ask are relevant to my participant and the answers reflect their social media usage. <nl><nl>Key themes that were discussed by my participant include \"the ideal man\", involving image, appearance and social status; also \"alternate reality\", discussing not only the falseness of social media but also the construction of one's image on social media platforms.<nl><nl>The Ideal Man<nl><nl>The idea of \u2018the ideal man\u2019 featured within my participants answers multiple times, with a construction of what they personally believe to be the ideal man. As opposed to referring to what my participant feels they should look like, my participant instead suggests what others \"should be looking for\" (line 174) in a man, for example, the ideal height \"6 foot 4, or over 6 foot\" (line 175),  the ideal body, having \"six packs\" (line 138), adequate facial hair \"beard\" (line 176) etc. This is a very specific portrayal of men, suggesting that this is a common image for men to hold and strive to achieve. Although men do have an idea of what the ideal body type is they are also aware that in general life, this may not always be the case, with my participant stating that \"It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of me. It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of anyone I know.\" (line 162-163) when asked if he felt represented by men on social media. However, despite this acknowledgement, my participant still felt uncomfortable for comparisons between the appearance of men on social media and himself. My participant used the phrase \"I\u2019d prefer just to leave it at that\" (lines 161 and 294) indicating that men do feel uncomfortable about discussing their appearance, which supports the taboo of men expressing self-doubt and lacking self worth and lowered confidence. This would explain why my participant referred to other people he knows whenever talking about personal appearance, in order to make his answer generalised as opposed to solely him as well as deflect the discomfort about the fact that he is not the ideal man by justifying it with the fact that most people do not look like that. This is supported when he says \"I don\u2019t think many men would want to admit, especially among their peers, wouldn\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re not the ideal person.\" (lines 354-355) <nl><nl>In addition to the body image, a man\u2019s social status and financial status also seems to be prevalent when it comes to describing the \u2018ideal man\u2019 with my participant referring to men with \"seven figures\" (line 138), and men who have \"lavish\" (line 81 ) lifestyles. A given example was the actor and influencer \u2018Dan Bilzerian\u2019; well known for \"constantly flaunting a bunch of money\" (line 241) and \"constantly surrounded by money\". (line 242) This was someone who my participant would refer to as a \u2018role model\u2019 for most males. My participant also referred to the fact that \"men can be successful on social media without looking the greatest\" (line 225), due to their social and financial status. This is supported by the evolutionary psychology theory that women will desire men who are able to provide stability, in the forms of shelter, money, food etc. (Li, Li, Chan &amp; Zhang, 2016). This would explain that now in the digital age, men are able to attract attention with their wealth via social media through posting \"lavish\" (line 81) objects. As it is now commonplace for influencers to be posting this type of content, as my participant stated, \"ordinary people might look at that and think \u2018Well, that\u2019s not me\u2019.\"(line  So this becomes the new goals and the new norm. It is evident that the fact that my participant did not relate to these standards, as when asked if he felt represented by these role models and depictions of men he stated \"No. No. No. No I don\u2019t.\" (line 156) Being unable to relate to the norm often results in incongruence between one's actual self and ideal self which may lower self worth. (Rogers, 1959).<nl><nl>My participant states that they have changed themselves in order to conform with these standards, however wished not to elaborate on how he changed. Instead he referred to people that he knew of, talking about there being  \"a lot of men that will spend a bunch of time at the gym to try and achieve the body that every man wants.\" (lines 347-348) This emphasises that the pressures displayed online and on social media affects men enough for them to wish to change their lifestyle in order to relate to these standards. <nl><nl>Alternate Reality<nl><nl>Throughout my participants answers he refers to the fact that social media is \"not a true depiction\" (line 60) , is a \"very, very fake place\" (lines 104, 71, 63), \"is quite a negative place\" (lines 70, 84) , is \"not real\" (line 107) , is \"very unhealthy\" (line 117), has \"bad sides\" (line 123), is \"the furthest thing from real life\" (lines 147-148) etc. This is common in all the answers, and is said in multiple different ways. My participant referred to social media in very negative ways, and suggested it is a \"toxic\" (line 136) place, despite spending around \"5 hours\" (line 15) per day. This is not an uncommon amount of time on social media, however spending this much time surrounded by something that is perceived as negative by my participant, it is unsurprising that his self confidence is impacted. Also, despite this awareness of the fact that not everything is quite what it seems on social media, the standards are still internalised. This suggests that regardless of the reality or the accuracy of the things that one may be exposed to, they are still accepted by people and becomes the societal norm. My participant also refers to the fact that women are more educated about the ways images are distorted online as opposed to enhancements and photoshop for men.  <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl><nl>From my research, it is evident that despite being aware of the falseness and unrealistic standards of social media, it is evident that young men\u2019s self worth is impacted negatively by the content they are exposed to on social media. Despite being adamant that they are aware of the one sidedness of social media, men continue to make comparisons and draw from this to bring into real life situations. This makes it clear that men experience lowered self confidence not only looks wise but also based on their financial status, social status and more materialistic things. My research has also made it clear that men also feel pressure, and more should be done in terms of support for men online. However, regardless of the gender, social media does tend to display only positive events, making it harder for regular people to accept other events and negative things in real life.", "Hi ,<nl><nl> <nl><nl>I cannot seem to find my result on <system>?<nl><nl>Can you please assist me with this?<nl><nl> <nl><nl>Thankyou,<nl><nl><part_FN><new>Yes I will do!<nl>Thank you <addr7_FN>,<nl><nl><part_FN><new>Hi <addr2_FN>,<nl><nl>Thank you for your quick response.

One is sat down wearing a denim jacket, and she has twists in her hair. The other woman is wearing a black and white stripey top, dark blue jeans and a belt. So number one consists of the lady in the denim jacket sitting down, she\u2019s staring at something and her mouth is wide open. She has quite a surprised, but in a positive way, erm, her facial feature shows that she is looking at something which is surprising. And the other lady, on the right of her, is looking downwards towards something. Erm, also the lady with the black and white stripey top has medium length hair, is quite fair skinned, has dark brown hair going into more of an ombr\u00e9 blonde. Whereas the other lady sat down is, she is a Black lady, with black twists. Also, by the picture, it looks like the lady in the black and white top is showing er, her friend next to her, they look like they know each other. And yeah, they look like they\u2019re friends. They look like they are s- in some sort of maybe school environment. It\u2019s a casual environment, which is seen by the clothes that they are wearing. Another way this picture can also be seen is the lady in the denim jacket is looking, n-not looking at something that the girl in the black and white top is showing her, she\u2019s actually looking at something else, and that she\u2019s surprised by what she\u2019s seen because her mouth is wide open. In the second picture, it looks like erm, there are two boys in this picture. One is of South Asian descent, has short black hair and is wearing a black and red chequered shirt with a white top underneath, and there\u2019s a boy next to him on the, his left. And he\u2019s quite fair skinned, has a black ear piercing, and has short brown hair. He\u2019s wearing a top which consists of black and white flowers with red writing on top, but you can\u2019t read the writing. And the guy in the black and red sweatshirt is staring at a MacBook Air, and, er, looks really interested in what he is reading. Whereas his friend next to him is either staring at him, or there is something that\u2019s distracted him that\u2019s next to the guy in the black and red sweatshirt. From the looks of it, because of how close they are, they look like friends. And they look like university students, or a little bit older. They, yeah, they look around the age of between eighteen to er twenty-two. Yeah. In the background actually there are light green and dark green spots, with a black background, which looks like either a wallpaper or it looks like they\u2019re sitting down on a sofa which has that background. And the table that the MacBook is on is a wooden table with different shades of brown, giving it that timber sort of effect. Yeah. In the third picture, there is a Black female and on her left is a South Asian male. South Asian male has a beard and almost a buzz cut which has grown out. And he is wearing a dark green shirt with a long black coat that has buttons on the side, and also a long collar with beige trousers, dark beige trousers, and he is wearing black trainers. In the background of these two people there is a sort of spiral, almost hypnotising effect, sort of wallpaper. Which is, consists of many small, round, white circles across a black backdrop. The girl is wearing a black top with a black leather jacket, and is holding something in her hand, which I can\u2019t see it. Oh, she\u2019s holding something and it looks like there is also a hand in the picture, next to both of her hands. She\u2019s also wearing dark maroon leggings, with light brown leather boots. There is a table in front of them which has something on the glass table, which consists of either leaflets or pamphlets. And yeah, the male is also holding a book which he\u2019s gone through about, I\u2019d say, fifty per cent of. He looks like he\u2019s in the middle of the book; he looks like he\u2019s about to turn a page. They both are staring at the same thing, it looks like, because their eyes are in the same direction. They are both smiling. Erm, you can tell they\u2019re both quite comfortable with each other because of how close they are sat to each other. It looks like they are almost friends. It also looks like they may be students as well, because that looks like quite a big book. So yeah, number three has, you can tell they\u2019re both looking at something which makes them happy, or is something that is amusing to them. Because neither of them look confused. I-I think they both look eager to know more."]}

So, usually, I would be working so in that case, I would probably wake up, do my normal exercise and then eat but I would eat breakfast at around ten to eleven. So, that would either be pancakes or mostly beans on toast, eggs on toast, anything with my beans, I don\u2019t usually eat normal beans, I like spicy beans, which is a bit weird. But yeah, anything like that. If there\u2019s any, if it\u2019s around lunchtime, it would probably be something frozen so like frozen pizza or like frozen burgers. In my household, we\u2019re not allowed any meat so we\u2019re completely vegetarian in this house. So, that would, so it would probably be like a margherita pizza or, you know, you have those like readymade noodles, could be those. But yeah, lunch would probably be a quick meal. Dinner is probably where we like eat the most. So, dinner for me, so I\u2019m on, I\u2019m  <continental_adj>  so it would typically be Asia-, it would be  <country1_adj>  food or sometimes, it, anything we eat would probably be vegetable orientated. So, it would either be, if it\u2019s Mexican, we\u2019ll have like loads of vegetables in a wrap, we have veg, veggie pasta. We eat dinner at around six to seven and then if any of us are hungry after, there\u2019s always like chocolate or snacks or food that we can eat after but usually, we\u2019re all full by dinner anyways. So yeah, that would be my typical meal. I don\u2019t usually snack in this house but if I\u2019m working then it\u2019s completely different. If I\u2019m working then I\u2019m going to be eating dinner. I mean, I\u2019m going to be eating lunch at work but my lunch will be dinner from the day before.

And that if I, the rest of the day I can go without eating until dinner. For example, today, I just had like two mozzarella and pesto sandwiches. I\u2019m probably not going to be eating until like six or seven p.m. So, that\u2019s, yeah, I would say that\u2019s the most important meal, just \u2018cause you have energy. Otherwise, if you\u2019re waiting for dinner, by then my stomach aches and then you know when you go, you\u2019re in bed and you, you\u2019re just tired because you haven\u2019t eaten?

Do I have to give like a specific restaurant?", "New liberalism was born after a new wave of liberals in the late 19th century to the early 20th century challenged the positions of classical liberals such as Adam Smith and John Locke. Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}

And erm, yeah, it just looks like they\u2019re students on the same sort of course and, you know, just doing a bit of work together. So that\u2019s image two.

This is because from day one it has always been difficult to fully close it - partly due to the design of the cupboard door and the fact that the freezer isn\u2019t working properly and as a result the ice builds up and doesn\u2019t allow it to close. This further prevents the fridge from closing properly in addition to the cupboard design door. This ongoing issue has resulted in numerous amounts of food not being kept properly and the unfortunate throwing away of them. We are all experiencing hard times as we attempt to continue living with COVID19, therefore the continuous cycle of buying food and it going off due to a dysfucntional and ineffective fridge makes these times just that much harder.<nl><nl>A contractor was sent out once and the service he provided was not good enough as this is still a very important issue - if not the most important as it directly effects our health and safety.<nl><nl>Another issue in the kitchen is that one of the lower cabinet doors has come off. I believe the inside components have snapped and the repair will require new parts.<nl><nl>The last of the issues in the kitchen is the metal wall section behind the sink. The bottom part of it has opened and essentially began to peel off. This also needs to be fixed because if its allowed to continue peeling the wall behind it will start to get wet from the sink and cause further damage to the property.<nl><nl>In line with maintenance requests, it has also been brought to my attention that the top floor tenant is extremely unhappy with the mattress she is having to use as she says all she can feel is the springs within it. This causes severe joint and shoulder pain - again this is important as it has a direct impact on her health. If this could be replaced it would be most helpful, as we are timely paying tenants who don\u2019t believe this to be an unjust request.<nl><nl>I did contact the <business> property management mobile contact number ending 152, I was directed to report all maintenance issues through property file.

One is sat down wearing a denim jacket, and she has twists in her hair. The other woman is wearing a black and white stripey top, dark blue jeans and a belt. So number one consists of the lady in the denim jacket sitting down, she\u2019s staring at something and her mouth is wide open. She has quite a surprised, but in a positive way, erm, her facial feature shows that she is looking at something which is surprising. And the other lady, on the right of her, is looking downwards towards something. Erm, also the lady with the black and white stripey top has medium length hair, is quite fair skinned, has dark brown hair going into more of an ombr\u00e9 blonde. Whereas the other lady sat down is, she is a Black lady, with black twists. Also, by the picture, it looks like the lady in the black and white top is showing er, her friend next to her, they look like they know each other. And yeah, they look like they\u2019re friends. They look like they are s- in some sort of maybe school environment. It\u2019s a casual environment, which is seen by the clothes that they are wearing. Another way this picture can also be seen is the lady in the denim jacket is looking, n-not looking at something that the girl in the black and white top is showing her, she\u2019s actually looking at something else, and that she\u2019s surprised by what she\u2019s seen because her mouth is wide open. In the second picture, it looks like erm, there are two boys in this picture. One is of South Asian descent, has short black hair and is wearing a black and red chequered shirt with a white top underneath, and there\u2019s a boy next to him on the, his left. And he\u2019s quite fair skinned, has a black ear piercing, and has short brown hair. He\u2019s wearing a top which consists of black and white flowers with red writing on top, but you can\u2019t read the writing. And the guy in the black and red sweatshirt is staring at a MacBook Air, and, er, looks really interested in what he is reading. Whereas his friend next to him is either staring at him, or there is something that\u2019s distracted him that\u2019s next to the guy in the black and red sweatshirt. From the looks of it, because of how close they are, they look like friends. And they look like university students, or a little bit older. They, yeah, they look around the age of between eighteen to er twenty-two. Yeah. In the background actually there are light green and dark green spots, with a black background, which looks like either a wallpaper or it looks like they\u2019re sitting down on a sofa which has that background. And the table that the MacBook is on is a wooden table with different shades of brown, giving it that timber sort of effect. Yeah. In the third picture, there is a Black female and on her left is a South Asian male. South Asian male has a beard and almost a buzz cut which has grown out. And he is wearing a dark green shirt with a long black coat that has buttons on the side, and also a long collar with beige trousers, dark beige trousers, and he is wearing black trainers. In the background of these two people there is a sort of spiral, almost hypnotising effect, sort of wallpaper. Which is, consists of many small, round, white circles across a black backdrop. The girl is wearing a black top with a black leather jacket, and is holding something in her hand, which I can\u2019t see it. Oh, she\u2019s holding something and it looks like there is also a hand in the picture, next to both of her hands. She\u2019s also wearing dark maroon leggings, with light brown leather boots. There is a table in front of them which has something on the glass table, which consists of either leaflets or pamphlets. And yeah, the male is also holding a book which he\u2019s gone through about, I\u2019d say, fifty per cent of. He looks like he\u2019s in the middle of the book; he looks like he\u2019s about to turn a page. They both are staring at the same thing, it looks like, because their eyes are in the same direction. They are both smiling. Erm, you can tell they\u2019re both quite comfortable with each other because of how close they are sat to each other. It looks like they are almost friends. It also looks like they may be students as well, because that looks like quite a big book. So yeah, number three has, you can tell they\u2019re both looking at something which makes them happy, or is something that is amusing to them. Because neither of them look confused. I-I think they both look eager to know more.", "<unintelligible><new>It was crazy. When your body gets used to not eating meat, you will feel sick when you eat it after a long time. And I didn\u2019t know that was a thing, \u2018cause.<new>Yeah, it was, I could not, I have nit, I was sweating when the room was cold, it was so bad. Like my parents were like, \"What is wrong with you? Like do you have Covid?\" I didn\u2019t have Covid, it was just \u2018cause I ate meat. Yeah, I know, it was bad  <laugh> .<new>So, I think I would one hundred percent cut milk out of my diet. If I could find a dairy free alternative for cheese, I would. I think the benefits of eating fish, however, are underestimated. So, I think I would actually keep fit in my diet but I would cut out the pork completely. I don\u2019t eat beef anyway, so that\u2019s not a problem, I just stick to chicken and fish and try and cut out dairy. I think if I had, if I had them, all the money and I didn\u2019t have like restrictions upon my household, that\u2019s what I would do. But I would also try and find different alternatives. So, sugar wise as well. I eat a lot of refined sugar and it can have a really bad impact on my, my skin and how I feel as well. And I think another,  <unintelligible>  was looking into it. So, I was, erm, pardon me, I used to do food tech back when I did my GCSEs and then last year, erm, I don\u2019t know, have you heard of  <restaurant5> ? It\u2019s right next to  <university> .<new>I, I was a chef there first year of uni.<new>Yeah, I was a chef there and I loved it. I don\u2019t know how I got the job but yeah, so. And I was seeing what was literally put into all these meals because I was the one making them, I was serving them. And, erm, I just realised that  <unintelligible>  . So, I looked up, erm, like coconut as a substitute and I would look at other substitutes. They are a li-little bit more expensive. Or even this brown sugar, stuff like that, just trying to like, yeah, less, less refined the better, obviously. So yeah, I reckon I would start looking up sugar alternatives if I had a  <unintelligible> , I had the money. Yeah."]}

{"id": "16cbdfa8-aff2-48b4-aad1-bd7de9d59d9005699", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["The Modern State is seen to have five key features: sovereignty, public institutions, territorial association, legitimation and domination (D\u2019Amato, 2018). These characteristics can be highlighted as territory (an area with defined borders), external and internal sovereignty where a state must be able to defend its territory and not be too dependent on another power. A state achieves sovereignty when it is recognised by the family of states as the \u2018sole governing authority within its territory and as the legal equal of other states\u2019 (The Modern State, 2020). Furthermore, there has to be legitimacy in which there is recognised rule, examples of this are traditional legitimacy, charismatic legitimacy and rational-legal legitimacy; the legitimacy enhances a state\u2019s sovereignty at a lower cost. The last characteristic is modern bureaucracy, this is required to generate as well as collect revenue. In this essay we will be discussing and critically examining Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, who criticizes the moralistic view of authority. Machiavelli although seen as an evil man, had a large influence on the future of modern civilisation especially in comparison to the artists of his time. <nl><nl>For Machiavelli, moral basis on which to judge the difference between illegitimate and legitimate uses of power does not exist, arguing that this does not add to the actual possession of power \u2013 rather the legitimacy rests upon the threat of coercive force. His beliefs rest in those that the leaders should avoid the common values of justice and mercy in preference to the use of violence and fear, particularly if it is in the best interest such as through gaining and expanding political power. Historians have stated Machiavelli to be the \u2018teacher of evil\u2019 such as Leo Strauss (McShea, 1963). However, Machiavelli has been credited with formulating the \"modern concept of the state\", that is understood in the Weberian sense of a \u2018form of rule possessing a monopoly of coercive authority within a set territorial boundary\u2019 (Nederman, 2019). Machiavelli derived his views from the experience of the Caesura Borgia.  However, Machiavelli did contribute to the way we understand the modern state now as he proposed his own conception of the \"civil principality\" whilst subverting his previous medieval idea of state as regime (Sellers,2015). However, it should be noted that force is not the only weapon to rule the people so his argument can be seen as psychologically weak.<nl><nl>Machiavelli also states that principality can be seen to be governed by a single ruler and is helped by anointed ministers which is the case in many current states seen today. Machiavelli states that the idea of taking over depends on the character of region than the character of the prince, he has the strong belief that the citizens will recollect and fight for their liberty. Although we have grown out of medieval brutality, it can be argued that the modern-day equivalent of killing is to send rivals to jail or allow opponents to lose if there is indecisiveness. An example of this is Brexit, where the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was seen as indecisive and therefore could not gain enough votes in time for the referendum. Another way Machiavelli is modernised is through the idea that leaders will need to make severe decisions, such as through firing a member of the cabinet. An example of this is the Night of Long Knives in 1962 where Macmillan sacked a third of his cabinet. Nevertheless, Machiavelli ignored individualism and had one sided views of human nature which can be viewed as a critical flaw.<nl><nl>For Machiavelli, law is also impossible to follow without the required military as arms are a requirement in order for leaders to establish great frameworks. Although it can be criticised as we do not follow medieval combat, there are still some aspects which apply to the modern state, for instance the concept that an army from your own principality is most beneficial for defending yourself \u2013 and this concept is universally accepted. Machiavelli also made the point that there is conflict of interest which can be seen in the modern state also, for example through the leak of the Panama papers. What is also seen in the modern state is Machiavelli\u2019s view on auxiliary troops being faithful to someone else, for example through the rise of the Taliban, as although it was intended for the Taliban to fight the Soviet Union, they later turned and became the lead terrorist group. In Antonio Negri\u2019s view, Machiavelli belongs to a \u2018political alternative of modern thought grounded on a revolutionary version of constituent power\u2019 (Negri and Maurizia Boscagli, 2009). However, Quentin Skinner and J.G.A Pocock write that we should regard Machiavelli as part of the republican tradition, i.e. as part of the living legacy of Aristotelian philosophy (Roecklein, 2012). Nonetheless, Machiavelli was the first modern thinker to have thought of the State as an independent entity and not recognising any religious organisation exterior to it and The Prince has been a choice of several political leaders such as Louis XIV, Napoleon Bonaparte and Benito Mussolini. <nl><nl>The modern state was \u2018constituted by an abstraction from personal to impersonal rule\u2019 (Mansfield, 1983). With Machiavelli we encounter a challenge to the classical regime which is expressed in his use of stato (his stato is someone\u2019s to acquire), whereas for Aristotle\u2019s regime there is some ordering of the inhabitants of the city. The central theme of Machiavelli\u2019s political ideas is power with absolute state being the end. The state is viewed as superior to all associations and is sovereign as well as autonomous however he also stated that religion cannot influence politics and the church cannot control the state, which is not the case. <nl><nl>Comparing Machiavelli to other theorists allows for us to critically evaluate him further. Plato had the vision of every human being born into a division which was maintained and creating an arrangement for the state in the course of classism whereas Machiavelli proposed with the aim of sovereignty to support the nation in which the leader controls and protects its citizens. Machiavelli\u2019s concept of virt\u00fa highlights the utilitarian needs of the country. For Machiavelli virt\u00fa outweighs virtue in times of need whilst Plato believes a \u2018just ruler must behave the same at all times\u2019 however we have to consider they were writing in different eras, as Plato\u2019s philosophy is based on utopian principles and Machiavelli is viewed as a realist (Abrams, M, 2017). Aristotle divides government into two categories: good and bad with good forms fall aristocracy and under bad fall oligarchy. Aristotle wanted to help society achieve goodness through politics whereas on the other hand Machiavelli sought to achieve the maintenance of power and stability. They have differing views in terms of Aristotle claimed that if an entire state is made to fear their ruler, this would cause unhappiness however Machiavelli suggested that it is better to be feared than loved as it creates balance. However, they are on similar sides when it comes to liberation, as in the Prince it stated such ruler should not dictate the actions of others, but all together Machiavelli was seeking a practical type of politics whilst Aristotle took a rather idealistic approach (Tabone, 2020).  <nl><nl>Hobbes and Machiavelli have fascinating ideas on human nature impacting the state as the common theme is the usage of fear, meaning power needs to be acquired and maintained but we have to remember that Machiavelli\u2019s time period involved the peak of absolutism and hierarchies. Philosophers such a John Locke have directly opposing views on government. Locke\u2019s perception of revolt as a right gave people excessive power compared to the government, this did not exist during the time of Machiavelli. Locke believed in the idea of the government working for the people, however this is directly opposed to Machiavelli\u2019s thought that the ruler should do what it takes to remain in power (Chris Joseph, 2014). Machiavelli recommended that coercion should be used in order to govern whereas Locke favoured a social contract with the concept of dual accountability. Although Machiavelli\u2019s concept of coercion is flawed, he did recognise that rulers could not govern by this alone and advocated for the use of cunning and subterfuge, Locke\u2019s social contract did not contain an element of this. Machiavelli had a pessimistic view of individuals and believed human beings are fundamentally bad whereas Locke was more optimistic. In the modern state it follows Machiavelli\u2019s model more as the rulers in the modern state are comprised of the rich and powerful in society. Mill and Machiavelli also have the same solution to government in freedom of speech, they are both aware that people cannot have a hand in ruling itself. <nl><nl>Political leaders and their followers believed that Machiavellism was a disease infesting the politic body. He is still regarded with a negative reputation, but he still aids us to understand the modern state. Machiavelli promoted the central role of a citizen in preserving institutions which is reflected through the meaning of the Second Amendment in the U.S. Constitution (Bernard, 2009). Among modern believers of Machiavelli, there are Burmese generals such as Web Jiabao, the Former Premier of China and Lord Mandelson (Bernard, 2009). Machiavelli and Pareto agree in terms of this where they say egotism or selfishness as a natural property of the human species (Femia, 2013). According to Machiavellism though, the principle aim of prince is the unification as well as welfare of the state which showed reality of practical politics. He deduced that the internal unity and powerful government were the essential of any state by observing the affairs of the interstate rivalries. The sole aim of the prince is also to increase power in ways such as to be an expert in managing and organising a war- power is seen as the only reason of the state. <nl><nl>To conclude Machiavelli contributes to the \u2018comprehension of constituent power as a living force within social order\u2019 (Lucchese, 2016). He developed a revolutionary position, suggesting that political conflict is not a destabilising factor, but rather the grounding force of free republics. His concepts and ideas are often misunderstood as he displayed rare intellect to become a partisan in an age where absolute monarchy held control (Mathur, 1991). All together Machiavelli was the first thinker who justified secular state and the first advocate for autonomy for the state. He unfairly became associated with evil through his critical work written about The Prince, and although it did not get translated until almost a hundred years later the negative view about Machiavelli had already been established into Elizabethan England. All together he communicated priority to the state and put it above morality and religion as it is the highest form of social organisation and most essential to promote human welfare, and this is seen clearly in the modern state. Machiavelli\u2019s Prince dealt exclusively with the interests of a single person of power that focuses on only the leader\u2019s welfare in mind whereas the theories of Plato, Aristotle, Locke and Mill dealt with the welfare of society. However, in the modern state there Machiavelli did consider that the Prince needed to maintain good relations with the people which is what we observe. It can be agreed the way that Machiavelli talks about the state as Machiavelli was a realist.", "It was.<new>Surprisingly, I\u2019ve never tried crab.

But when it comes to like dairy free chocolate and stuff like, we\u2019re trying. I know my sister\u2019s new year\u2019s resolution is to go vegan for the year. So, I\u2019m the only one my hou-, my dad and I are the only people in the household that eat meat. So, my mum and my sister\u2019s vegetarian. So, it just mean my whole life I have not eaten meat. So, I, I c-, I could go without eating meat in my whole life one hundred percent. It\u2019s just I think in terms of when I was younger, I didn\u2019t like the food that my mum gave me, if that makes sense. Sometimes when you eat too many vegetables, you\u2019re like, it make you ki-, it makes you sick and then you realise you\u2019re not getting the nutrients you need. So, that\u2019s the only reason why I switched to eating meat. But apart from that, I\u2019m a hundred percent vouch  <unintelligible> . I think even at Nando\u2019s now, to this day, I will still get a beanie burger, like I wo-, I won\u2019t get the chicken option just because,  <misc> , I don\u2019t know what that burger tastes like and I would, I don\u2019t even want to eat meat. But then again, when you have like a really nice meat option, I\u2019m bound to choose the meat option. But yeah, I think, I would love to go completely vegetarian. And right now, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen, you know, like Beyond Burger and stuff like, new, new brands that have come up, I\u2019m a big fan of Beyond Burger or Quorn, I eat it all. So, the, the, the, recently, they\u2019ve started, there\u2019s more brands as well, isn\u2019t there? So, recently they\u2019re getting there but, yeah, I completely vouch for it. I think one day... I also think going vegan is extremely expensive like we were looking at, erm, alternatives. So, I don\u2019t drink milk, I only drink soya milk. And although, actually, it\u2019s gotten a lot cheaper, other vegan alternatives are just, they\u2019re so expensive. I think, and it\u2019s, er, living in a house with your parents, I think unle-, until I move out and I can like, I\u2019m the one shopping for myself, I think it\u2019s not worth it. I think right now I\u2019ll stick to like food that we do eat now but yeah, I\u2019m quite happy being a vegetarian, like  <unintelligible> . The, ger-, the weird thing, actually, you know the first lockdown, it was from March until about August, I think and some restaurants and stuff opened. I, my grandparents were around and they\u2019re from India, but I didn\u2019t eat any meat from March to August. And when I went out for the first time, I ate a lot of meat. My body ended up rejecting all of it. So, I felt s-sick and it, I know it was so bad. I had  <unintelligible> , I was throwing up everywhere, I couldn\u2019t move, like I had to crawl down the stairs and like in tears, like  <unintelligible> , just so I could like  <unintelligible>  scream to get my parents\u2019 attention. Yeah, my body rejected it all. So, like after that, my parents were like, \"Okay, small amount of meat and do it slowly.\" And ever since then, I get really scared that if I have  <unintelligible> . That\u2019s why I think right now  <unintelligible>  open, I try and eat meat maybe once a week so my body doesn\u2019t get to what it did last year because yeah, oh, that was awful. I, I, I was going to die, like it was so bad. But yeah, so it\u2019s all good now  <laugh> ."]}

{"id": "fb15b8dc-dbf4-4d08-b13d-0c10e36ec36802220", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["The Modern State is seen to have five key features: sovereignty, public institutions, territorial association, legitimation and domination (D\u2019Amato, 2018). These characteristics can be highlighted as territory (an area with defined borders), external and internal sovereignty where a state must be able to defend its territory and not be too dependent on another power. A state achieves sovereignty when it is recognised by the family of states as the \u2018sole governing authority within its territory and as the legal equal of other states\u2019 (The Modern State, 2020). Furthermore, there has to be legitimacy in which there is recognised rule, examples of this are traditional legitimacy, charismatic legitimacy and rational-legal legitimacy; the legitimacy enhances a state\u2019s sovereignty at a lower cost. The last characteristic is modern bureaucracy, this is required to generate as well as collect revenue. In this essay we will be discussing and critically examining Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, who criticizes the moralistic view of authority. Machiavelli although seen as an evil man, had a large influence on the future of modern civilisation especially in comparison to the artists of his time. <nl><nl>For Machiavelli, moral basis on which to judge the difference between illegitimate and legitimate uses of power does not exist, arguing that this does not add to the actual possession of power \u2013 rather the legitimacy rests upon the threat of coercive force. His beliefs rest in those that the leaders should avoid the common values of justice and mercy in preference to the use of violence and fear, particularly if it is in the best interest such as through gaining and expanding political power. Historians have stated Machiavelli to be the \u2018teacher of evil\u2019 such as Leo Strauss (McShea, 1963). However, Machiavelli has been credited with formulating the \"modern concept of the state\", that is understood in the Weberian sense of a \u2018form of rule possessing a monopoly of coercive authority within a set territorial boundary\u2019 (Nederman, 2019). Machiavelli derived his views from the experience of the Caesura Borgia.  However, Machiavelli did contribute to the way we understand the modern state now as he proposed his own conception of the \"civil principality\" whilst subverting his previous medieval idea of state as regime (Sellers,2015). However, it should be noted that force is not the only weapon to rule the people so his argument can be seen as psychologically weak.<nl><nl>Machiavelli also states that principality can be seen to be governed by a single ruler and is helped by anointed ministers which is the case in many current states seen today. Machiavelli states that the idea of taking over depends on the character of region than the character of the prince, he has the strong belief that the citizens will recollect and fight for their liberty. Although we have grown out of medieval brutality, it can be argued that the modern-day equivalent of killing is to send rivals to jail or allow opponents to lose if there is indecisiveness. An example of this is Brexit, where the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was seen as indecisive and therefore could not gain enough votes in time for the referendum. Another way Machiavelli is modernised is through the idea that leaders will need to make severe decisions, such as through firing a member of the cabinet. An example of this is the Night of Long Knives in 1962 where Macmillan sacked a third of his cabinet. Nevertheless, Machiavelli ignored individualism and had one sided views of human nature which can be viewed as a critical flaw.<nl><nl>For Machiavelli, law is also impossible to follow without the required military as arms are a requirement in order for leaders to establish great frameworks. Although it can be criticised as we do not follow medieval combat, there are still some aspects which apply to the modern state, for instance the concept that an army from your own principality is most beneficial for defending yourself \u2013 and this concept is universally accepted. Machiavelli also made the point that there is conflict of interest which can be seen in the modern state also, for example through the leak of the Panama papers. What is also seen in the modern state is Machiavelli\u2019s view on auxiliary troops being faithful to someone else, for example through the rise of the Taliban, as although it was intended for the Taliban to fight the Soviet Union, they later turned and became the lead terrorist group. In Antonio Negri\u2019s view, Machiavelli belongs to a \u2018political alternative of modern thought grounded on a revolutionary version of constituent power\u2019 (Negri and Maurizia Boscagli, 2009). However, Quentin Skinner and J.G.A Pocock write that we should regard Machiavelli as part of the republican tradition, i.e. as part of the living legacy of Aristotelian philosophy (Roecklein, 2012). Nonetheless, Machiavelli was the first modern thinker to have thought of the State as an independent entity and not recognising any religious organisation exterior to it and The Prince has been a choice of several political leaders such as Louis XIV, Napoleon Bonaparte and Benito Mussolini. <nl><nl>The modern state was \u2018constituted by an abstraction from personal to impersonal rule\u2019 (Mansfield, 1983). With Machiavelli we encounter a challenge to the classical regime which is expressed in his use of stato (his stato is someone\u2019s to acquire), whereas for Aristotle\u2019s regime there is some ordering of the inhabitants of the city. The central theme of Machiavelli\u2019s political ideas is power with absolute state being the end. The state is viewed as superior to all associations and is sovereign as well as autonomous however he also stated that religion cannot influence politics and the church cannot control the state, which is not the case. <nl><nl>Comparing Machiavelli to other theorists allows for us to critically evaluate him further. Plato had the vision of every human being born into a division which was maintained and creating an arrangement for the state in the course of classism whereas Machiavelli proposed with the aim of sovereignty to support the nation in which the leader controls and protects its citizens. Machiavelli\u2019s concept of virt\u00fa highlights the utilitarian needs of the country. For Machiavelli virt\u00fa outweighs virtue in times of need whilst Plato believes a \u2018just ruler must behave the same at all times\u2019 however we have to consider they were writing in different eras, as Plato\u2019s philosophy is based on utopian principles and Machiavelli is viewed as a realist (Abrams, M, 2017). Aristotle divides government into two categories: good and bad with good forms fall aristocracy and under bad fall oligarchy. Aristotle wanted to help society achieve goodness through politics whereas on the other hand Machiavelli sought to achieve the maintenance of power and stability. They have differing views in terms of Aristotle claimed that if an entire state is made to fear their ruler, this would cause unhappiness however Machiavelli suggested that it is better to be feared than loved as it creates balance. However, they are on similar sides when it comes to liberation, as in the Prince it stated such ruler should not dictate the actions of others, but all together Machiavelli was seeking a practical type of politics whilst Aristotle took a rather idealistic approach (Tabone, 2020).  <nl><nl>Hobbes and Machiavelli have fascinating ideas on human nature impacting the state as the common theme is the usage of fear, meaning power needs to be acquired and maintained but we have to remember that Machiavelli\u2019s time period involved the peak of absolutism and hierarchies. Philosophers such a John Locke have directly opposing views on government. Locke\u2019s perception of revolt as a right gave people excessive power compared to the government, this did not exist during the time of Machiavelli. Locke believed in the idea of the government working for the people, however this is directly opposed to Machiavelli\u2019s thought that the ruler should do what it takes to remain in power (Chris Joseph, 2014). Machiavelli recommended that coercion should be used in order to govern whereas Locke favoured a social contract with the concept of dual accountability. Although Machiavelli\u2019s concept of coercion is flawed, he did recognise that rulers could not govern by this alone and advocated for the use of cunning and subterfuge, Locke\u2019s social contract did not contain an element of this. Machiavelli had a pessimistic view of individuals and believed human beings are fundamentally bad whereas Locke was more optimistic. In the modern state it follows Machiavelli\u2019s model more as the rulers in the modern state are comprised of the rich and powerful in society. Mill and Machiavelli also have the same solution to government in freedom of speech, they are both aware that people cannot have a hand in ruling itself. <nl><nl>Political leaders and their followers believed that Machiavellism was a disease infesting the politic body. He is still regarded with a negative reputation, but he still aids us to understand the modern state. Machiavelli promoted the central role of a citizen in preserving institutions which is reflected through the meaning of the Second Amendment in the U.S. Constitution (Bernard, 2009). Among modern believers of Machiavelli, there are Burmese generals such as Web Jiabao, the Former Premier of China and Lord Mandelson (Bernard, 2009). Machiavelli and Pareto agree in terms of this where they say egotism or selfishness as a natural property of the human species (Femia, 2013). According to Machiavellism though, the principle aim of prince is the unification as well as welfare of the state which showed reality of practical politics. He deduced that the internal unity and powerful government were the essential of any state by observing the affairs of the interstate rivalries. The sole aim of the prince is also to increase power in ways such as to be an expert in managing and organising a war- power is seen as the only reason of the state. <nl><nl>To conclude Machiavelli contributes to the \u2018comprehension of constituent power as a living force within social order\u2019 (Lucchese, 2016). He developed a revolutionary position, suggesting that political conflict is not a destabilising factor, but rather the grounding force of free republics. His concepts and ideas are often misunderstood as he displayed rare intellect to become a partisan in an age where absolute monarchy held control (Mathur, 1991). All together Machiavelli was the first thinker who justified secular state and the first advocate for autonomy for the state. He unfairly became associated with evil through his critical work written about The Prince, and although it did not get translated until almost a hundred years later the negative view about Machiavelli had already been established into Elizabethan England. All together he communicated priority to the state and put it above morality and religion as it is the highest form of social organisation and most essential to promote human welfare, and this is seen clearly in the modern state. Machiavelli\u2019s Prince dealt exclusively with the interests of a single person of power that focuses on only the leader\u2019s welfare in mind whereas the theories of Plato, Aristotle, Locke and Mill dealt with the welfare of society. However, in the modern state there Machiavelli did consider that the Prince needed to maintain good relations with the people which is what we observe. It can be agreed the way that Machiavelli talks about the state as Machiavelli was a realist.", "Is is possible if I can change my <subject> grade to grade 8, <subject> grade to grade 7, and <subject> grade to grade 7.

So, I snack quite a bit more than actually cooking and eating, cooking and eating four meals, like I should be doing. So yeah, it\u2019s just due to the convenience, I would rather grab a snack than having to wait in the queues and all of that.

Due to contralateral processing, P3 should remain inattentive when shown a stimuli on the left. By using EEG, alpha activity can be recorded when shown a stimuli cued left or cued right. Event markers allow for it to be clear when the participant is shown the stimuli, and the alpha activity was recorded. The results showed that there was a significantly higher in left than right cue condition, and supported the hypothesis.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha activity refers to electrical impulses oscillating at 8-13Hz , this is an alpha wave. These brain waves begin in the cerebral cortex (Moini &amp; Piran, 2020) and occur during periods of inattention, where one is in a restful state, whilst being awake, examples of this is when closing eyes, meditating (Lagopoulos et al., 2009), daydreaming etc.  When the brain begins to focus on stimuli, alpha waves are suppressed. The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007), proposes that high alpha indicates disengagement and inhibition of task irrelevant brain areas. In task relevant brain areas, alpha remains low, supporting that alpha activity is modulated by attention.  <nl><nl>This hypothesis is supported by Magosso et al, 2019, which used a regular setting and a VR (virtual reality) setting to see if the intensity of the task and the levels of attention required affects alpha frequency. The results showed that alpha signals are suppressed when having to give attention to tasks although it seems that when isolated from all external features (when participating in VR) alpha activity becomes greater. This suggests that it is the modulation and diversion of attention which causes changes in alpha frequencies.<nl><nl>Sauseng et al (2005) presented participants with directional cues indicating which hemifield the target stimuli would appear in. The target stimuli consisted of either small or large bars which participants identified and responded with \u2018s\u2019 for small and \u2018l\u2019 for large. Results showed that there was stronger alpha frequency suppression in brain areas contralateral to the targeted hemifield. This is due to visual stimuli being processed contralaterally. 200ms before the stimuli was presented, in active processing areas like the parietal lobe (P3), the alpha range is also lower. This study is supportive of AIM (Klimesch et al, 2007), and is used as the basis for this experiment, as it is a partial replication. In this experiment, the focus will be on the effect of arrow cues, specifically the direction they are facing.<nl><nl>Hypothesis<nl>As AIH states, alpha range activity is present in areas that are uninvolved in active processing and is suppressed in areas that actively process. By directing attention, and cueing the participant to expect the stimuli in a specific region they will begin paying attention. As shown by Sauseng et al (2005), visual stimuli is processed contralaterally resulting in alpha suppression in the other side of the brain. For example, if the stimuli is present in the left visual field it will be processed by the right hemisphere. By using the left parietal cortex (P3) to record alpha activity, it is expected that alpha activity will be greater when a stimulus is shown on the left and for this activity to be suppressed when the stimuli is on the right.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 undergraduate students were participants chosen from an opportunity sample.<nl><nl>Design<nl>This experiment uses a within subjects design. The dependent variable is the alpha range amplitudes (microvolts) on the left hand side of the parietal lobe (P3). The independent variable is the direction of the arrow cue, with two levels, left or right. <nl>Materials<nl>This experiment used a Biopac MP36 to collect data, EEG electrodes, AC Cream, Abrasive paste, PsychoPy to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device and stimuli (see figure 1). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG by opening the Biopac student lab. From the \u2018analog\u2019 tab select Electroencaphagram (EEG)\u2019 \u20180.5-100Hz wnotch\u2019, so the 50Hz band is filtered out. Digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker.. The \u2018calculation\u2019 tab allowed alpha frequency to be recorded. Then select \u2018EEG alpha 8-13Hz\u2019 from the drop down list. The sampling rate was 1000Hz. The participant was then prepared to be attached to the EEG. The electrode sites were abraded with everi cream using a cotton bud, and then AC cream was put on the electrodes. The electrodes are placed using the 1020 system. The active electrode was placed on P3. Participants were then given a cued visual task. A fixation cross was cued at the centre of the screen for 34ms, followed by an arrow indicating where to focus attention, with a 50% chance of it being cued left or right. There was then an interval of 600-800ms followed by a fixation cross for the second time, finally the participant was shown the target stimuli for 50ms, either a large or small white bar against a black background. Participants were then asked to use the keyboard to respond to the stimuli, typing either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. 75% of the trials were valid (the target stimuli was presented in the same hemifield that the arrow cue indicated), and 25% were invalid (the target stimuli was presented in the other hemifield). There were 20 blocks of the four trial types (cue left with a small bar, cue right with a small bar, cue left with a large bar and cue right with a large bar) so in total there were 80 trials.<nl><nl>Results<nl>There were transformations applied to the raw 9-13Hz alpha EEG data. There were eventmarkers received by PsychoPy through the Stimtracker, in order to identify when the stimuli was presented to the participants. The data also was used to specifically analyse from 200ms prior to stimulus onset after the directional arrow cues had been shown. Furthermore, the data was rectified, making negative values positive despite them showing excitatory or inhibitory activity. The samples were also averaged in order to limit the impact that outlying values would have on the data. This data is referred to as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl><nl>Descriptive Statistics<nl><table><nl><nl>Inferential Statistics <nl>The wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T=566, n=38, p=.002).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results of this experiment show that there was a significantly higher level of alpha activity when the stimulus was shown on the left hand side, this fit the original hypothesis. These results are consistent with AIH (Klimesch et al, 2007) as it shows that when participants are given a stimulus in their left hemifield, due to contralateral processing, this is processed by the right part of brain areas. As we were looking at P3, the left side of the parietal lobe, when shown a cue on the left it was processed on the right, meaning the left was task irrelevant and inattentive, resulting in higher alpha activity.<nl><nl>Methodological Problems<nl>Factors which may have confounded data include artefacts, which is when the EEG is contaminated by excess movement. When eye movements take place, the electrical activity could be recorded as brain activity. Eye movements could be blinking or horizontal eye movement, especially when having to look at either side of the screen. Blinking could also pose other issues such as the participant missing the cue. However, it does not seem to be too much of an issue and repetition and more trials would minimise the effects of this.<nl>Another issue could be the laboratory setting, as this could have an affect on brain activity. This is not a very normal situation for participants to be placed in so they may be uncomfortable or more alert as they know they are being studied. This could impact the EEG recordings as it is not a life-like situation so the results may not be generalisable to the whole population.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Overall, the data is valid despite minor methodological issues, which after replication can minimise the effect of individual differences, such as blinking and horizontal eye movement. The data also supports AIH and produced the expected results.", "Okay. So, I wake up quite late so I don\u2019t really eat, eat anything in the morning.

I'm writing this email on behalf of us all in regards to the maintenance of the house.<nl><nl>Firstly, the fridge has been a recurring problem. This is because from day one it has always been difficult to fully close it - partly due to the design of the cupboard door and the fact that the freezer isn\u2019t working properly and as a result the ice builds up and doesn\u2019t allow it to close. This further prevents the fridge from closing properly in addition to the cupboard design door. This ongoing issue has resulted in numerous amounts of food not being kept properly and the unfortunate throwing away of them. We are all experiencing hard times as we attempt to continue living with COVID19, therefore the continuous cycle of buying food and it going off due to a dysfucntional and ineffective fridge makes these times just that much harder.<nl><nl>A contractor was sent out once and the service he provided was not good enough as this is still a very important issue - if not the most important as it directly effects our health and safety.<nl><nl>Another issue in the kitchen is that one of the lower cabinet doors has come off. I believe the inside components have snapped and the repair will require new parts.<nl><nl>The last of the issues in the kitchen is the metal wall section behind the sink. The bottom part of it has opened and essentially began to peel off. This also needs to be fixed because if its allowed to continue peeling the wall behind it will start to get wet from the sink and cause further damage to the property.<nl><nl>In line with maintenance requests, it has also been brought to my attention that the top floor tenant is extremely unhappy with the mattress she is having to use as she says all she can feel is the springs within it. This causes severe joint and shoulder pain - again this is important as it has a direct impact on her health. If this could be replaced it would be most helpful, as we are timely paying tenants who don\u2019t believe this to be an unjust request.<nl><nl>I did contact the <business> property management mobile contact number ending 152, I was directed to report all maintenance issues through property file.

And erm, the student is sitting in the chair with her braids, and she\u2019s smiling quite a bit with her teeth showing as well.

And they\u2019re both, er, sitting behind a Mac, and they\u2019re just looking at the computer.

Erm, he\u2019s wearing some, er, brown khaki trousers \u2013 no, brown trousers, yeah. And er, the lady\u2019s wearing some brown boots with red leggings, I would say. Erm, you can\u2019t really see it too caref- too well, but er, she\u2019s got some earrings I think, that are dangling. So er, yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it. So yeah, I would say they\u2019re, they\u2019re both students as well, because they\u2019ve got a book. And er, I don\u2019t know who the third character in the picture is as we can\u2019t really see, but we can just see one of his hands. But yeah. And there\u2019s a leaflet on the glass coffee table in front of them. And that\u2019s it for picture three."]}
{"id": "fe462bb0-5447-433d-90cd-63d0eb08bdbe", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl><nl>With the average person in the UK spending 110 minutes on social media, it is inevitable that content displayed across these platforms impact and influence societal norms. The nature of social media aids the ability for societal norms to not only be fueled and accepted across various cultures but also enable this to occur at an accelerated pace. However, the media has been proven to impact self-evaluation in a negative way. For example, there are numerous studies looking at women\u2019s self-evaluation, comparing weight-esteem based on neutral images or ideal images (Brown, Novick, Lord, &amp; Richards, 1992); self-worth based on social comparison (Jones &amp; Buckingham, 2005) etc. Unfortunately, looking at the effects on self-worth in men is minimal. This may be due to the rhetoric that portrays men as emotionless and when any type of emotion is displayed, idioms and phrases like \u2018be a man\u2019 or \u2018stop being a baby\u2019 comes into play. Due to this societal norm, it may make it difficult for men to be able to find appropriate support online and on social media platforms when struggling with the negative impact these sites can have on self worth. It is more acceptable for women to seek help online however, there is less support for men. By researching further into the impacts social media has on men\u2019s self worth, it can enable men to feel more comfortable when facing these issues. The research can aid understanding of this and also result in this topic becoming less taboo, giving a better chance for men to talk freely about their experiences.<nl><nl>I have investigated men\u2019s self worth in the context of social media and my main research question is \u2018How do young men talk about self worth within the context of social media (18-25)?\u2019. My method of analysis is discourse analysis as it allows for in-depth analysis into not only my participant\u2019s language use to construct ideas but also intonation. The interview will take place over a \u2018Zoom\u2019 video call, therefore I am able to have a video recording of all my participants' answers. <nl><nl>AnalysisResults<nl><nl>Through annotating my transcript I was able to select prominent themes that were discussed by my participant in the interview. These themes are spoken of throughout the interview and appear multiple times, even in different questions. From my initial question (line 7) I was able to determine that my participant is an avid user of social media, using it for entertainment purposes as well as using various platforms. This ensures that the questions I ask are relevant to my participant and the answers reflect their social media usage. <nl><nl>Key themes that were discussed by my participant include \"the ideal man\", involving image, appearance and social status; also \"alternate reality\", discussing not only the falseness of social media but also the construction of one's image on social media platforms.<nl><nl>The Ideal Man<nl><nl>The idea of \u2018the ideal man\u2019 featured within my participants answers multiple times, with a construction of what they personally believe to be the ideal man. As opposed to referring to what my participant feels they should look like, my participant instead suggests what others \"should be looking for\" (line 174) in a man, for example, the ideal height \"6 foot 4, or over 6 foot\" (line 175),  the ideal body, having \"six packs\" (line 138), adequate facial hair \"beard\" (line 176) etc. This is a very specific portrayal of men, suggesting that this is a common image for men to hold and strive to achieve. Although men do have an idea of what the ideal body type is they are also aware that in general life, this may not always be the case, with my participant stating that \"It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of me. It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of anyone I know.\" (line 162-163) when asked if he felt represented by men on social media. However, despite this acknowledgement, my participant still felt uncomfortable for comparisons between the appearance of men on social media and himself. My participant used the phrase \"I\u2019d prefer just to leave it at that\" (lines 161 and 294) indicating that men do feel uncomfortable about discussing their appearance, which supports the taboo of men expressing self-doubt and lacking self worth and lowered confidence. This would explain why my participant referred to other people he knows whenever talking about personal appearance, in order to make his answer generalised as opposed to solely him as well as deflect the discomfort about the fact that he is not the ideal man by justifying it with the fact that most people do not look like that. This is supported when he says \"I don\u2019t think many men would want to admit, especially among their peers, wouldn\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re not the ideal person.\" (lines 354-355) <nl><nl>In addition to the body image, a man\u2019s social status and financial status also seems to be prevalent when it comes to describing the \u2018ideal man\u2019 with my participant referring to men with \"seven figures\" (line 138), and men who have \"lavish\" (line 81 ) lifestyles. A given example was the actor and influencer \u2018Dan Bilzerian\u2019; well known for \"constantly flaunting a bunch of money\" (line 241) and \"constantly surrounded by money\". (line 242) This was someone who my participant would refer to as a \u2018role model\u2019 for most males. My participant also referred to the fact that \"men can be successful on social media without looking the greatest\" (line 225), due to their social and financial status. This is supported by the evolutionary psychology theory that women will desire men who are able to provide stability, in the forms of shelter, money, food etc. (Li, Li, Chan &amp; Zhang, 2016). This would explain that now in the digital age, men are able to attract attention with their wealth via social media through posting \"lavish\" (line 81) objects. As it is now commonplace for influencers to be posting this type of content, as my participant stated, \"ordinary people might look at that and think \u2018Well, that\u2019s not me\u2019.\"(line  So this becomes the new goals and the new norm. It is evident that the fact that my participant did not relate to these standards, as when asked if he felt represented by these role models and depictions of men he stated \"No. No. No. No I don\u2019t.\" (line 156) Being unable to relate to the norm often results in incongruence between one's actual self and ideal self which may lower self worth. (Rogers, 1959).<nl><nl>My participant states that they have changed themselves in order to conform with these standards, however wished not to elaborate on how he changed. Instead he referred to people that he knew of, talking about there being  \"a lot of men that will spend a bunch of time at the gym to try and achieve the body that every man wants.\" (lines 347-348) This emphasises that the pressures displayed online and on social media affects men enough for them to wish to change their lifestyle in order to relate to these standards. <nl><nl>Alternate Reality<nl><nl>Throughout my participants answers he refers to the fact that social media is \"not a true depiction\" (line 60) , is a \"very, very fake place\" (lines 104, 71, 63), \"is quite a negative place\" (lines 70, 84) , is \"not real\" (line 107) , is \"very unhealthy\" (line 117), has \"bad sides\" (line 123), is \"the furthest thing from real life\" (lines 147-148) etc. This is common in all the answers, and is said in multiple different ways. My participant referred to social media in very negative ways, and suggested it is a \"toxic\" (line 136) place, despite spending around \"5 hours\" (line 15) per day. This is not an uncommon amount of time on social media, however spending this much time surrounded by something that is perceived as negative by my participant, it is unsurprising that his self confidence is impacted. Also, despite this awareness of the fact that not everything is quite what it seems on social media, the standards are still internalised. This suggests that regardless of the reality or the accuracy of the things that one may be exposed to, they are still accepted by people and becomes the societal norm. My participant also refers to the fact that women are more educated about the ways images are distorted online as opposed to enhancements and photoshop for men.  <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl><nl>From my research, it is evident that despite being aware of the falseness and unrealistic standards of social media, it is evident that young men\u2019s self worth is impacted negatively by the content they are exposed to on social media. Despite being adamant that they are aware of the one sidedness of social media, men continue to make comparisons and draw from this to bring into real life situations. This makes it clear that men experience lowered self confidence not only looks wise but also based on their financial status, social status and more materialistic things. My research has also made it clear that men also feel pressure, and more should be done in terms of support for men online. However, regardless of the gender, social media does tend to display only positive events, making it harder for regular people to accept other events and negative things in real life.", "To whom this may concern,<nl><nl>My name is <part_FN_SN> and I\u2019m a student on the course of <course>.<nl><nl>Following the results release the link for my results has been removed from my <system>.<nl>I was trying to access it to see the next steps I need to take as it has information of deferred modules and referred modules.<nl><nl>Could you please re instate the link on my <system> or assist with me the deffered examination dates and other such information.<nl><nl>Hope to hear from you soon.<nl><nl>Kind regards,<nl><nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hi <addr1_NN>, <nl>There are reading lists that are given to you for each module - so dependant on what modules you picked and if they are some of the ones I did, I could potentially give you a head start and send you the corresponding reading lists.

Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state.", "Favourite cuisine. Erm, I'm not really sure I have one but, mm, I\u2019ve recently got into, erm, Chinese food recently, recently. But erm, what\u2019s my favourite cuisine? I don\u2019t really have one, I\u2019ll just I like a mixture of things.<new>Erm, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just quite different and it\u2019s not the typical, erm, yeah, potatoes or steak or fries or whatever. It\u2019s just a different sort of, like a whole different country, different culture, different taste, different flavours. So, but, erm, something like dumplings, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have it on a normal day in your house. So, if I had that. And then yeah, you could go to the basic stuff like, er, egg fried rice or chicken fried rice, king prawn fried rice but, yeah, just different culture, I\u2019d say.<new>Oh, my favourite dish to cook. Erm, I mean, I can cook but I wouldn\u2019t say I'm the  <chef>  of the house  <laugh> . So, there\u2019s not much of a, a range to pick from. But erm, I would say, I can make my own roasts quite well, actually, er.<new>Yeah.<new><laugh> , okay. So, erm, it starts by getting your King Edward potatoes in. They usually have a bit of a red tint to them on the outside. So, then you just wash the potatoes, peel them, er, put a bit of salt, a bit of herbs on them, you know, cut them up, er, mix it all together. Then that\u2019s the potatoes done. And a trick my mum taught me is that you can boil the potatoes for a bit before you put them in the oven, which makes them all fluffy and actually cooks them quicker. So yeah, you season it all up and then I actually boil it. Then you put it into the oven and then that\u2019s the potatoes done. Then you get the sausages out of the pack, er, place it on a tray on the foil, put it inside the oven. Then the gravy, it\u2019s, it looks simple but it\u2019s actually kind of hard to make because if you get it too thick, like you\u2019re just eating slob. And if it\u2019s too thin, it\u2019s just water. So, you\u2019ve just got to, as you\u2019re pouring in the hot water, pour in the gra-, the granules at the same time and mix it consistently, otherwise, if you get lumps or it gets all thin, it\u2019s not really going to taste the best. So, whilst you\u2019re doing all of that, the ovens and the sausages are inside. So, erm, really and truly, when you\u2019re making the gravy, you\u2019re practically done. And then, obviously, you\u2019re boiling up all the carrots, the broccolis and then you plate up and you\u2019re done."]}

Due to contralateral processing, P3 should remain inattentive when shown a stimuli on the left. By using EEG, alpha activity can be recorded when shown a stimuli cued left or cued right. Event markers allow for it to be clear when the participant is shown the stimuli, and the alpha activity was recorded. The results showed that there was a significantly higher in left than right cue condition, and supported the hypothesis.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha activity refers to electrical impulses oscillating at 8-13Hz , this is an alpha wave. These brain waves begin in the cerebral cortex (Moini &amp; Piran, 2020) and occur during periods of inattention, where one is in a restful state, whilst being awake, examples of this is when closing eyes, meditating (Lagopoulos et al., 2009), daydreaming etc.  When the brain begins to focus on stimuli, alpha waves are suppressed. The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007), proposes that high alpha indicates disengagement and inhibition of task irrelevant brain areas. In task relevant brain areas, alpha remains low, supporting that alpha activity is modulated by attention.  <nl><nl>This hypothesis is supported by Magosso et al, 2019, which used a regular setting and a VR (virtual reality) setting to see if the intensity of the task and the levels of attention required affects alpha frequency. The results showed that alpha signals are suppressed when having to give attention to tasks although it seems that when isolated from all external features (when participating in VR) alpha activity becomes greater. This suggests that it is the modulation and diversion of attention which causes changes in alpha frequencies.<nl><nl>Sauseng et al (2005) presented participants with directional cues indicating which hemifield the target stimuli would appear in. The target stimuli consisted of either small or large bars which participants identified and responded with \u2018s\u2019 for small and \u2018l\u2019 for large. Results showed that there was stronger alpha frequency suppression in brain areas contralateral to the targeted hemifield. This is due to visual stimuli being processed contralaterally. 200ms before the stimuli was presented, in active processing areas like the parietal lobe (P3), the alpha range is also lower. This study is supportive of AIM (Klimesch et al, 2007), and is used as the basis for this experiment, as it is a partial replication. In this experiment, the focus will be on the effect of arrow cues, specifically the direction they are facing.<nl><nl>Hypothesis<nl>As AIH states, alpha range activity is present in areas that are uninvolved in active processing and is suppressed in areas that actively process. By directing attention, and cueing the participant to expect the stimuli in a specific region they will begin paying attention. As shown by Sauseng et al (2005), visual stimuli is processed contralaterally resulting in alpha suppression in the other side of the brain. For example, if the stimuli is present in the left visual field it will be processed by the right hemisphere. By using the left parietal cortex (P3) to record alpha activity, it is expected that alpha activity will be greater when a stimulus is shown on the left and for this activity to be suppressed when the stimuli is on the right.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 undergraduate students were participants chosen from an opportunity sample.<nl><nl>Design<nl>This experiment uses a within subjects design. The dependent variable is the alpha range amplitudes (microvolts) on the left hand side of the parietal lobe (P3). The independent variable is the direction of the arrow cue, with two levels, left or right. <nl>Materials<nl>This experiment used a Biopac MP36 to collect data, EEG electrodes, AC Cream, Abrasive paste, PsychoPy to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device and stimuli (see figure 1). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG by opening the Biopac student lab. From the \u2018analog\u2019 tab select Electroencaphagram (EEG)\u2019 \u20180.5-100Hz wnotch\u2019, so the 50Hz band is filtered out. Digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker.. The \u2018calculation\u2019 tab allowed alpha frequency to be recorded. Then select \u2018EEG alpha 8-13Hz\u2019 from the drop down list. The sampling rate was 1000Hz. The participant was then prepared to be attached to the EEG. The electrode sites were abraded with everi cream using a cotton bud, and then AC cream was put on the electrodes. The electrodes are placed using the 1020 system. The active electrode was placed on P3. Participants were then given a cued visual task. A fixation cross was cued at the centre of the screen for 34ms, followed by an arrow indicating where to focus attention, with a 50% chance of it being cued left or right. There was then an interval of 600-800ms followed by a fixation cross for the second time, finally the participant was shown the target stimuli for 50ms, either a large or small white bar against a black background. Participants were then asked to use the keyboard to respond to the stimuli, typing either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. 75% of the trials were valid (the target stimuli was presented in the same hemifield that the arrow cue indicated), and 25% were invalid (the target stimuli was presented in the other hemifield). There were 20 blocks of the four trial types (cue left with a small bar, cue right with a small bar, cue left with a large bar and cue right with a large bar) so in total there were 80 trials.<nl><nl>Results<nl>There were transformations applied to the raw 9-13Hz alpha EEG data. There were eventmarkers received by PsychoPy through the Stimtracker, in order to identify when the stimuli was presented to the participants. The data also was used to specifically analyse from 200ms prior to stimulus onset after the directional arrow cues had been shown. Furthermore, the data was rectified, making negative values positive despite them showing excitatory or inhibitory activity. The samples were also averaged in order to limit the impact that outlying values would have on the data. This data is referred to as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl><nl>Descriptive Statistics<nl><table><nl><nl>Inferential Statistics <nl>The wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T=566, n=38, p=.002).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results of this experiment show that there was a significantly higher level of alpha activity when the stimulus was shown on the left hand side, this fit the original hypothesis. These results are consistent with AIH (Klimesch et al, 2007) as it shows that when participants are given a stimulus in their left hemifield, due to contralateral processing, this is processed by the right part of brain areas. As we were looking at P3, the left side of the parietal lobe, when shown a cue on the left it was processed on the right, meaning the left was task irrelevant and inattentive, resulting in higher alpha activity.<nl><nl>Methodological Problems<nl>Factors which may have confounded data include artefacts, which is when the EEG is contaminated by excess movement. When eye movements take place, the electrical activity could be recorded as brain activity. Eye movements could be blinking or horizontal eye movement, especially when having to look at either side of the screen. Blinking could also pose other issues such as the participant missing the cue. However, it does not seem to be too much of an issue and repetition and more trials would minimise the effects of this.<nl>Another issue could be the laboratory setting, as this could have an affect on brain activity. This is not a very normal situation for participants to be placed in so they may be uncomfortable or more alert as they know they are being studied. This could impact the EEG recordings as it is not a life-like situation so the results may not be generalisable to the whole population.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Overall, the data is valid despite minor methodological issues, which after replication can minimise the effect of individual differences, such as blinking and horizontal eye movement. The data also supports AIH and produced the expected results.", "So, in the first picture, there\u2019s two women against a white background. There\u2019s one woman standing and one woman sitting.

I wish I could go vegan. I, w-, I genuinely wish I had to the willpower. I think I did try once but there are just not many alternatives that taste the same as cheese. But when it comes to like dairy free chocolate and stuff like, we\u2019re trying. I know my sister\u2019s new year\u2019s resolution is to go vegan for the year. So, I\u2019m the only one my hou-, my dad and I are the only people in the household that eat meat. So, my mum and my sister\u2019s vegetarian. So, it just mean my whole life I have not eaten meat.

I also think going vegan is extremely expensive like we were looking at, erm, alternatives. So, I don\u2019t drink milk, I only drink soya milk. And although, actually, it\u2019s gotten a lot cheaper, other vegan alternatives are just, they\u2019re so expensive.

I think right now I\u2019ll stick to like food that we do eat now but yeah, I\u2019m quite happy being a vegetarian, like  <unintelligible> . The, ger-, the weird thing, actually, you know the first lockdown, it was from March until about August, I think and some restaurants and stuff opened. I, my grandparents were around and they\u2019re from India, but I didn\u2019t eat any meat from March to August. And when I went out for the first time, I ate a lot of meat. My body ended up rejecting all of it. So, I felt s-sick and it, I know it was so bad. I had  <unintelligible> , I was throwing up everywhere, I couldn\u2019t move, like I had to crawl down the stairs and like in tears, like  <unintelligible> , just so I could like  <unintelligible>  scream to get my parents\u2019 attention. Yeah, my body rejected it all. So, like after that, my parents were like, \"Okay, small amount of meat and do it slowly.\" And ever since then, I get really scared that if I have  <unintelligible> . That\u2019s why I think right now  <unintelligible>  open, I try and eat meat maybe once a week so my body doesn\u2019t get to what it did last year because yeah, oh, that was awful.

If not, it is fine. <nl><nl>I do apologise deeply for the inconvenience that this has caused. <new>I can do any day in the evenings and <day> any time.

{"id": "f97aae83-cedf-4a72-84aa-1d955e86246205243", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["The Modern State is seen to have five key features: sovereignty, public institutions, territorial association, legitimation and domination (D\u2019Amato, 2018). These characteristics can be highlighted as territory (an area with defined borders), external and internal sovereignty where a state must be able to defend its territory and not be too dependent on another power. A state achieves sovereignty when it is recognised by the family of states as the \u2018sole governing authority within its territory and as the legal equal of other states\u2019 (The Modern State, 2020). Furthermore, there has to be legitimacy in which there is recognised rule, examples of this are traditional legitimacy, charismatic legitimacy and rational-legal legitimacy; the legitimacy enhances a state\u2019s sovereignty at a lower cost. The last characteristic is modern bureaucracy, this is required to generate as well as collect revenue. In this essay we will be discussing and critically examining Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli, who criticizes the moralistic view of authority. Machiavelli although seen as an evil man, had a large influence on the future of modern civilisation especially in comparison to the artists of his time. <nl><nl>For Machiavelli, moral basis on which to judge the difference between illegitimate and legitimate uses of power does not exist, arguing that this does not add to the actual possession of power \u2013 rather the legitimacy rests upon the threat of coercive force. His beliefs rest in those that the leaders should avoid the common values of justice and mercy in preference to the use of violence and fear, particularly if it is in the best interest such as through gaining and expanding political power. Historians have stated Machiavelli to be the \u2018teacher of evil\u2019 such as Leo Strauss (McShea, 1963). However, Machiavelli has been credited with formulating the \"modern concept of the state\", that is understood in the Weberian sense of a \u2018form of rule possessing a monopoly of coercive authority within a set territorial boundary\u2019 (Nederman, 2019). Machiavelli derived his views from the experience of the Caesura Borgia.  However, Machiavelli did contribute to the way we understand the modern state now as he proposed his own conception of the \"civil principality\" whilst subverting his previous medieval idea of state as regime (Sellers,2015). However, it should be noted that force is not the only weapon to rule the people so his argument can be seen as psychologically weak.<nl><nl>Machiavelli also states that principality can be seen to be governed by a single ruler and is helped by anointed ministers which is the case in many current states seen today. Machiavelli states that the idea of taking over depends on the character of region than the character of the prince, he has the strong belief that the citizens will recollect and fight for their liberty. Although we have grown out of medieval brutality, it can be argued that the modern-day equivalent of killing is to send rivals to jail or allow opponents to lose if there is indecisiveness. An example of this is Brexit, where the Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn was seen as indecisive and therefore could not gain enough votes in time for the referendum. Another way Machiavelli is modernised is through the idea that leaders will need to make severe decisions, such as through firing a member of the cabinet. An example of this is the Night of Long Knives in 1962 where Macmillan sacked a third of his cabinet. Nevertheless, Machiavelli ignored individualism and had one sided views of human nature which can be viewed as a critical flaw.<nl><nl>For Machiavelli, law is also impossible to follow without the required military as arms are a requirement in order for leaders to establish great frameworks. Although it can be criticised as we do not follow medieval combat, there are still some aspects which apply to the modern state, for instance the concept that an army from your own principality is most beneficial for defending yourself \u2013 and this concept is universally accepted. Machiavelli also made the point that there is conflict of interest which can be seen in the modern state also, for example through the leak of the Panama papers. What is also seen in the modern state is Machiavelli\u2019s view on auxiliary troops being faithful to someone else, for example through the rise of the Taliban, as although it was intended for the Taliban to fight the Soviet Union, they later turned and became the lead terrorist group. In Antonio Negri\u2019s view, Machiavelli belongs to a \u2018political alternative of modern thought grounded on a revolutionary version of constituent power\u2019 (Negri and Maurizia Boscagli, 2009). However, Quentin Skinner and J.G.A Pocock write that we should regard Machiavelli as part of the republican tradition, i.e. as part of the living legacy of Aristotelian philosophy (Roecklein, 2012). Nonetheless, Machiavelli was the first modern thinker to have thought of the State as an independent entity and not recognising any religious organisation exterior to it and The Prince has been a choice of several political leaders such as Louis XIV, Napoleon Bonaparte and Benito Mussolini. <nl><nl>The modern state was \u2018constituted by an abstraction from personal to impersonal rule\u2019 (Mansfield, 1983). With Machiavelli we encounter a challenge to the classical regime which is expressed in his use of stato (his stato is someone\u2019s to acquire), whereas for Aristotle\u2019s regime there is some ordering of the inhabitants of the city. The central theme of Machiavelli\u2019s political ideas is power with absolute state being the end. The state is viewed as superior to all associations and is sovereign as well as autonomous however he also stated that religion cannot influence politics and the church cannot control the state, which is not the case. <nl><nl>Comparing Machiavelli to other theorists allows for us to critically evaluate him further. Plato had the vision of every human being born into a division which was maintained and creating an arrangement for the state in the course of classism whereas Machiavelli proposed with the aim of sovereignty to support the nation in which the leader controls and protects its citizens. Machiavelli\u2019s concept of virt\u00fa highlights the utilitarian needs of the country. For Machiavelli virt\u00fa outweighs virtue in times of need whilst Plato believes a \u2018just ruler must behave the same at all times\u2019 however we have to consider they were writing in different eras, as Plato\u2019s philosophy is based on utopian principles and Machiavelli is viewed as a realist (Abrams, M, 2017). Aristotle divides government into two categories: good and bad with good forms fall aristocracy and under bad fall oligarchy. Aristotle wanted to help society achieve goodness through politics whereas on the other hand Machiavelli sought to achieve the maintenance of power and stability. They have differing views in terms of Aristotle claimed that if an entire state is made to fear their ruler, this would cause unhappiness however Machiavelli suggested that it is better to be feared than loved as it creates balance. However, they are on similar sides when it comes to liberation, as in the Prince it stated such ruler should not dictate the actions of others, but all together Machiavelli was seeking a practical type of politics whilst Aristotle took a rather idealistic approach (Tabone, 2020).  <nl><nl>Hobbes and Machiavelli have fascinating ideas on human nature impacting the state as the common theme is the usage of fear, meaning power needs to be acquired and maintained but we have to remember that Machiavelli\u2019s time period involved the peak of absolutism and hierarchies. Philosophers such a John Locke have directly opposing views on government. Locke\u2019s perception of revolt as a right gave people excessive power compared to the government, this did not exist during the time of Machiavelli. Locke believed in the idea of the government working for the people, however this is directly opposed to Machiavelli\u2019s thought that the ruler should do what it takes to remain in power (Chris Joseph, 2014). Machiavelli recommended that coercion should be used in order to govern whereas Locke favoured a social contract with the concept of dual accountability. Although Machiavelli\u2019s concept of coercion is flawed, he did recognise that rulers could not govern by this alone and advocated for the use of cunning and subterfuge, Locke\u2019s social contract did not contain an element of this. Machiavelli had a pessimistic view of individuals and believed human beings are fundamentally bad whereas Locke was more optimistic. In the modern state it follows Machiavelli\u2019s model more as the rulers in the modern state are comprised of the rich and powerful in society. Mill and Machiavelli also have the same solution to government in freedom of speech, they are both aware that people cannot have a hand in ruling itself. <nl><nl>Political leaders and their followers believed that Machiavellism was a disease infesting the politic body. He is still regarded with a negative reputation, but he still aids us to understand the modern state. Machiavelli promoted the central role of a citizen in preserving institutions which is reflected through the meaning of the Second Amendment in the U.S. Constitution (Bernard, 2009). Among modern believers of Machiavelli, there are Burmese generals such as Web Jiabao, the Former Premier of China and Lord Mandelson (Bernard, 2009). Machiavelli and Pareto agree in terms of this where they say egotism or selfishness as a natural property of the human species (Femia, 2013). According to Machiavellism though, the principle aim of prince is the unification as well as welfare of the state which showed reality of practical politics. He deduced that the internal unity and powerful government were the essential of any state by observing the affairs of the interstate rivalries. The sole aim of the prince is also to increase power in ways such as to be an expert in managing and organising a war- power is seen as the only reason of the state. <nl><nl>To conclude Machiavelli contributes to the \u2018comprehension of constituent power as a living force within social order\u2019 (Lucchese, 2016). He developed a revolutionary position, suggesting that political conflict is not a destabilising factor, but rather the grounding force of free republics. His concepts and ideas are often misunderstood as he displayed rare intellect to become a partisan in an age where absolute monarchy held control (Mathur, 1991). All together Machiavelli was the first thinker who justified secular state and the first advocate for autonomy for the state. He unfairly became associated with evil through his critical work written about The Prince, and although it did not get translated until almost a hundred years later the negative view about Machiavelli had already been established into Elizabethan England. All together he communicated priority to the state and put it above morality and religion as it is the highest form of social organisation and most essential to promote human welfare, and this is seen clearly in the modern state. Machiavelli\u2019s Prince dealt exclusively with the interests of a single person of power that focuses on only the leader\u2019s welfare in mind whereas the theories of Plato, Aristotle, Locke and Mill dealt with the welfare of society. However, in the modern state there Machiavelli did consider that the Prince needed to maintain good relations with the people which is what we observe. It can be agreed the way that Machiavelli talks about the state as Machiavelli was a realist.", "For the most recent armpit I used google chrome. <nl><nl>My <system> just doesn\u2019t seem to work and I\u2019ve been trying to submit it and that\u2019s why I sent it as an attachment in an email to <group> as I\u2019ve no other way of submitting this very important work<nl><new><nl>Yh that\u2019s fine. <nl>What time you lot tryna meet up and where ? <new>Nah just meet up after<new>Yh that\u2019s fine <nl>Make a gc and add my number so I know exactly where to meet you<nl><nl><phone_number><new>Afternoon, <nl> <nl>My name is <part_FN_SN> and I live in <building> \u2013 Floor <floor_number>, Flat <house_number1>, Room <house_number2>.<nl>My booking Id is : <id_number><nl> <nl>I\u2019m sending this email to officially inform you of my cancellation of my tenancy.<nl> <nl>As this return of room goes against my original plans, would it be possible to keep my belongings in the room until the official return of room date : <DDth> <month> <YYYY>?<nl> <nl>Hope to hear from you soon. <nl> <nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hi <addr4_FN>,<nl> <nl>Sorry for sending it so late.<nl> <nl>If you could just read over it, edit it and add it onto the poster as you see fit.

Erm, one woman\u2019s wearing a striped black and white tee shirt with black jeans and one\u2019s wearing a denim jacket. One of them seems to be laughing and is looking at someone else, whereas one of them is looking down. The woman standing is the one wearing the striped tee shirt. She\u2019s also got blonde hair and seems to be involved in something. She looks busy. The other woman has braids and she seems to be engaged in conversation with someone and is laughing. The second image has two men. One of them is wearing a t-s-, checked shirt and the other is wearing a floral tee shirt. The one wearing the floral tee shirt is looking at the man wearing the stripe, er, the checked shirt. The one wearing the checked shirt is looking at a laptop. The laptop is a MacBook and it\u2019s on a table. The background is spotty. Erm, the background is spotty. The laptop is on the table. They seem like they\u2019re doing some type of work but nothing too stressful because the one in the shirt is smiling and so is the one in the tee shirt. In the third image, two people are sitting next to each other. One\u2019s a woman and one\u2019s a man. They\u2019re both wearing jackets. The woman\u2019s wearing a bl-black leather jacket with a black tee shirt and red jeans with some boots. The man\u2019s wearing a grey jacket with a green tee shirt and brown trousers. The man is holding a book and they\u2019re both looking at the same person. You can see the person\u2019s hand in the corner.

There is one Black lady with braids, and one white lady with brown to blonde ombr\u00e9 hair. They look like they\u2019re in a work environment, as they\u2019re dressed fairly professionally. It looks as though the Black lady is- still she\u2019s sat down, and the white lady is stood up, possibly on a laptop. And they look, the Black lady looks surprised, so the white lady could be helping her with some work or something, and she looks shocked and surprised, but they both look happy and smiling.

And the Black lady who was sat down is wearing a long sleeve black top and a blue denim jacket. So that\u2019s the first picture. So on to the second picture. There\u2019s a picture of two males, one white and one Asian. So there is a white background but they seem to be sat on a black sofa with green, with a green circle pattern on it. The, erm, Asian boy is looking at a white Apple Mac laptop, and the white boy is looking at the Asian boy. Erm, the white boy is wearing a blue floral t-shirt, and the Asian boy is wearing a white crew neck top with a black and red shirt over the top. The laptop is sat on a circular wooden table. Erm, on to the third picture. So there is a Black lady and an Asian male who are both sat down in front of a low glass table. The background is quite interesting; black with, erm, some dot- with some white dots in a circular pattern. So the Black lady ha- is wearing a black top with a black leather jacket, burgundy trousers and brown boots. The Asian boy is wearing a green t-shirt with a grey and black coat. He is holding an open book and he\u2019s wearing beige bottoms with black trainers. They are both looking to the side and they both have a happy expression on their face. You can see someone else\u2019s hands in the picture, to the side that they\u2019re looking. Erm, so it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s another person in the picture, that they are speaking to; possibly like an interview or something. Yep. That is all three pictures."]}

One is sat down wearing a denim jacket, and she has twists in her hair. The other woman is wearing a black and white stripey top, dark blue jeans and a belt. So number one consists of the lady in the denim jacket sitting down, she\u2019s staring at something and her mouth is wide open. She has quite a surprised, but in a positive way, erm, her facial feature shows that she is looking at something which is surprising. And the other lady, on the right of her, is looking downwards towards something. Erm, also the lady with the black and white stripey top has medium length hair, is quite fair skinned, has dark brown hair going into more of an ombr\u00e9 blonde. Whereas the other lady sat down is, she is a Black lady, with black twists. Also, by the picture, it looks like the lady in the black and white top is showing er, her friend next to her, they look like they know each other. And yeah, they look like they\u2019re friends. They look like they are s- in some sort of maybe school environment. It\u2019s a casual environment, which is seen by the clothes that they are wearing. Another way this picture can also be seen is the lady in the denim jacket is looking, n-not looking at something that the girl in the black and white top is showing her, she\u2019s actually looking at something else, and that she\u2019s surprised by what she\u2019s seen because her mouth is wide open. In the second picture, it looks like erm, there are two boys in this picture. One is of South Asian descent, has short black hair and is wearing a black and red chequered shirt with a white top underneath, and there\u2019s a boy next to him on the, his left. And he\u2019s quite fair skinned, has a black ear piercing, and has short brown hair. He\u2019s wearing a top which consists of black and white flowers with red writing on top, but you can\u2019t read the writing. And the guy in the black and red sweatshirt is staring at a MacBook Air, and, er, looks really interested in what he is reading. Whereas his friend next to him is either staring at him, or there is something that\u2019s distracted him that\u2019s next to the guy in the black and red sweatshirt. From the looks of it, because of how close they are, they look like friends. And they look like university students, or a little bit older. They, yeah, they look around the age of between eighteen to er twenty-two. Yeah. In the background actually there are light green and dark green spots, with a black background, which looks like either a wallpaper or it looks like they\u2019re sitting down on a sofa which has that background. And the table that the MacBook is on is a wooden table with different shades of brown, giving it that timber sort of effect. Yeah. In the third picture, there is a Black female and on her left is a South Asian male. South Asian male has a beard and almost a buzz cut which has grown out. And he is wearing a dark green shirt with a long black coat that has buttons on the side, and also a long collar with beige trousers, dark beige trousers, and he is wearing black trainers. In the background of these two people there is a sort of spiral, almost hypnotising effect, sort of wallpaper. Which is, consists of many small, round, white circles across a black backdrop. The girl is wearing a black top with a black leather jacket, and is holding something in her hand, which I can\u2019t see it. Oh, she\u2019s holding something and it looks like there is also a hand in the picture, next to both of her hands. She\u2019s also wearing dark maroon leggings, with light brown leather boots. There is a table in front of them which has something on the glass table, which consists of either leaflets or pamphlets. And yeah, the male is also holding a book which he\u2019s gone through about, I\u2019d say, fifty per cent of. He looks like he\u2019s in the middle of the book; he looks like he\u2019s about to turn a page. They both are staring at the same thing, it looks like, because their eyes are in the same direction. They are both smiling. Erm, you can tell they\u2019re both quite comfortable with each other because of how close they are sat to each other. It looks like they are almost friends. It also looks like they may be students as well, because that looks like quite a big book. So yeah, number three has, you can tell they\u2019re both looking at something which makes them happy, or is something that is amusing to them. Because neither of them look confused. I-I think they both look eager to know more."]}

It would have to be  <restaurant1> , which is near, a restaurant, a Thai restaurant near where I live. We went there for my dad\u2019s fiftieth when restaurants were open. And my favourite dish there, they do these lamb skewers erm, but with a like a honey sauce that I didn\u2019t think the two originally went good together but I had to order like  <unintelligible>  of those starters, it was really bad.

It looks as though the Black lady is- still she\u2019s sat down, and the white lady is stood up, possibly on a laptop. And they look, the Black lady looks surprised, so the white lady could be helping her with some work or something, and she looks shocked and surprised, but they both look happy and smiling.

And the Black lady who was sat down is wearing a long sleeve black top and a blue denim jacket. So that\u2019s the first picture. So on to the second picture. There\u2019s a picture of two males, one white and one Asian. So there is a white background but they seem to be sat on a black sofa with green, with a green circle pattern on it. The, erm, Asian boy is looking at a white Apple Mac laptop, and the white boy is looking at the Asian boy. Erm, the white boy is wearing a blue floral t-shirt, and the Asian boy is wearing a white crew neck top with a black and red shirt over the top. The laptop is sat on a circular wooden table. Erm, on to the third picture. So there is a Black lady and an Asian male who are both sat down in front of a low glass table. The background is quite interesting; black with, erm, some dot- with some white dots in a circular pattern. So the Black lady ha- is wearing a black top with a black leather jacket, burgundy trousers and brown boots. The Asian boy is wearing a green t-shirt with a grey and black coat. He is holding an open book and he\u2019s wearing beige bottoms with black trainers. They are both looking to the side and they both have a happy expression on their face. You can see someone else\u2019s hands in the picture, to the side that they\u2019re looking.

Let me kn<new>Hi, <nl><nl>Is it possible to reschedule my slot as a family emergency has occurred and it means I\u2019m currently unavailable for the session. <nl><nl>Hope to hear from you soon. <nl><nl><part_FN_SN><new>Hi,<nl><nl>My name is <part_FN_SN> and I\u2019m one of the 3 tenants who currently live at <house_number> <road>, <city>, <postcode>. I'm writing this email on behalf of us all in regards to the maintenance of the house.<nl><nl>Firstly, the fridge has been a recurring problem. This is because from day one it has always been difficult to fully close it - partly due to the design of the cupboard door and the fact that the freezer isn\u2019t working properly and as a result the ice builds up and doesn\u2019t allow it to close. This further prevents the fridge from closing properly in addition to the cupboard design door. This ongoing issue has resulted in numerous amounts of food not being kept properly and the unfortunate throwing away of them. We are all experiencing hard times as we attempt to continue living with COVID19, therefore the continuous cycle of buying food and it going off due to a dysfucntional and ineffective fridge makes these times just that much harder.<nl><nl>A contractor was sent out once and the service he provided was not good enough as this is still a very important issue - if not the most important as it directly effects our health and safety.<nl><nl>Another issue in the kitchen is that one of the lower cabinet doors has come off. I believe the inside components have snapped and the repair will require new parts.<nl><nl>The last of the issues in the kitchen is the metal wall section behind the sink. The bottom part of it has opened and essentially began to peel off. This also needs to be fixed because if its allowed to continue peeling the wall behind it will start to get wet from the sink and cause further damage to the property.<nl><nl>In line with maintenance requests, it has also been brought to my attention that the top floor tenant is extremely unhappy with the mattress she is having to use as she says all she can feel is the springs within it. This causes severe joint and shoulder pain - again this is important as it has a direct impact on her health. If this could be replaced it would be most helpful, as we are timely paying tenants who don\u2019t believe this to be an unjust request.<nl><nl>I did contact the <business> property management mobile contact number ending 152, I was directed to report all maintenance issues through property file. However, we were not given access to this platform and so can\u2019t use it. I did reply and let the person know this but I received no reply to that message and the maintenance issues are still outstanding.<nl><nl>I look forward to what solutions you are able to offer and hope to hear from you soon.<nl><nl><part_FN_SN>"]}

So, I snack quite a bit more than actually cooking and eating, cooking and eating four meals, like I should be doing.

{"id": "6f7f45b0-43c8-4e06-aebb-0c7bd9fcbfd102865", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>What is religion? Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961). This definition further criticizes religion as something which individuals turn to out of worry and desperation.<nl>In addition to the functional definitions of religion which can be seen above, there is also the substantive definition of religion which can be investigated. Substantive definitions tend to define religion in terms of its content rather than its function. Here, it is common for the existence of a \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018supernatural being\u2019 to be present when defining religion. This can be seen in Roland Robertsons definition of religion, where he states that \u2018religion refers to the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life\u2019 (Robertson, 1970). Such definitions however, can be seen as problematic to the wider community. This definition of religion by Robertson, clearly necessitates the existence of a god, and rejects any ideas that do not have a \u2018god\u2019 at the centre of their ideology to be classed as religion. This would not allow for beliefs such as Buddhism to be categorised as a religion, due to the fact that it is not based upon the concept of a creator- God (Gethin, 1998). Robertson\u2019s view on religion is supported by Max Weber, who also uses a substantive concept of religion, seeing it as a belief in a divine entity which cannot be explained scientifically (Weber, 2009). In other words, the belief in a god is required for a concept to be deemed as a religion. Ronald Dworkin however, opposes this notion and states that \u2018religion, does not necessarily mean a belief in god\u2019 and \u2018religion is an interpretive concept\u2019 (Dworkin, 2013). Dworkins use of the word \u2018interpretive\u2019, infers that religion can have a different meaning, dependent on the individual. Buddhism has now been linked to the global category of a world religion (McMahan, 2012), causing much debate upon what constitutes religion. This begs the question, who has set the requirements for what can and cannot be defined as a religion? Who has the right to dictate this? As Aldridge states \u2018Defining religion involves an exercise of power\u2019 (Aldridge, 2007).<nl><nl>Religion in International Relations- Post Secularization and Foreign Policy <nl>Often, when analysing religion within the international relations scene it can be deemed an aspect which is hastily overlooked. Religion is rarely included in most major theories of international relations and this can be ascribed to major Western social thinkers rejecting the notion of religion (Fox and Sandler, 2004), as discussed previously. As a particular scholar illustrated , \u2018the role of religion in explaining attitudes toward issues of international relations is somewhat limited\u2019 (Jelen, 1994). However, when further analysing international relations and conflict, it is clear that religion can be seen as a crucial element which should not be disregarded. It has been said that \u2018Domestic conflicts, including religious conflicts are becoming increasingly international issues\u2019 (Fox and Sandler, 2004). This extract from \u2018Bringing religion into International Relations\u2019, further emphasis the vital role that religion can play when assessing international relations. Examples of conflict which involve religion are The Israel Palestine conflict and the Thirty Years war. Here, religion can be key in resolving and understanding the clash, possibly presenting a recourse. <nl>Post secularization, it has been noted that a global resurgence of religion is transforming our understanding of international relations (Thomas, 2005). As there has been an increase in religious actors, it has recently become a vital analytical focus (Haynes,2005). These religious actors can include examples such as foreign policy taking into account religion, as well as transnational factors. The more that religion begins to play a pivotal role in making country decisions, the more clarity there is on what a substantial role religion plays on the international scene. There has previously been a narrative which has pushed the notion that the term \u2018religion\u2019 carries negative connotations and only leads to tension and ferocity, bringing nothing of substance to the international relations division. This adheres to the \u2018Westphalian presumption\u2019, which holds that \u2018religious and cultural pluralism cannot be accommodated in international public life\u2019 (Thomas, 2005). In other words, faith must be conceived as an internal matter to the sovereign state in order to avoid the risk of potential religious wars. This has encouraged using scientific knowledge and clear reasoning as justification for decisions over religion. It is clear that during these strongly secular times, there wasn\u2019t a want to define the term \u2018religion\u2019 from an international perspective. However, as religion began to make a return to the international scene, events such as 911 and Samuel Huntingtons\u2019 famous \u2018The clash of civilizations?\u2019 thesis (Huntington, 2000), only drew more attention to the importance of religion on the international relations front. As there was deemed to be a rise in religious clash and issues, with pivotal events such as 911, the topic of religion had to be assessed on the international scale. <nl>Many would also agree that religion has an important role to play in creating and shaping beliefs, which may in turn influence the formulation of state policy and foreign policy considerations. An instance of this can be seen with President George W. Bush, where he referred to the US having a \u2018calling\u2019 and \u2018mission\u2019 by the \u2018Maker of heaven\u2019 in his speeches on Foreign Policy (Judis, 2005). Not only can it be inferred here that George Bush is attempting to appeal to his majority audience with his \u2018faithful\u2019 language, but his references to God here explain how religion has had a direct impact on the foreign policy choices made. Bush\u2019s choice of language and rhetoric is extremely influential in shaping perspectives of the US citizens opinions on foreign policy. It was found here that there was a clear link between religion and opinion on U.S foreign policy in the Middle East (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). In particular, Evangelical Christians are more supportive of Bush\u2019s Foreign policy on the Iraq war and his foreign policy in general (Pew Research Centre, 2020). In a specific study carried out by Pew Research Centre, even after adjusting for the identity of the respondents groups, the impact of Evangelical beliefs towards foreign policy towards the Middle East remained statistically important (Pew Research Centre, 2020). These results are significant as they provide confirmatory proof that the position of Evangelical affiliation in shaping public opinion on foreign policy is important. It is also fundamental in understanding what a large effect a single religious group can have on how a country is run. The Middle East and President George Bush are a great area of focus due to the Iraq war being a matter which has concerned wide-spread public opinion since 2003 (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). As Boyer stated \u2018For many believers in biblical prophecy, the Bush administration\u2019s go-it-alone foreign policy, hands-off attitude toward the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and proposed war on Iraq, are not simply actions in the national self-interest or an extension of the war on terrorism, but part of an unfolding divine plan\u2019 (Boyer, 2003). This quote highlights how it is recognised that many individuals feel as though these conflicts directly involve religion and god, not only country policy. This infers that individuals will use faith as a major indicator when deciding their stance on subjects such as the Iraq war and foreign policy. On the contrary, research from the Pew Research centre suggests that people feel as though their faith does not define their opinion on the Iraq War (Different Faiths, Different Messages, 2020). Either way, the fact that there is much debate around religion probes several questions on the topic of faith, making it a valid matter when discussing international relations. As religion is increasingly being used for justification as well as indication, it is an important matter to consider on the international scene. \u00a8<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, when looking at definitions of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the context of both Sociology and International relations, it is obvious that there is much debate around what the word entails and its specific effects on society, good or bad. It is clear however, that religion has played a large role in shaping and moulding the current societies that we live in today, as well as the international relations scene, be it secular or not. Although there may be much debate upon whether the consequences of religion are \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 and \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019, the simple fact that decisions have and are being made based upon this, make it a crucial element that must be taken into consideration when looking at both society and international relations. There is no doubt that further research in the field of religion is vital and needed in order for a wider understanding of religion and its impact in both contexts.", "Hi <addr3_SN>!<nl><nl>Happy new year!

This is because from day one it has always been difficult to fully close it - partly due to the design of the cupboard door and the fact that the freezer isn\u2019t working properly and as a result the ice builds up and doesn\u2019t allow it to close. This further prevents the fridge from closing properly in addition to the cupboard design door. This ongoing issue has resulted in numerous amounts of food not being kept properly and the unfortunate throwing away of them. We are all experiencing hard times as we attempt to continue living with COVID19, therefore the continuous cycle of buying food and it going off due to a dysfucntional and ineffective fridge makes these times just that much harder.<nl><nl>A contractor was sent out once and the service he provided was not good enough as this is still a very important issue - if not the most important as it directly effects our health and safety.<nl><nl>Another issue in the kitchen is that one of the lower cabinet doors has come off.

So, but, erm, something like dumplings, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have it on a normal day in your house. So, if I had that. And then yeah, you could go to the basic stuff like, er, egg fried rice or chicken fried rice, king prawn fried rice but, yeah, just different culture, I\u2019d say.<new>Oh, my favourite dish to cook. Erm, I mean, I can cook but I wouldn\u2019t say I'm the  <chef>  of the house  <laugh> . So, there\u2019s not much of a, a range to pick from. But erm, I would say, I can make my own roasts quite well, actually, er.<new>Yeah.<new><laugh> , okay. So, erm, it starts by getting your King Edward potatoes in. They usually have a bit of a red tint to them on the outside. So, then you just wash the potatoes, peel them, er, put a bit of salt, a bit of herbs on them, you know, cut them up, er, mix it all together. Then that\u2019s the potatoes done. And a trick my mum taught me is that you can boil the potatoes for a bit before you put them in the oven, which makes them all fluffy and actually cooks them quicker. So yeah, you season it all up and then I actually boil it. Then you put it into the oven and then that\u2019s the potatoes done. Then you get the sausages out of the pack, er, place it on a tray on the foil, put it inside the oven. Then the gravy, it\u2019s, it looks simple but it\u2019s actually kind of hard to make because if you get it too thick, like you\u2019re just eating slob. And if it\u2019s too thin, it\u2019s just water. So, you\u2019ve just got to, as you\u2019re pouring in the hot water, pour in the gra-, the granules at the same time and mix it consistently, otherwise, if you get lumps or it gets all thin, it\u2019s not really going to taste the best. So, whilst you\u2019re doing all of that, the ovens and the sausages are inside. So, erm, really and truly, when you\u2019re making the gravy, you\u2019re practically done. And then, obviously, you\u2019re boiling up all the carrots, the broccolis and then you plate up and you\u2019re done.", "Dear <addr5_IN_SN>, <nl><nl>This email is in regards to the languages part of my course.

Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}

Due to contralateral processing, P3 should remain inattentive when shown a stimuli on the left. By using EEG, alpha activity can be recorded when shown a stimuli cued left or cued right. Event markers allow for it to be clear when the participant is shown the stimuli, and the alpha activity was recorded. The results showed that there was a significantly higher in left than right cue condition, and supported the hypothesis.<nl><nl>Introduction<nl>Alpha activity refers to electrical impulses oscillating at 8-13Hz , this is an alpha wave. These brain waves begin in the cerebral cortex (Moini &amp; Piran, 2020) and occur during periods of inattention, where one is in a restful state, whilst being awake, examples of this is when closing eyes, meditating (Lagopoulos et al., 2009), daydreaming etc.  When the brain begins to focus on stimuli, alpha waves are suppressed. The alpha inhibition hypothesis (AIH) (Klimesch et al., 2007), proposes that high alpha indicates disengagement and inhibition of task irrelevant brain areas. In task relevant brain areas, alpha remains low, supporting that alpha activity is modulated by attention.  <nl><nl>This hypothesis is supported by Magosso et al, 2019, which used a regular setting and a VR (virtual reality) setting to see if the intensity of the task and the levels of attention required affects alpha frequency. The results showed that alpha signals are suppressed when having to give attention to tasks although it seems that when isolated from all external features (when participating in VR) alpha activity becomes greater. This suggests that it is the modulation and diversion of attention which causes changes in alpha frequencies.<nl><nl>Sauseng et al (2005) presented participants with directional cues indicating which hemifield the target stimuli would appear in. The target stimuli consisted of either small or large bars which participants identified and responded with \u2018s\u2019 for small and \u2018l\u2019 for large. Results showed that there was stronger alpha frequency suppression in brain areas contralateral to the targeted hemifield. This is due to visual stimuli being processed contralaterally. 200ms before the stimuli was presented, in active processing areas like the parietal lobe (P3), the alpha range is also lower. This study is supportive of AIM (Klimesch et al, 2007), and is used as the basis for this experiment, as it is a partial replication. In this experiment, the focus will be on the effect of arrow cues, specifically the direction they are facing.<nl><nl>Hypothesis<nl>As AIH states, alpha range activity is present in areas that are uninvolved in active processing and is suppressed in areas that actively process. By directing attention, and cueing the participant to expect the stimuli in a specific region they will begin paying attention. As shown by Sauseng et al (2005), visual stimuli is processed contralaterally resulting in alpha suppression in the other side of the brain. For example, if the stimuli is present in the left visual field it will be processed by the right hemisphere. By using the left parietal cortex (P3) to record alpha activity, it is expected that alpha activity will be greater when a stimulus is shown on the left and for this activity to be suppressed when the stimuli is on the right.<nl><nl>Method<nl>Participants<nl>39 undergraduate students were participants chosen from an opportunity sample.<nl><nl>Design<nl>This experiment uses a within subjects design. The dependent variable is the alpha range amplitudes (microvolts) on the left hand side of the parietal lobe (P3). The independent variable is the direction of the arrow cue, with two levels, left or right. <nl>Materials<nl>This experiment used a Biopac MP36 to collect data, EEG electrodes, AC Cream, Abrasive paste, PsychoPy to present stimuli and send event markers to Biopac through a Stimtracker device and stimuli (see figure 1). <nl><figure><nl><nl>Procedure<nl>The Biopac channel was set to record raw EEG by opening the Biopac student lab. From the \u2018analog\u2019 tab select Electroencaphagram (EEG)\u2019 \u20180.5-100Hz wnotch\u2019, so the 50Hz band is filtered out. Digital channels were set up to receive event markers from PsychoPy and the Stimtracker.. The \u2018calculation\u2019 tab allowed alpha frequency to be recorded. Then select \u2018EEG alpha 8-13Hz\u2019 from the drop down list. The sampling rate was 1000Hz. The participant was then prepared to be attached to the EEG. The electrode sites were abraded with everi cream using a cotton bud, and then AC cream was put on the electrodes. The electrodes are placed using the 1020 system. The active electrode was placed on P3. Participants were then given a cued visual task. A fixation cross was cued at the centre of the screen for 34ms, followed by an arrow indicating where to focus attention, with a 50% chance of it being cued left or right. There was then an interval of 600-800ms followed by a fixation cross for the second time, finally the participant was shown the target stimuli for 50ms, either a large or small white bar against a black background. Participants were then asked to use the keyboard to respond to the stimuli, typing either \u2018s\u2019 for small or \u2018l\u2019 for large. 75% of the trials were valid (the target stimuli was presented in the same hemifield that the arrow cue indicated), and 25% were invalid (the target stimuli was presented in the other hemifield). There were 20 blocks of the four trial types (cue left with a small bar, cue right with a small bar, cue left with a large bar and cue right with a large bar) so in total there were 80 trials.<nl><nl>Results<nl>There were transformations applied to the raw 9-13Hz alpha EEG data. There were eventmarkers received by PsychoPy through the Stimtracker, in order to identify when the stimuli was presented to the participants. The data also was used to specifically analyse from 200ms prior to stimulus onset after the directional arrow cues had been shown. Furthermore, the data was rectified, making negative values positive despite them showing excitatory or inhibitory activity. The samples were also averaged in order to limit the impact that outlying values would have on the data. This data is referred to as rectified and averaged alpha amplitudes (RAAA).<nl><nl>Descriptive Statistics<nl><table><nl><nl>Inferential Statistics <nl>The wilcoxon signed rank test showed that the difference was significant (T=566, n=38, p=.002).<nl><nl>Discussion<nl>The results of this experiment show that there was a significantly higher level of alpha activity when the stimulus was shown on the left hand side, this fit the original hypothesis. These results are consistent with AIH (Klimesch et al, 2007) as it shows that when participants are given a stimulus in their left hemifield, due to contralateral processing, this is processed by the right part of brain areas. As we were looking at P3, the left side of the parietal lobe, when shown a cue on the left it was processed on the right, meaning the left was task irrelevant and inattentive, resulting in higher alpha activity.<nl><nl>Methodological Problems<nl>Factors which may have confounded data include artefacts, which is when the EEG is contaminated by excess movement. When eye movements take place, the electrical activity could be recorded as brain activity. Eye movements could be blinking or horizontal eye movement, especially when having to look at either side of the screen. Blinking could also pose other issues such as the participant missing the cue. However, it does not seem to be too much of an issue and repetition and more trials would minimise the effects of this.<nl>Another issue could be the laboratory setting, as this could have an affect on brain activity. This is not a very normal situation for participants to be placed in so they may be uncomfortable or more alert as they know they are being studied. This could impact the EEG recordings as it is not a life-like situation so the results may not be generalisable to the whole population.<nl><nl>Conclusion<nl>Overall, the data is valid despite minor methodological issues, which after replication can minimise the effect of individual differences, such as blinking and horizontal eye movement. The data also supports AIH and produced the expected results.", "Erm, mm.  <misc> , what is a food I\u2019ve never tried. Mm. I have quite a lot.

So, I snack quite a bit more than actually cooking and eating, cooking and eating four meals, like I should be doing.

It looks as though the Black lady is- still she\u2019s sat down, and the white lady is stood up, possibly on a laptop.

{"id": "68b93c81-c410-4d43-838b-a3d52d6a5853", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl><nl>With the average person in the UK spending 110 minutes on social media, it is inevitable that content displayed across these platforms impact and influence societal norms. The nature of social media aids the ability for societal norms to not only be fueled and accepted across various cultures but also enable this to occur at an accelerated pace. However, the media has been proven to impact self-evaluation in a negative way. For example, there are numerous studies looking at women\u2019s self-evaluation, comparing weight-esteem based on neutral images or ideal images (Brown, Novick, Lord, &amp; Richards, 1992); self-worth based on social comparison (Jones &amp; Buckingham, 2005) etc. Unfortunately, looking at the effects on self-worth in men is minimal. This may be due to the rhetoric that portrays men as emotionless and when any type of emotion is displayed, idioms and phrases like \u2018be a man\u2019 or \u2018stop being a baby\u2019 comes into play. Due to this societal norm, it may make it difficult for men to be able to find appropriate support online and on social media platforms when struggling with the negative impact these sites can have on self worth. It is more acceptable for women to seek help online however, there is less support for men. By researching further into the impacts social media has on men\u2019s self worth, it can enable men to feel more comfortable when facing these issues. The research can aid understanding of this and also result in this topic becoming less taboo, giving a better chance for men to talk freely about their experiences.<nl><nl>I have investigated men\u2019s self worth in the context of social media and my main research question is \u2018How do young men talk about self worth within the context of social media (18-25)?\u2019. My method of analysis is discourse analysis as it allows for in-depth analysis into not only my participant\u2019s language use to construct ideas but also intonation. The interview will take place over a \u2018Zoom\u2019 video call, therefore I am able to have a video recording of all my participants' answers. <nl><nl>AnalysisResults<nl><nl>Through annotating my transcript I was able to select prominent themes that were discussed by my participant in the interview. These themes are spoken of throughout the interview and appear multiple times, even in different questions. From my initial question (line 7) I was able to determine that my participant is an avid user of social media, using it for entertainment purposes as well as using various platforms. This ensures that the questions I ask are relevant to my participant and the answers reflect their social media usage. <nl><nl>Key themes that were discussed by my participant include \"the ideal man\", involving image, appearance and social status; also \"alternate reality\", discussing not only the falseness of social media but also the construction of one's image on social media platforms.<nl><nl>The Ideal Man<nl><nl>The idea of \u2018the ideal man\u2019 featured within my participants answers multiple times, with a construction of what they personally believe to be the ideal man. As opposed to referring to what my participant feels they should look like, my participant instead suggests what others \"should be looking for\" (line 174) in a man, for example, the ideal height \"6 foot 4, or over 6 foot\" (line 175),  the ideal body, having \"six packs\" (line 138), adequate facial hair \"beard\" (line 176) etc. This is a very specific portrayal of men, suggesting that this is a common image for men to hold and strive to achieve. Although men do have an idea of what the ideal body type is they are also aware that in general life, this may not always be the case, with my participant stating that \"It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of me. It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of anyone I know.\" (line 162-163) when asked if he felt represented by men on social media. However, despite this acknowledgement, my participant still felt uncomfortable for comparisons between the appearance of men on social media and himself. My participant used the phrase \"I\u2019d prefer just to leave it at that\" (lines 161 and 294) indicating that men do feel uncomfortable about discussing their appearance, which supports the taboo of men expressing self-doubt and lacking self worth and lowered confidence. This would explain why my participant referred to other people he knows whenever talking about personal appearance, in order to make his answer generalised as opposed to solely him as well as deflect the discomfort about the fact that he is not the ideal man by justifying it with the fact that most people do not look like that. This is supported when he says \"I don\u2019t think many men would want to admit, especially among their peers, wouldn\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re not the ideal person.\" (lines 354-355) <nl><nl>In addition to the body image, a man\u2019s social status and financial status also seems to be prevalent when it comes to describing the \u2018ideal man\u2019 with my participant referring to men with \"seven figures\" (line 138), and men who have \"lavish\" (line 81 ) lifestyles. A given example was the actor and influencer \u2018Dan Bilzerian\u2019; well known for \"constantly flaunting a bunch of money\" (line 241) and \"constantly surrounded by money\". (line 242) This was someone who my participant would refer to as a \u2018role model\u2019 for most males. My participant also referred to the fact that \"men can be successful on social media without looking the greatest\" (line 225), due to their social and financial status. This is supported by the evolutionary psychology theory that women will desire men who are able to provide stability, in the forms of shelter, money, food etc. (Li, Li, Chan &amp; Zhang, 2016). This would explain that now in the digital age, men are able to attract attention with their wealth via social media through posting \"lavish\" (line 81) objects. As it is now commonplace for influencers to be posting this type of content, as my participant stated, \"ordinary people might look at that and think \u2018Well, that\u2019s not me\u2019.\"(line  So this becomes the new goals and the new norm. It is evident that the fact that my participant did not relate to these standards, as when asked if he felt represented by these role models and depictions of men he stated \"No. No. No. No I don\u2019t.\" (line 156) Being unable to relate to the norm often results in incongruence between one's actual self and ideal self which may lower self worth. (Rogers, 1959).<nl><nl>My participant states that they have changed themselves in order to conform with these standards, however wished not to elaborate on how he changed. Instead he referred to people that he knew of, talking about there being  \"a lot of men that will spend a bunch of time at the gym to try and achieve the body that every man wants.\" (lines 347-348) This emphasises that the pressures displayed online and on social media affects men enough for them to wish to change their lifestyle in order to relate to these standards. <nl><nl>Alternate Reality<nl><nl>Throughout my participants answers he refers to the fact that social media is \"not a true depiction\" (line 60) , is a \"very, very fake place\" (lines 104, 71, 63), \"is quite a negative place\" (lines 70, 84) , is \"not real\" (line 107) , is \"very unhealthy\" (line 117), has \"bad sides\" (line 123), is \"the furthest thing from real life\" (lines 147-148) etc. This is common in all the answers, and is said in multiple different ways. My participant referred to social media in very negative ways, and suggested it is a \"toxic\" (line 136) place, despite spending around \"5 hours\" (line 15) per day. This is not an uncommon amount of time on social media, however spending this much time surrounded by something that is perceived as negative by my participant, it is unsurprising that his self confidence is impacted. Also, despite this awareness of the fact that not everything is quite what it seems on social media, the standards are still internalised. This suggests that regardless of the reality or the accuracy of the things that one may be exposed to, they are still accepted by people and becomes the societal norm. My participant also refers to the fact that women are more educated about the ways images are distorted online as opposed to enhancements and photoshop for men.  <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl><nl>From my research, it is evident that despite being aware of the falseness and unrealistic standards of social media, it is evident that young men\u2019s self worth is impacted negatively by the content they are exposed to on social media. Despite being adamant that they are aware of the one sidedness of social media, men continue to make comparisons and draw from this to bring into real life situations. This makes it clear that men experience lowered self confidence not only looks wise but also based on their financial status, social status and more materialistic things. My research has also made it clear that men also feel pressure, and more should be done in terms of support for men online. However, regardless of the gender, social media does tend to display only positive events, making it harder for regular people to accept other events and negative things in real life.", "Favourite cuisine. Erm, I'm not really sure I have one but, mm, I\u2019ve recently got into, erm, Chinese food recently, recently. But erm, what\u2019s my favourite cuisine? I don\u2019t really have one, I\u2019ll just I like a mixture of things.<new>Erm, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just quite different and it\u2019s not the typical, erm, yeah, potatoes or steak or fries or whatever. It\u2019s just a different sort of, like a whole different country, different culture, different taste, different flavours. So, but, erm, something like dumplings, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have it on a normal day in your house. So, if I had that. And then yeah, you could go to the basic stuff like, er, egg fried rice or chicken fried rice, king prawn fried rice but, yeah, just different culture, I\u2019d say.<new>Oh, my favourite dish to cook. Erm, I mean, I can cook but I wouldn\u2019t say I'm the  <chef>  of the house  <laugh> . So, there\u2019s not much of a, a range to pick from. But erm, I would say, I can make my own roasts quite well, actually, er.<new>Yeah.<new><laugh> , okay. So, erm, it starts by getting your King Edward potatoes in. They usually have a bit of a red tint to them on the outside. So, then you just wash the potatoes, peel them, er, put a bit of salt, a bit of herbs on them, you know, cut them up, er, mix it all together. Then that\u2019s the potatoes done. And a trick my mum taught me is that you can boil the potatoes for a bit before you put them in the oven, which makes them all fluffy and actually cooks them quicker. So yeah, you season it all up and then I actually boil it. Then you put it into the oven and then that\u2019s the potatoes done. Then you get the sausages out of the pack, er, place it on a tray on the foil, put it inside the oven. Then the gravy, it\u2019s, it looks simple but it\u2019s actually kind of hard to make because if you get it too thick, like you\u2019re just eating slob. And if it\u2019s too thin, it\u2019s just water. So, you\u2019ve just got to, as you\u2019re pouring in the hot water, pour in the gra-, the granules at the same time and mix it consistently, otherwise, if you get lumps or it gets all thin, it\u2019s not really going to taste the best. So, whilst you\u2019re doing all of that, the ovens and the sausages are inside. So, erm, really and truly, when you\u2019re making the gravy, you\u2019re practically done. And then, obviously, you\u2019re boiling up all the carrots, the broccolis and then you plate up and you\u2019re done."]}

Thai food or, I would say Thai food, Chinese or American soul. It literally depends on my mood. So, Thai food, red Thai curry, the spicier the better, whereas you can also have prawn toast. I think prawn toast is more of a Chinese sort of thing but that, I love Chinese cuisine as well, Singapore fried rice. And then you have American soul food. So, that\u2019s like the hefty like burgers where it\u2019s just, it looks dirty like you have the chicken, bacon, everything  <unintelligible>  and the mash and peas and then the milkshakes and the fries. So, oh, it makes me hungry now  <laugh> . But yeah, erm, that would, those\u2019d probably be my favourite cuisines but. Because I can\u2019t make it at home, I can only eat it out. So yeah, it\u2019s more finding the best places that do those cuisines and then experimenting. But yeah, those are my favourite, I would think.<new>My favourite dish to cook would probably be  <unintelligible> , let\u2019s say than vegetarian than vegie lasagne. So, instead of the minced meat, in my family we use aubergine, courgettes, peppers. Mm, er, I make a  <unintelligible>  I make one in cheese sauce and like the tomato sauce and then we have like pasta sheets. So yeah, that would be my favourite meal to, probably, cook, that with garlic bread. But, obviously, if I\u2019m at uni, I\u2019d be doing, because I don\u2019t eat beef either, I would mix that up with, erm, turkey mince, which is a really, or lamb mince, which is a really good alternative. Apart from that, I would probably also say tacos. Tacos are my favourite to make but instead of, obviously, using beef, like I only, erm, would use black beans. So like, erm, that\u2019s really nice. And then we make our own guacamole and it\u2019s like with, ah, I love that too. Yeah, those are like my two favourite things to make.<new>Okay, yeah, sure. So, with the lasagne, I\u2019d say the lasagne\u2019s definitely the more complicated one, we start off by so, you obviously chop your aubergines, courgettes, peppers, chop them all, may, preferably into slices. And then we roast but whilst we roast, we add like our oil. So, I use chilli oil just because I like mine spicy. And yeah, so we roast. We have like a sort of grill thing so we let it roast for quite some time till all the vegetables like shrink. So, it\u2019s like aubergine goes like a really browny colour. But yeah, so we do that. I add on seasoning so salt, pepper, chilli powder. We add turmeric, erm, cumin. Oh gosh, what else do we add? Yeah, just th-those are the standard spices is what we add. Leave that to the side but like still ha-, keep it on low heat. And then we make the cheese sauce, which would be  <unintelligible> . Okay, so it\u2019s m-, butter and milk first, let it come to a simmer. Then add your two tablespoons of flour and then add, wait till it comes to a boi-, erm, comes to a boil? Yeah, so, when it starts bubbling, then you add all your cheese and I use like two hundred to three hundred grams of cheese just bec-, I like, er, I have this weird obsession with cheese. And, erm, yeah, so  <unintelligible>  that all in, you\u2019ve made your cheese sauce. Now, for the tomato sauce, we use tomato paste. We use a little bit of yoghurt, which isn\u2019t usually done in lasagne anyways but my family just like it like that. So, it\u2019s, erm, tomato paste and then also tinned tomatoes together. We add our seasonings into that as well, mostly chilli powder. We also use taco seasoning,  like the yea-, seasoning in our, erm, tomato sauce. I don\u2019t know why we do that. Then we add like a few, mm, diced peppers and stuff just to add some texture into the sauce. And then lastly, we have like the lasagne sheets. So, we don\u2019t make our own. I\u2019ve been trying to convince my family to buy a pasta machine but these guys don\u2019t want to listen to me. So, so, we get the ones where, erm, they\u2019re quite dry at first but you\u2019re meant to just put them into the baking tray but we don\u2019t do that. We, like a large bowl, fill that up with boiling water, let the pasta sheets soak in there until they\u2019re kind of soggy. But you\u2019re not mea-, you\u2019re not meant to do that but we do it anyway just because we\u2019re re-really scared that it\u2019s not going to cook. So then, each layer, so we put the, soak the pasta sheets, probably use a fork to like keep it dunked under the water, otherwise it sinks above. And then we have this huge lasagne like plate, I guess, and then we layer it. So, it goes pasta sheets, vegetables, tomato sauce, cheese sauce, another layer of pasta sheets and then we keep going in that consecutive order. And then at the top, we just add the cheese sauce all over it. Then the tomato goes on top. So, we do it in a different order. And then we just put a lot of like grated cheddar cheese on top. And then leave it in the oven for thirty to forty minutes until the top\u2019s all brown, take it out. By then the oven\u2019s hot so we use ready-made garlic bread and leave that in the oven for like eight to ten minutes and then by then, that\u2019s our meal completely done.", "Is is possible if I can change my <subject> grade to grade 8, <subject> grade to grade 7, and <subject> grade to grade 7.

Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state."]}

Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961). This definition further criticizes religion as something which individuals turn to out of worry and desperation.<nl>In addition to the functional definitions of religion which can be seen above, there is also the substantive definition of religion which can be investigated. Substantive definitions tend to define religion in terms of its content rather than its function. Here, it is common for the existence of a \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018supernatural being\u2019 to be present when defining religion. This can be seen in Roland Robertsons definition of religion, where he states that \u2018religion refers to the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life\u2019 (Robertson, 1970). Such definitions however, can be seen as problematic to the wider community. This definition of religion by Robertson, clearly necessitates the existence of a god, and rejects any ideas that do not have a \u2018god\u2019 at the centre of their ideology to be classed as religion. This would not allow for beliefs such as Buddhism to be categorised as a religion, due to the fact that it is not based upon the concept of a creator- God (Gethin, 1998). Robertson\u2019s view on religion is supported by Max Weber, who also uses a substantive concept of religion, seeing it as a belief in a divine entity which cannot be explained scientifically (Weber, 2009). In other words, the belief in a god is required for a concept to be deemed as a religion. Ronald Dworkin however, opposes this notion and states that \u2018religion, does not necessarily mean a belief in god\u2019 and \u2018religion is an interpretive concept\u2019 (Dworkin, 2013). Dworkins use of the word \u2018interpretive\u2019, infers that religion can have a different meaning, dependent on the individual. Buddhism has now been linked to the global category of a world religion (McMahan, 2012), causing much debate upon what constitutes religion. This begs the question, who has set the requirements for what can and cannot be defined as a religion? Who has the right to dictate this? As Aldridge states \u2018Defining religion involves an exercise of power\u2019 (Aldridge, 2007).<nl><nl>Religion in International Relations- Post Secularization and Foreign Policy <nl>Often, when analysing religion within the international relations scene it can be deemed an aspect which is hastily overlooked. Religion is rarely included in most major theories of international relations and this can be ascribed to major Western social thinkers rejecting the notion of religion (Fox and Sandler, 2004), as discussed previously. As a particular scholar illustrated , \u2018the role of religion in explaining attitudes toward issues of international relations is somewhat limited\u2019 (Jelen, 1994). However, when further analysing international relations and conflict, it is clear that religion can be seen as a crucial element which should not be disregarded. It has been said that \u2018Domestic conflicts, including religious conflicts are becoming increasingly international issues\u2019 (Fox and Sandler, 2004). This extract from \u2018Bringing religion into International Relations\u2019, further emphasis the vital role that religion can play when assessing international relations. Examples of conflict which involve religion are The Israel Palestine conflict and the Thirty Years war. Here, religion can be key in resolving and understanding the clash, possibly presenting a recourse. <nl>Post secularization, it has been noted that a global resurgence of religion is transforming our understanding of international relations (Thomas, 2005). As there has been an increase in religious actors, it has recently become a vital analytical focus (Haynes,2005). These religious actors can include examples such as foreign policy taking into account religion, as well as transnational factors. The more that religion begins to play a pivotal role in making country decisions, the more clarity there is on what a substantial role religion plays on the international scene. There has previously been a narrative which has pushed the notion that the term \u2018religion\u2019 carries negative connotations and only leads to tension and ferocity, bringing nothing of substance to the international relations division. This adheres to the \u2018Westphalian presumption\u2019, which holds that \u2018religious and cultural pluralism cannot be accommodated in international public life\u2019 (Thomas, 2005). In other words, faith must be conceived as an internal matter to the sovereign state in order to avoid the risk of potential religious wars. This has encouraged using scientific knowledge and clear reasoning as justification for decisions over religion. It is clear that during these strongly secular times, there wasn\u2019t a want to define the term \u2018religion\u2019 from an international perspective. However, as religion began to make a return to the international scene, events such as 911 and Samuel Huntingtons\u2019 famous \u2018The clash of civilizations?\u2019 thesis (Huntington, 2000), only drew more attention to the importance of religion on the international relations front. As there was deemed to be a rise in religious clash and issues, with pivotal events such as 911, the topic of religion had to be assessed on the international scale. <nl>Many would also agree that religion has an important role to play in creating and shaping beliefs, which may in turn influence the formulation of state policy and foreign policy considerations. An instance of this can be seen with President George W. Bush, where he referred to the US having a \u2018calling\u2019 and \u2018mission\u2019 by the \u2018Maker of heaven\u2019 in his speeches on Foreign Policy (Judis, 2005). Not only can it be inferred here that George Bush is attempting to appeal to his majority audience with his \u2018faithful\u2019 language, but his references to God here explain how religion has had a direct impact on the foreign policy choices made. Bush\u2019s choice of language and rhetoric is extremely influential in shaping perspectives of the US citizens opinions on foreign policy. It was found here that there was a clear link between religion and opinion on U.S foreign policy in the Middle East (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). In particular, Evangelical Christians are more supportive of Bush\u2019s Foreign policy on the Iraq war and his foreign policy in general (Pew Research Centre, 2020). In a specific study carried out by Pew Research Centre, even after adjusting for the identity of the respondents groups, the impact of Evangelical beliefs towards foreign policy towards the Middle East remained statistically important (Pew Research Centre, 2020). These results are significant as they provide confirmatory proof that the position of Evangelical affiliation in shaping public opinion on foreign policy is important. It is also fundamental in understanding what a large effect a single religious group can have on how a country is run. The Middle East and President George Bush are a great area of focus due to the Iraq war being a matter which has concerned wide-spread public opinion since 2003 (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). As Boyer stated \u2018For many believers in biblical prophecy, the Bush administration\u2019s go-it-alone foreign policy, hands-off attitude toward the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and proposed war on Iraq, are not simply actions in the national self-interest or an extension of the war on terrorism, but part of an unfolding divine plan\u2019 (Boyer, 2003). This quote highlights how it is recognised that many individuals feel as though these conflicts directly involve religion and god, not only country policy. This infers that individuals will use faith as a major indicator when deciding their stance on subjects such as the Iraq war and foreign policy. On the contrary, research from the Pew Research centre suggests that people feel as though their faith does not define their opinion on the Iraq War (Different Faiths, Different Messages, 2020). Either way, the fact that there is much debate around religion probes several questions on the topic of faith, making it a valid matter when discussing international relations. As religion is increasingly being used for justification as well as indication, it is an important matter to consider on the international scene. \u00a8<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, when looking at definitions of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the context of both Sociology and International relations, it is obvious that there is much debate around what the word entails and its specific effects on society, good or bad. It is clear however, that religion has played a large role in shaping and moulding the current societies that we live in today, as well as the international relations scene, be it secular or not. Although there may be much debate upon whether the consequences of religion are \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 and \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019, the simple fact that decisions have and are being made based upon this, make it a crucial element that must be taken into consideration when looking at both society and international relations. There is no doubt that further research in the field of religion is vital and needed in order for a wider understanding of religion and its impact in both contexts.", "Thankyou <addr1_FN>, <nl><nl>Just one last question!

I don\u2019t even think I\u2019ve tried shrimp. Yeah, crab and shrimp would probably be the things that I want to try because I\u2019ve seen it looks amazing and every time I see videos sort of online, I\u2019m like how, how haven\u2019t I tried it? But right now, there\u2019s not many places I can go to anyway to try it. But yeah. Or lobster! Lobster! I haven\u2019t tried lobster either, actually. Crab, lobster and shrimp, those, those are the three foods that I have never tried but as soon as lock-lockdown is over, I want,  <restaurant3> , it\u2019s meant to be amazing, in  <city1> . Yeah, I\u2019ve never been and I\u2019ve been saying that I need to go.

I\u2019ve already started saving but ah, it\u2019s bad. I\u2019m like a foodie to the  <unintelligible> .

So, I love it. I think people are not open enough to the idea of it so whenever like I make a new friend and I\u2019m like, \"By the way, we can\u2019t really eat meat in my house,\" they\u2019re always like, \"What?\" And there are so many alternatives that are not spoken about. I wish I could go vegan. I, w-, I genuinely wish I had to the willpower. I think I did try once but there are just not many alternatives that taste the same as cheese. But when it comes to like dairy free chocolate and stuff like, we\u2019re trying. I know my sister\u2019s new year\u2019s resolution is to go vegan for the year. So, I\u2019m the only one my hou-, my dad and I are the only people in the household that eat meat. So, my mum and my sister\u2019s vegetarian. So, it just mean my whole life I have not eaten meat. So, I, I c-, I could go without eating meat in my whole life one hundred percent. It\u2019s just I think in terms of when I was younger, I didn\u2019t like the food that my mum gave me, if that makes sense. Sometimes when you eat too many vegetables, you\u2019re like, it make you ki-, it makes you sick and then you realise you\u2019re not getting the nutrients you need. So, that\u2019s the only reason why I switched to eating meat. But apart from that, I\u2019m a hundred percent vouch  <unintelligible> . I think even at Nando\u2019s now, to this day, I will still get a beanie burger, like I wo-, I won\u2019t get the chicken option just because,  <misc> , I don\u2019t know what that burger tastes like and I would, I don\u2019t even want to eat meat. But then again, when you have like a really nice meat option, I\u2019m bound to choose the meat option. But yeah, I think, I would love to go completely vegetarian. And right now, I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen, you know, like Beyond Burger and stuff like, new, new brands that have come up, I\u2019m a big fan of Beyond Burger or Quorn, I eat it all. So, the, the, the, recently, they\u2019ve started, there\u2019s more brands as well, isn\u2019t there? So, recently they\u2019re getting there but, yeah, I completely vouch for it. I think one day... I also think going vegan is extremely expensive like we were looking at, erm, alternatives. So, I don\u2019t drink milk, I only drink soya milk. And although, actually, it\u2019s gotten a lot cheaper, other vegan alternatives are just, they\u2019re so expensive. I think, and it\u2019s, er, living in a house with your parents, I think unle-, until I move out and I can like, I\u2019m the one shopping for myself, I think it\u2019s not worth it. I think right now I\u2019ll stick to like food that we do eat now but yeah, I\u2019m quite happy being a vegetarian, like  <unintelligible> . The, ger-, the weird thing, actually, you know the first lockdown, it was from March until about August, I think and some restaurants and stuff opened. I, my grandparents were around and they\u2019re from India, but I didn\u2019t eat any meat from March to August. And when I went out for the first time, I ate a lot of meat. My body ended up rejecting all of it. So, I felt s-sick and it, I know it was so bad. I had  <unintelligible> , I was throwing up everywhere, I couldn\u2019t move, like I had to crawl down the stairs and like in tears, like  <unintelligible> , just so I could like  <unintelligible>  scream to get my parents\u2019 attention. Yeah, my body rejected it all. So, like after that, my parents were like, \"Okay, small amount of meat and do it slowly.\" And ever since then, I get really scared that if I have  <unintelligible> . That\u2019s why I think right now  <unintelligible>  open, I try and eat meat maybe once a week so my body doesn\u2019t get to what it did last year because yeah, oh, that was awful. I, I, I was going to die, like it was so bad. But yeah, so it\u2019s all good now  <laugh> .", "I\u2019m not in your group anymore, you\u2019re going to have to contact them individually<new>Hey!

{"id": "36203f06-b900-4840-9aab-eae5f3c785dc08729", "discourse_types": ["essay", "email"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl><nl>With the average person in the UK spending 110 minutes on social media, it is inevitable that content displayed across these platforms impact and influence societal norms. The nature of social media aids the ability for societal norms to not only be fueled and accepted across various cultures but also enable this to occur at an accelerated pace. However, the media has been proven to impact self-evaluation in a negative way. For example, there are numerous studies looking at women\u2019s self-evaluation, comparing weight-esteem based on neutral images or ideal images (Brown, Novick, Lord, &amp; Richards, 1992); self-worth based on social comparison (Jones &amp; Buckingham, 2005) etc. Unfortunately, looking at the effects on self-worth in men is minimal. This may be due to the rhetoric that portrays men as emotionless and when any type of emotion is displayed, idioms and phrases like \u2018be a man\u2019 or \u2018stop being a baby\u2019 comes into play. Due to this societal norm, it may make it difficult for men to be able to find appropriate support online and on social media platforms when struggling with the negative impact these sites can have on self worth. It is more acceptable for women to seek help online however, there is less support for men. By researching further into the impacts social media has on men\u2019s self worth, it can enable men to feel more comfortable when facing these issues. The research can aid understanding of this and also result in this topic becoming less taboo, giving a better chance for men to talk freely about their experiences.<nl><nl>I have investigated men\u2019s self worth in the context of social media and my main research question is \u2018How do young men talk about self worth within the context of social media (18-25)?\u2019. My method of analysis is discourse analysis as it allows for in-depth analysis into not only my participant\u2019s language use to construct ideas but also intonation. The interview will take place over a \u2018Zoom\u2019 video call, therefore I am able to have a video recording of all my participants' answers. <nl><nl>AnalysisResults<nl><nl>Through annotating my transcript I was able to select prominent themes that were discussed by my participant in the interview. These themes are spoken of throughout the interview and appear multiple times, even in different questions. From my initial question (line 7) I was able to determine that my participant is an avid user of social media, using it for entertainment purposes as well as using various platforms. This ensures that the questions I ask are relevant to my participant and the answers reflect their social media usage. <nl><nl>Key themes that were discussed by my participant include \"the ideal man\", involving image, appearance and social status; also \"alternate reality\", discussing not only the falseness of social media but also the construction of one's image on social media platforms.<nl><nl>The Ideal Man<nl><nl>The idea of \u2018the ideal man\u2019 featured within my participants answers multiple times, with a construction of what they personally believe to be the ideal man. As opposed to referring to what my participant feels they should look like, my participant instead suggests what others \"should be looking for\" (line 174) in a man, for example, the ideal height \"6 foot 4, or over 6 foot\" (line 175),  the ideal body, having \"six packs\" (line 138), adequate facial hair \"beard\" (line 176) etc. This is a very specific portrayal of men, suggesting that this is a common image for men to hold and strive to achieve. Although men do have an idea of what the ideal body type is they are also aware that in general life, this may not always be the case, with my participant stating that \"It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of me. It\u2019s not really an accurate depiction of anyone I know.\" (line 162-163) when asked if he felt represented by men on social media. However, despite this acknowledgement, my participant still felt uncomfortable for comparisons between the appearance of men on social media and himself. My participant used the phrase \"I\u2019d prefer just to leave it at that\" (lines 161 and 294) indicating that men do feel uncomfortable about discussing their appearance, which supports the taboo of men expressing self-doubt and lacking self worth and lowered confidence. This would explain why my participant referred to other people he knows whenever talking about personal appearance, in order to make his answer generalised as opposed to solely him as well as deflect the discomfort about the fact that he is not the ideal man by justifying it with the fact that most people do not look like that. This is supported when he says \"I don\u2019t think many men would want to admit, especially among their peers, wouldn\u2019t want to admit they\u2019re not the ideal person.\" (lines 354-355) <nl><nl>In addition to the body image, a man\u2019s social status and financial status also seems to be prevalent when it comes to describing the \u2018ideal man\u2019 with my participant referring to men with \"seven figures\" (line 138), and men who have \"lavish\" (line 81 ) lifestyles. A given example was the actor and influencer \u2018Dan Bilzerian\u2019; well known for \"constantly flaunting a bunch of money\" (line 241) and \"constantly surrounded by money\". (line 242) This was someone who my participant would refer to as a \u2018role model\u2019 for most males. My participant also referred to the fact that \"men can be successful on social media without looking the greatest\" (line 225), due to their social and financial status. This is supported by the evolutionary psychology theory that women will desire men who are able to provide stability, in the forms of shelter, money, food etc. (Li, Li, Chan &amp; Zhang, 2016). This would explain that now in the digital age, men are able to attract attention with their wealth via social media through posting \"lavish\" (line 81) objects. As it is now commonplace for influencers to be posting this type of content, as my participant stated, \"ordinary people might look at that and think \u2018Well, that\u2019s not me\u2019.\"(line  So this becomes the new goals and the new norm. It is evident that the fact that my participant did not relate to these standards, as when asked if he felt represented by these role models and depictions of men he stated \"No. No. No. No I don\u2019t.\" (line 156) Being unable to relate to the norm often results in incongruence between one's actual self and ideal self which may lower self worth. (Rogers, 1959).<nl><nl>My participant states that they have changed themselves in order to conform with these standards, however wished not to elaborate on how he changed. Instead he referred to people that he knew of, talking about there being  \"a lot of men that will spend a bunch of time at the gym to try and achieve the body that every man wants.\" (lines 347-348) This emphasises that the pressures displayed online and on social media affects men enough for them to wish to change their lifestyle in order to relate to these standards. <nl><nl>Alternate Reality<nl><nl>Throughout my participants answers he refers to the fact that social media is \"not a true depiction\" (line 60) , is a \"very, very fake place\" (lines 104, 71, 63), \"is quite a negative place\" (lines 70, 84) , is \"not real\" (line 107) , is \"very unhealthy\" (line 117), has \"bad sides\" (line 123), is \"the furthest thing from real life\" (lines 147-148) etc. This is common in all the answers, and is said in multiple different ways. My participant referred to social media in very negative ways, and suggested it is a \"toxic\" (line 136) place, despite spending around \"5 hours\" (line 15) per day. This is not an uncommon amount of time on social media, however spending this much time surrounded by something that is perceived as negative by my participant, it is unsurprising that his self confidence is impacted. Also, despite this awareness of the fact that not everything is quite what it seems on social media, the standards are still internalised. This suggests that regardless of the reality or the accuracy of the things that one may be exposed to, they are still accepted by people and becomes the societal norm. My participant also refers to the fact that women are more educated about the ways images are distorted online as opposed to enhancements and photoshop for men.  <nl><nl>Conclusion <nl><nl>From my research, it is evident that despite being aware of the falseness and unrealistic standards of social media, it is evident that young men\u2019s self worth is impacted negatively by the content they are exposed to on social media. Despite being adamant that they are aware of the one sidedness of social media, men continue to make comparisons and draw from this to bring into real life situations. This makes it clear that men experience lowered self confidence not only looks wise but also based on their financial status, social status and more materialistic things. My research has also made it clear that men also feel pressure, and more should be done in terms of support for men online.

I'm writing this email on behalf of us all in regards to the maintenance of the house.<nl><nl>Firstly, the fridge has been a recurring problem. This is because from day one it has always been difficult to fully close it - partly due to the design of the cupboard door and the fact that the freezer isn\u2019t working properly and as a result the ice builds up and doesn\u2019t allow it to close. This further prevents the fridge from closing properly in addition to the cupboard design door. This ongoing issue has resulted in numerous amounts of food not being kept properly and the unfortunate throwing away of them. We are all experiencing hard times as we attempt to continue living with COVID19, therefore the continuous cycle of buying food and it going off due to a dysfucntional and ineffective fridge makes these times just that much harder.<nl><nl>A contractor was sent out once and the service he provided was not good enough as this is still a very important issue - if not the most important as it directly effects our health and safety.<nl><nl>Another issue in the kitchen is that one of the lower cabinet doors has come off. I believe the inside components have snapped and the repair will require new parts.<nl><nl>The last of the issues in the kitchen is the metal wall section behind the sink. The bottom part of it has opened and essentially began to peel off. This also needs to be fixed because if its allowed to continue peeling the wall behind it will start to get wet from the sink and cause further damage to the property.<nl><nl>In line with maintenance requests, it has also been brought to my attention that the top floor tenant is extremely unhappy with the mattress she is having to use as she says all she can feel is the springs within it. This causes severe joint and shoulder pain - again this is important as it has a direct impact on her health. If this could be replaced it would be most helpful, as we are timely paying tenants who don\u2019t believe this to be an unjust request.<nl><nl>I did contact the <business> property management mobile contact number ending 152, I was directed to report all maintenance issues through property file. However, we were not given access to this platform and so can\u2019t use it. I did reply and let the person know this but I received no reply to that message and the maintenance issues are still outstanding.<nl><nl>I look forward to what solutions you are able to offer and hope to hear from you soon.<nl><nl><part_FN_SN>"]}

{"id": "7cfa678e-dfdc-4bc9-ac45-6c8f7ef039a807060", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["New liberalism was born after a new wave of liberals in the late 19th century to the early 20th century challenged the positions of classical liberals such as Adam Smith and John Locke. Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state.", "Erm, mm.  <misc> , what is a food I\u2019ve never tried.

{"id": "5d4efa25-4f83-4dcd-a6cd-687b54e52a0300222", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["New liberalism was born after a new wave of liberals in the late 19th century to the early 20th century challenged the positions of classical liberals such as Adam Smith and John Locke. Smith and Locke wanted to limit the power that the government holds whereas these new liberals argued the state should play a more active role to provide for citizens. Social liberalism on the leftright ideological spectrum falls onto the centre left as they occupy a position which is nearer to socialists and today\u2019s Labour party.\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Karl Marx, a well-known socialist , was known to criticise liberalism \u2013 we can see Marx\u2019s view on the state in his book The German Ideology (1846) as he claims the state is a creature of the bourgeois economic interest. When looking at contradictions such as free market liberalism, industrialization and urbanization it is easy to understand why he believed this, Marx believed that liberalism was a cover for the economic exploitation of the working class. \"The executive of the modern state is nothing but a committee for managing the common affairs on the whole bourgeoisie.\" (Marx:1846) Due to responses like these from Marx and other socialists, a new strand of liberal thought was introduced known as social liberalism, new liberalism, modern liberalism and sometimes even welfare liberalism \u2013 Thomas Hill Green was the reason for this. Thomas Hill Green (1836-82) was a British philosopher who rejected utilitarianism and rationalist assumptions which were that humans are driven by self-interest emphasising instead the complex circumstances that are involved in the evolution of people\u2019s moral character. Green believed that self-realization was only possible when people lived together harmoniously within society. Green is more of a communitarian thinker than the individualism you see within classical liberalism \u2013 participation within the community was the highest form of self-development in his eyes, he is departing from the kind of individualism that is seen in the likes of Adam Smith who is a classical liberal.\u00a0<nl><nl>Part of Thomas Hill Greens philosophical proposition for social liberalism was the notion of distinguishing between negative and positive forms of Liberty. Negative Liberty which is supported by classical liberalists, is the absence of obstacles, barriers or constraints to action. Negative liberty is the kind of liberty that classical liberals were emphasising \u2013 their interests were in removing obstacles one may face to the exercise of one\u2019s freedoms, this could be things such as intrusive governments and traditional hierarchies. An emphasis on negative Liberty logically leads one to think about how one can remove obstacles so that Liberty can be exercised in an unconstrained manner, hence the limiting of government authority. However, Green thinks that classical liberals are mistaken because they ignore another important dimension of Liberty. In comparison, Positive Liberty is the possibility of acting in such a way as to take control of one's life and realise one\u2019s fundamental purposes. For example, if you are poor, you cannot fully be self-realising or self-determining as there are structural economic constraints which the free marketplaces have on the ability to be free. If seen through this lens, the state could potentially help people exercise their freedoms by providing them with welfare and a safety net rather than the state being purely an obstacle to freedom. Thomas Hill Green\u2019s view on the state is the same as many other social liberals as they support the \u2018enabling state\u2019 which is where the state would protect individual freedoms. In his book, Lectures on the Principles of Political Obligation he says he needs \u2018fences\u2019 to protect his freedom of thoughts and actions. The fences can be seen as rights, \"a right is a power of which the Exercise by the individual or by somebody of men is recognised by a society either as itself directly essential to a common good or as conferred by an authority of which the maintenance is recognised as so essential. (LPPO:1886) This involves reducing inequality and providing everyone an equal opportunity no matter how rich or poor. A more modern example of this can be the coronavirus restrictions as classical liberals may argue that the government shouldn\u2019t enforce rules on people to spread the COVID-19 disease, whereas social liberals are more open to these rules as they emphasise positive liberty. You cannot exercise your right of liberty if you\u2019re suffering from the long term and even deadly symptoms of the virus.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0<nl>\u00a0<nl>Unlike liberal economists like Adam Smith (who believed a free market is the best way of achieving prosperity), modern Liberalists support \u2018Keynesianism\u2019 a term which comes from the economist John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) Keynes role of the state was that governments should increase spending and lower taxes when being faced with a recession. Keynesianism is basically a rejection of classical liberal laissez faire economics. In the first half of the 20th century, free market capitalism was attacked and was followed by the wall street crash 1929 and The Great Depression leading to mass unemployment. Keynes argued that austerity policies had sucked the demand out of the economy and slowed the economic recovery - his economic thinking became hugely influential in the succeeding decades and contributed to the idea called social liberalism. A primary example of Keynesianism can be linked to President Franklin D Roosevelt new deal policies which were a series of public works projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted during the 1930s to relieve and reform the US economy. In the wake of the Great Depression, Roosevelt is today still seen as the major historical figure when it comes to American social liberalism.\u00a0<nl><nl>Liberals are seen to be a group of people who subscribe to liberalism overall and its politics. Based on freedom, consent of the governed and equality before the law, liberalism has a traditional view on the state; less is more. They believe in individual rights - a combination of civil rights and human rights. Furthermore, they support minimal regulations as the removal of red tape enables the boost in revenues and profits. Therefore, in view of the state\u2019s role in society, it is a rather minor one. In which they will agree to a limited government to guarantee safety and protection. The overarching role of the state in which liberals widely agree on is just that - limited but just enough to guarantee security of the immoral part of society. However, there are many factions within liberalism, namely classical liberals, social liberals, and neo-liberals. Over the course of this essay, all three will be explored and their individual opinions on the role of the state further explained.\u00a0\u2028<nl>Classical liberalism is an early faction of liberalism that relies heavily on the concept of liberty and as a result opposes the increase in the role of state. These ideas emerged from contradictory theories of natural law, utilitarianism, and a belief in progress. Furthermore, its ideas were seen to be related to the early 19th century and built around the response to urbanization and to the Industrial revolution in North America and Europe.\u00a0<nl><nl>It very much supports the reduction in restriction and the promotion of a laissez faire society \u2013 especially in its economics. Laissez-faire, a term coined by Scottish economist Adam Smith, is a French phrase that directly translates as \u2018allow to do\u2019. This emphasises the point of minimum governmental interference in economic affairs of individuals and the society they live in. A key liberalist thinker is John Locke, he believed people are autonomous and competent enough to have control over themselves. His pioneering work is known as the social contract theory, an agreement in which an invisible contract between the people and the state is made. Within this, the stipulations are that the people voluntarily give some power back to the centralized government to confirm and guarantee specific freedoms and security. (Second Treatise on Civil Government 1690, L John) , Locke says \u2018Government has no other end, but the preservation of property\u2019. This further emphasises the limited responsibility classical liberals place on the state. As John Stuart Mill said, \u2018an individual is the best judge of their own interests and no authority can claim superior knowledge\u2019( On Liberty - Mill, John, 1859). However, individuals consent to be governed as some type of framework and set of guidelines cannot be too harmful to society and its inhabitants.\u00a0\u2028<nl>A more contemporary example of liberalism and its opinion on the state\u2019s role is the fact that there is currently a separation of powers within the United Kingdom. This refers to the fact that the executive is split between United Kingdom government, Scottish Government, Welsh Government and Northern Ireland executive. Within that, there are usually 3 branches that represent further separation of powers \u2013 Legislative, Executive and Judicial. Over the course of the world\u2019s progression, it has been noticed that a considerable amount of power existing mainly in the hands of one person or group leads to others being oppressed or their powers and freedoms restricted. The original for the separation of powers may be due to the scepticism surrounding the government and their work in protecting and enabling individuals to enjoy their chosen lifestyle. This is where the government are seen to be overreaching and almost interfering in its role of the state. However, this could be positive as the separation of powers provides a vital system of checks and balances, making all the institutions accountable to each other. In addition, it divides power between the institutions \u2013 to ensure that no group or individual is all powerful. In reference back to liberalism and its role on the state, that is a top priority as liberals oppose excess control and see humans are competent enough to shape their own lives.\u00a0<nl><nl>An example of a state which adopts classical liberalist ideas to support their view on the role of the state is New Zealand as its political system is limited to liberal parties with substantial support \u2013 which is reflected by their representation in Parliament. This is because among civil liberties available worldwide they are noticeably ranked quite high and even ranked third most economically free country. This could be because both the major parties in New Zealand have included aspects of classical liberalism within their politics. The Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1984 is a great example as it gave the union members another layer of protection.\u00a0\u00a0<nl>In contrast, other liberals may not agree with classical liberalism. This could be because they believe it to be too free and almost lacking in guidance or direction. An example is in modern liberalism, a stance on topics such as discrimination is needed and if possible, legislation changes at the end of it. However, classical liberals would see this as too intrusive as imposing further laws on the people is creating more regulation. Another reason as to why liberals may not agree with the classical idea is, that about The Great Depression 1929-1933, once international lending and tariffs were decreased this had a direct effect on the revenues of each country \u2013 a main cause of the depression (Causes of the Great Depression D,Brian).\u00a0\u2028<nl>This global and very much public showing of laissez faire failing was what sparked the questioning of classical liberalism and brought about the inevitable emergence of social liberalism; named the \u2018New Liberalism\u2019.\u00a0<nl><nl>The emergence of Neoliberalism in the late 1970s, after the crisis of Keynesian Macroeconomics, has been controversial in how liberalists view the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism has been referred to as the resurgence of the 19th-century ideas associated with laissez-faire capitalism. Before this, anti-liberal trends had formed in the 1930s due to rises in protectionism, the New Deal in the United States, and more totalitarianism in Europe (Davies, 2014). However in 1944, the publication of Hayek\u2019s book \u2018The Road to Serfdom \u2018 was the grand introduction to rectifying liberal thoughts. He was an advocate for a free-market economy whilst limiting state control as he felt that it would harm an individuals\u2019 liberty. These ideas are very similar to classical liberalism on liberty however neo-liberalism focal point has only been to promote more economic prosperity but not emphasising the different types of liberty. Hayek also proposed that totalitarianism is the new word to describe socialism (Davies, 2014).\u00a0 However, Liberal thinkers especially social-liberalism would question this. We need to take into consideration what Hayek wrote during the Second World War whereby the totalitarianism regime was dominated across all regimes. In today's society, totalitarian states have declined due to the development of institutions such as the IMF and WTO to promote economic propensity whilst having some form of intervention by the state. That means that to some extent, social liberalism can feature in neoliberal thinking in explaining the role of the state.<nl>\u00a0<nl>Neoliberalism was initially exploited during the Thatcherism and Reaganomics era during the late 1970s before neoliberal policies were used internationally. Despite representing conservatives they were considered liberal thinkers. Similar to earlier Neoliberal thinkers, they believed free markets can promote more economic propensity in the global market. However, Thatcherism can be questioned on whether neoliberal ideas shaped the policies. We understand that neoliberalism can create a market state but this may not be the case if the government is not highly invasive. If we consider this, that ultimately means that the role of the state should be essential in neoliberal thinking to form a market state.", "Erm, typically, I would say you can start from the night before so, usually would have a few snacks next to my bed on my table side, er, bed. So, I usually have, er, Maryland cookies or some type of random sweets or Twix or some type of candy or something and, er, usually with a Fanta on the side of it.

And then yeah, it just depends, really, when I sleep when I have my next meal but really and truly, it\u2019s probably another sort of snack, yeah. <new>In terms of, er, which one do I like the most or which one is most beneficial to me?<new>Oh. Before like, erm, I\u2019ve always liked breakfast, it\u2019s always been my, it\u2019s always been my favourite meal of the day, \u2018cause I, I, I learnt how to cook, erm, I learnt how to cook it quite early as well. I used to make eggs, the, the bread, the, warm up the beans, you know, I, I liked cooking breakfast. So, I would say yeah, that\u2019s the one I enjoy the most and yeah, I do think it is the most important as well, actually. Yeah, it sets up your day, you know?<new>I would say, mm, what\u2019s my favourite dish? Probably Sunday roast, I would say, yeah. And my mum makes it quite nice, actually, so. And it\u2019s not even just on Sundays we have it. In a week, typically, you\u2019d have it about twice. So, yeah, that is my favourite, with the potatoes, the sausages, chipolatas, to be specific. Chipolatas, er, gravy next to it, broccoli, carrots and, yeah, that\u2019s my favourite meal I would say."]}

Er, one white female and another Black female. And I can just tell by the way the\u2026 okay, so the background is white as well, and the, the white female\u2019s standing up and almost bending over, and er, I can see it\u2019s a sort of teacher and student relationship. And they\u2019re both, you know, quite smiling a bit, so, erm. She\u2019s also, the teacher\u2019s also rolled their sleeves up, and she\u2019s got a black hairband on her right wrist, and she\u2019s let her blonde hair down. And erm, the student is sitting in the chair with her braids, and she\u2019s smiling quite a bit with her teeth showing as well. And erm, she\u2019s using her right hand to touch her chest, so I think they\u2019re just sharing a moment. So that\u2019s image one. And erm,  <misc>  in image two, there\u2019s a white background with a sort of uni, er, couch setup. And there\u2019s two males; er, one who\u2019s got a black earring in his left ear, and er, another who\u2019s also wearing a red, er, red shirt over a white, er, t-shirt. And they\u2019re both, er, sitting behind a Mac, and they\u2019re just looking at the computer. So I think they might be computing students or some type of technology involved in their, er, degrees also. Erm, the laptop\u2019s actually on a black sort of coffee table. And erm, yeah, it just looks like they\u2019re students on the same sort of course and, you know, just doing a bit of work together. So that\u2019s image two. And in image three, the background is almost a circle of white beads, o- placed on a black, er, background board. And it\u2019s got two, er, people in it. Er, one, er female and one male. Erm, she\u2019s wearing a leather black jacket and he\u2019s also g- holding a book. And I do believe there might be a third person in the picture but they\u2019re just out of the scene. So yeah, they\u2019re sitting on a, I think it\u2019s a red or sort of er, a rose type couch, and er, they\u2019ve got a glass coffee table in front of them. Er, the man\u2019s got a beard and, er, he\u2019s smiling quite a bit, with a green top under his black, er, inspector gadget jacket,  <laugh>  some people would say. Erm, he\u2019s wearing some, er, brown khaki trousers \u2013 no, brown trousers, yeah. And er, the lady\u2019s wearing some brown boots with red leggings, I would say. Erm, you can\u2019t really see it too caref- too well, but er, she\u2019s got some earrings I think, that are dangling. So er, yeah, that\u2019s pretty much it. So yeah, I would say they\u2019re, they\u2019re both students as well, because they\u2019ve got a book. And er, I don\u2019t know who the third character in the picture is as we can\u2019t really see, but we can just see one of his hands. But yeah. And there\u2019s a leaflet on the glass coffee table in front of them. And that\u2019s it for picture three."]}

There\u2019s one woman standing and one woman sitting. Erm, one woman\u2019s wearing a striped black and white tee shirt with black jeans and one\u2019s wearing a denim jacket. One of them seems to be laughing and is looking at someone else, whereas one of them is looking down. The woman standing is the one wearing the striped tee shirt. She\u2019s also got blonde hair and seems to be involved in something. She looks busy. The other woman has braids and she seems to be engaged in conversation with someone and is laughing. The second image has two men. One of them is wearing a t-s-, checked shirt and the other is wearing a floral tee shirt. The one wearing the floral tee shirt is looking at the man wearing the stripe, er, the checked shirt. The one wearing the checked shirt is looking at a laptop. The laptop is a MacBook and it\u2019s on a table. The background is spotty. Erm, the background is spotty. The laptop is on the table. They seem like they\u2019re doing some type of work but nothing too stressful because the one in the shirt is smiling and so is the one in the tee shirt. In the third image, two people are sitting next to each other. One\u2019s a woman and one\u2019s a man. They\u2019re both wearing jackets. The woman\u2019s wearing a bl-black leather jacket with a black tee shirt and red jeans with some boots. The man\u2019s wearing a grey jacket with a green tee shirt and brown trousers. The man is holding a book and they\u2019re both looking at the same person. You can see the person\u2019s hand in the corner. There\u2019s, in the background, there\u2019s more spots but they\u2019re in a circle. And they both seem happy because they\u2019re smiling."]}

So, usually, I would be working so in that case, I would probably wake up, do my normal exercise and then eat but I would eat breakfast at around ten to eleven. So, that would either be pancakes or mostly beans on toast, eggs on toast, anything with my beans, I don\u2019t usually eat normal beans, I like spicy beans, which is a bit weird. But yeah, anything like that. If there\u2019s any, if it\u2019s around lunchtime, it would probably be something frozen so like frozen pizza or like frozen burgers.

So, that would, so it would probably be like a margherita pizza or, you know, you have those like readymade noodles, could be those. But yeah, lunch would probably be a quick meal. Dinner is probably where we like eat the most. So, dinner for me, so I\u2019m on, I\u2019m  <continental_adj>  so it would typically be Asia-, it would be  <country1_adj>  food or sometimes, it, anything we eat would probably be vegetable orientated. So, it would either be, if it\u2019s Mexican, we\u2019ll have like loads of vegetables in a wrap, we have veg, veggie pasta. We eat dinner at around six to seven and then if any of us are hungry after, there\u2019s always like chocolate or snacks or food that we can eat after but usually, we\u2019re all full by dinner anyways.

If I\u2019m working then I\u2019m going to be eating dinner. I mean, I\u2019m going to be eating lunch at work but my lunch will be dinner from the day before.

And that if I, the rest of the day I can go without eating until dinner. For example, today, I just had like two mozzarella and pesto sandwiches. I\u2019m probably not going to be eating until like six or seven p.m. So, that\u2019s, yeah, I would say that\u2019s the most important meal, just \u2018cause you have energy. Otherwise, if you\u2019re waiting for dinner, by then my stomach aches and then you know when you go, you\u2019re in bed and you, you\u2019re just tired because you haven\u2019t eaten?

{"id": "794fa65a-afe7-4968-b059-2e6c9c4e0d78", "discourse_types": ["essay", "interview"], "pair": ["Introduction <nl>What is religion? Such a terse question, yet one of the most contentious, challenging and debateable questions around. The Cambridge English dictionary defines religion as the \u2018belief in and worship of a god or gods, or any such system of belief and worship\u2019 (Cambridge English Dictionary, 2020). This can be assumed to be the conventional interpretation of the word. This essay will delve deeper into the complex world of religion, exploring meanings of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the contexts of both sociology as well as international relations, in order to further grasp this enigma. More precisely, within the sociological realm both the functional as well as substantive definitions of religion will be studied. Interpreting the conclusions of numerous classical thinkers, such as Karl Marx and Emile Durkheim, their views will be compared and contrasted with more recent literature on the subject of religion. On the international relations front, the roller-coaster of a reputation that religion has had within international affairs will be assessed, where secularisation plays a large role. For example, through analysing the role of religion in the formulation of foreign policy and country relationships, a more comprehensive understanding of the word \u2018religion\u2019 will be reached, enabling the assessment of its role in the international society we live in today. <nl><nl>The Sociological definitions of Religion- Functional and Substantive <nl>When examining sociological roots and religion, the perceptions of classical theorists are crucial in understanding how the field has been defined for many years. One of the earliest classical thinkers in this region, Emile Durkheim, viewed religion as a \u2018social force\u2019 (Press and Swatos, 1998). He saw religion as an almost social glue which reinforced society. A replaceable theory, that could disappear if social cohesion was to vanish. In his book \u2018The Division Of Labour In Society\u2019, Durkheim states that religion is simply \u2018something social\u2019(Durkheim, 2013). This aligns with James Beckford outlook, who claims that religion is constructed (Beckford, 2003). These two individuals simply considered religion to be a product of society. Durkheim can be seen to have more of a positivist outlook on religion, claiming it was an expression of \u2018social cohesion\u2019 (Durkheim, 2013). In other words, it was religion in his eyes, which held complex societies together, a recourse. This infers that it is in fact faith, which allows societies to develop, prosper and thrive. However, unlike Durkheim, Beckford regarded religion as a tool which is used by several agents, for instance, in areas such as education, law and health (Beckford, 2003). He claims that this advocates to more heated conflict and discussion around religion from a social perspective. Beckfords train of thought contradicts this idea of religion being a social glue and he argues that religion gives rise to more disagreement in society. For example, should certain religious attire be permitted in schools? (Beckford, 2003). Although these two theorists may have opposing opinions on the consequences of religion, they both clearly allude to how religion can be simply seen as a product of human activity, rather than a result of divine intervention. <nl>On the contrary to Durkheims quite positive outlook on religion and its effects on society, Karl Marx is a theologian well known for his nefarious opinion on religion. He famously quoted \u2018Religion is the opium of the people\u2019 (Yilmaz, 2018). This statement expounds how Marx perceived religion to be detrimental to society, something which obstructed individuals from seeing the truth of their reality. His tactful use of the word \u2018opium\u2019 castigates religion as a whole, emphasising its roll in dulling the senses and causing the miseries of the presence to be overlooked. Marx describes religion as the \"existence of a defect, where the source of this defect can only be sought in the nature of the state itself\" (Marx, 2000). This denotes how Marx viewed religion as a tool for the state, a weapon to reinforce class divide, justify oppression and strategically only serve those in power. He goes on to explain how religion is what people will turn to out of fear of life\u2019s eternal questions, in turn facilitating the rich and empowering those in control, whilst the working class blindly follow suit (Marx, 2000). Marx saw religion as a form of support for these working class individuals, as well as those he deemed to be weak minded. An example of this can be seen in the Bible, \u2018Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth\u2019 Matthew 5:3 (Manns, 2000). It can be inferred that in this bible verse, Christianity is pushing the notion that suffering in this temporary life, can only lead to an abundance of reward in the afterlife. This interpretation can be further accentuated through Milton Yingers definition of religion, where he illustrates religion to be \u2018a system of beliefs and practices, by means of which a group of people struggles with the ultimate problems of life\u2019 (Yinger,1961). This definition further criticizes religion as something which individuals turn to out of worry and desperation.<nl>In addition to the functional definitions of religion which can be seen above, there is also the substantive definition of religion which can be investigated. Substantive definitions tend to define religion in terms of its content rather than its function. Here, it is common for the existence of a \u2018god\u2019 or \u2018supernatural being\u2019 to be present when defining religion. This can be seen in Roland Robertsons definition of religion, where he states that \u2018religion refers to the existence of supernatural beings that have a governing effect on life\u2019 (Robertson, 1970). Such definitions however, can be seen as problematic to the wider community. This definition of religion by Robertson, clearly necessitates the existence of a god, and rejects any ideas that do not have a \u2018god\u2019 at the centre of their ideology to be classed as religion. This would not allow for beliefs such as Buddhism to be categorised as a religion, due to the fact that it is not based upon the concept of a creator- God (Gethin, 1998). Robertson\u2019s view on religion is supported by Max Weber, who also uses a substantive concept of religion, seeing it as a belief in a divine entity which cannot be explained scientifically (Weber, 2009). In other words, the belief in a god is required for a concept to be deemed as a religion. Ronald Dworkin however, opposes this notion and states that \u2018religion, does not necessarily mean a belief in god\u2019 and \u2018religion is an interpretive concept\u2019 (Dworkin, 2013). Dworkins use of the word \u2018interpretive\u2019, infers that religion can have a different meaning, dependent on the individual. Buddhism has now been linked to the global category of a world religion (McMahan, 2012), causing much debate upon what constitutes religion. This begs the question, who has set the requirements for what can and cannot be defined as a religion? Who has the right to dictate this? As Aldridge states \u2018Defining religion involves an exercise of power\u2019 (Aldridge, 2007).<nl><nl>Religion in International Relations- Post Secularization and Foreign Policy <nl>Often, when analysing religion within the international relations scene it can be deemed an aspect which is hastily overlooked. Religion is rarely included in most major theories of international relations and this can be ascribed to major Western social thinkers rejecting the notion of religion (Fox and Sandler, 2004), as discussed previously. As a particular scholar illustrated , \u2018the role of religion in explaining attitudes toward issues of international relations is somewhat limited\u2019 (Jelen, 1994). However, when further analysing international relations and conflict, it is clear that religion can be seen as a crucial element which should not be disregarded. It has been said that \u2018Domestic conflicts, including religious conflicts are becoming increasingly international issues\u2019 (Fox and Sandler, 2004). This extract from \u2018Bringing religion into International Relations\u2019, further emphasis the vital role that religion can play when assessing international relations. Examples of conflict which involve religion are The Israel Palestine conflict and the Thirty Years war. Here, religion can be key in resolving and understanding the clash, possibly presenting a recourse. <nl>Post secularization, it has been noted that a global resurgence of religion is transforming our understanding of international relations (Thomas, 2005). As there has been an increase in religious actors, it has recently become a vital analytical focus (Haynes,2005). These religious actors can include examples such as foreign policy taking into account religion, as well as transnational factors. The more that religion begins to play a pivotal role in making country decisions, the more clarity there is on what a substantial role religion plays on the international scene. There has previously been a narrative which has pushed the notion that the term \u2018religion\u2019 carries negative connotations and only leads to tension and ferocity, bringing nothing of substance to the international relations division. This adheres to the \u2018Westphalian presumption\u2019, which holds that \u2018religious and cultural pluralism cannot be accommodated in international public life\u2019 (Thomas, 2005). In other words, faith must be conceived as an internal matter to the sovereign state in order to avoid the risk of potential religious wars. This has encouraged using scientific knowledge and clear reasoning as justification for decisions over religion. It is clear that during these strongly secular times, there wasn\u2019t a want to define the term \u2018religion\u2019 from an international perspective. However, as religion began to make a return to the international scene, events such as 911 and Samuel Huntingtons\u2019 famous \u2018The clash of civilizations?\u2019 thesis (Huntington, 2000), only drew more attention to the importance of religion on the international relations front. As there was deemed to be a rise in religious clash and issues, with pivotal events such as 911, the topic of religion had to be assessed on the international scale. <nl>Many would also agree that religion has an important role to play in creating and shaping beliefs, which may in turn influence the formulation of state policy and foreign policy considerations. An instance of this can be seen with President George W. Bush, where he referred to the US having a \u2018calling\u2019 and \u2018mission\u2019 by the \u2018Maker of heaven\u2019 in his speeches on Foreign Policy (Judis, 2005). Not only can it be inferred here that George Bush is attempting to appeal to his majority audience with his \u2018faithful\u2019 language, but his references to God here explain how religion has had a direct impact on the foreign policy choices made. Bush\u2019s choice of language and rhetoric is extremely influential in shaping perspectives of the US citizens opinions on foreign policy. It was found here that there was a clear link between religion and opinion on U.S foreign policy in the Middle East (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). In particular, Evangelical Christians are more supportive of Bush\u2019s Foreign policy on the Iraq war and his foreign policy in general (Pew Research Centre, 2020). In a specific study carried out by Pew Research Centre, even after adjusting for the identity of the respondents groups, the impact of Evangelical beliefs towards foreign policy towards the Middle East remained statistically important (Pew Research Centre, 2020). These results are significant as they provide confirmatory proof that the position of Evangelical affiliation in shaping public opinion on foreign policy is important. It is also fundamental in understanding what a large effect a single religious group can have on how a country is run. The Middle East and President George Bush are a great area of focus due to the Iraq war being a matter which has concerned wide-spread public opinion since 2003 (Baumgartner, Francia and Morris, 2008). As Boyer stated \u2018For many believers in biblical prophecy, the Bush administration\u2019s go-it-alone foreign policy, hands-off attitude toward the Israeli- Palestinian conflict, and proposed war on Iraq, are not simply actions in the national self-interest or an extension of the war on terrorism, but part of an unfolding divine plan\u2019 (Boyer, 2003). This quote highlights how it is recognised that many individuals feel as though these conflicts directly involve religion and god, not only country policy. This infers that individuals will use faith as a major indicator when deciding their stance on subjects such as the Iraq war and foreign policy. On the contrary, research from the Pew Research centre suggests that people feel as though their faith does not define their opinion on the Iraq War (Different Faiths, Different Messages, 2020). Either way, the fact that there is much debate around religion probes several questions on the topic of faith, making it a valid matter when discussing international relations. As religion is increasingly being used for justification as well as indication, it is an important matter to consider on the international scene. \u00a8<nl><nl>Conclusion <nl>In conclusion, when looking at definitions of the term \u2018religion\u2019 in the context of both Sociology and International relations, it is obvious that there is much debate around what the word entails and its specific effects on society, good or bad. It is clear however, that religion has played a large role in shaping and moulding the current societies that we live in today, as well as the international relations scene, be it secular or not. Although there may be much debate upon whether the consequences of religion are \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018wrong\u2019 and \u2018positive\u2019 or \u2018negative\u2019, the simple fact that decisions have and are being made based upon this, make it a crucial element that must be taken into consideration when looking at both society and international relations. There is no doubt that further research in the field of religion is vital and needed in order for a wider understanding of religion and its impact in both contexts.", "Go to order. Er, this is quite a recent one as well, actually. Erm, my favourite restaurant, I would say, is  <restaurant1>  and my go to dish from there would be ebi katsu and, er, the chicken curry with the rice. So, the katsu\u2019s actually, literally just fried prawns. So, er, it\u2019s got a nice, a nice coating on the outside and on the inside, when you bit into it\u2019s quite flavourful. Then, er, the actual chicken curry is just rice underneath it all and it\u2019s covered by quite a few vegetables, a few sauces and the actual chicken, you know, mixed in a curry sauce. So then yeah, that\u2019s pretty much my favourite, yeah. It\u2019s a recent one as well. <new>Yeah, recent discovery.<new>Erm, what was my favourite restaurant? I don\u2019t know, I, I like a range of things but a guaranteed good meal you could get is a  <restaurant2> , hundred percent. Nothing can go wrong. So yeah, I would say  <restaurant2>  was my favourite before.<new>Er, so I used to be a half chicken, peri chips guy. But I recently transformed into a five chicken wings and peri chips and garlic bread. Yeah.<new>Er, I think, er, er, when I was in  <country1>  and, er, my grandma made me one of our traditional foods. It\u2019s called  <dish1> ,  <SPELLS_OUT_DISH1> . So, er, she made it herself, personally and, er, it was just quite nice, really, to have such a elderly person cooking you such a traditional meal as you\u2019re abroad as well. So, it all just came together quite nicely, actually. <new>Yeah. Yeah, I do. So, it\u2019s like a doughy, it\u2019s like, it\u2019s a circle and it\u2019s like a doughy type thing so you can literally just, er, pick it up with your hands. And you eat it with a sort of, erm, soup. So, you literally put it in the middle of the bowl and then you pour the soup around it and usually, depending on the type of soup it is, it might have different meats or fishes. So, you could have a fish soup or a meat soup. I usually prefer the, the meat soups. So, erm, you could have a meat soup one with the  <dish1>  and er, yeah. And how you make it is that it\u2019s water mixed with the powder. So, it starts in a box and you just build the water up, pour the powder in and then just, you know, mix that together. And then the actual soup is a separate thing altogether. And depending on what type you\u2019re making, it can take quite a while because it\u2019s, you know, really advanced but,  <misc> . But, erm, yeah. I don\u2019t know how to make the soup  <laugh> . But I do know how to make the, the actual  <dish1>  so, yeah, that\u2019s about it."]}

Erm, I'm not really sure I have one but, mm, I\u2019ve recently got into, erm, Chinese food recently, recently. But erm, what\u2019s my favourite cuisine? I don\u2019t really have one, I\u2019ll just I like a mixture of things.<new>Erm, I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just quite different and it\u2019s not the typical, erm, yeah, potatoes or steak or fries or whatever. It\u2019s just a different sort of, like a whole different country, different culture, different taste, different flavours. So, but, erm, something like dumplings, you wouldn\u2019t necessarily have it on a normal day in your house. So, if I had that. And then yeah, you could go to the basic stuff like, er, egg fried rice or chicken fried rice, king prawn fried rice but, yeah, just different culture, I\u2019d say.<new>Oh, my favourite dish to cook. Erm, I mean, I can cook but I wouldn\u2019t say I'm the  <chef>  of the house  <laugh> . So, there\u2019s not much of a, a range to pick from. But erm, I would say, I can make my own roasts quite well, actually, er.<new>Yeah.<new><laugh> , okay. So, erm, it starts by getting your King Edward potatoes in. They usually have a bit of a red tint to them on the outside. So, then you just wash the potatoes, peel them, er, put a bit of salt, a bit of herbs on them, you know, cut them up, er, mix it all together. Then that\u2019s the potatoes done. And a trick my mum taught me is that you can boil the potatoes for a bit before you put them in the oven, which makes them all fluffy and actually cooks them quicker. So yeah, you season it all up and then I actually boil it. Then you put it into the oven and then that\u2019s the potatoes done. Then you get the sausages out of the pack, er, place it on a tray on the foil, put it inside the oven. Then the gravy, it\u2019s, it looks simple but it\u2019s actually kind of hard to make because if you get it too thick, like you\u2019re just eating slob. And if it\u2019s too thin, it\u2019s just water. So, you\u2019ve just got to, as you\u2019re pouring in the hot water, pour in the gra-, the granules at the same time and mix it consistently, otherwise, if you get lumps or it gets all thin, it\u2019s not really going to taste the best. So, whilst you\u2019re doing all of that, the ovens and the sausages are inside. So, erm, really and truly, when you\u2019re making the gravy, you\u2019re practically done. And then, obviously, you\u2019re boiling up all the carrots, the broccolis and then you plate up and you\u2019re done.", "We\u2019ve got a as WhatsApp group for the <module> essay.

I'm writing this email on behalf of us all in regards to the maintenance of the house.<nl><nl>Firstly, the fridge has been a recurring problem. This is because from day one it has always been difficult to fully close it - partly due to the design of the cupboard door and the fact that the freezer isn\u2019t working properly and as a result the ice builds up and doesn\u2019t allow it to close. This further prevents the fridge from closing properly in addition to the cupboard design door. This ongoing issue has resulted in numerous amounts of food not being kept properly and the unfortunate throwing away of them. We are all experiencing hard times as we attempt to continue living with COVID19, therefore the continuous cycle of buying food and it going off due to a dysfucntional and ineffective fridge makes these times just that much harder.<nl><nl>A contractor was sent out once and the service he provided was not good enough as this is still a very important issue - if not the most important as it directly effects our health and safety.<nl><nl>Another issue in the kitchen is that one of the lower cabinet doors has come off. I believe the inside components have snapped and the repair will require new parts.<nl><nl>The last of the issues in the kitchen is the metal wall section behind the sink. The bottom part of it has opened and essentially began to peel off. This also needs to be fixed because if its allowed to continue peeling the wall behind it will start to get wet from the sink and cause further damage to the property.<nl><nl>In line with maintenance requests, it has also been brought to my attention that the top floor tenant is extremely unhappy with the mattress she is having to use as she says all she can feel is the springs within it. This causes severe joint and shoulder pain - again this is important as it has a direct impact on her health. If this could be replaced it would be most helpful, as we are timely paying tenants who don\u2019t believe this to be an unjust request.<nl><nl>I did contact the <business> property management mobile contact number ending 152, I was directed to report all maintenance issues through property file. However, we were not given access to this platform and so can\u2019t use it.

And I can just tell by the way the\u2026 okay, so the background is white as well, and the, the white female\u2019s standing up and almost bending over, and er, I can see it\u2019s a sort of teacher and student relationship. And they\u2019re both, you know, quite smiling a bit, so, erm. She\u2019s also, the teacher\u2019s also rolled their sleeves up, and she\u2019s got a black hairband on her right wrist, and she\u2019s let her blonde hair down. And erm, the student is sitting in the chair with her braids, and she\u2019s smiling quite a bit with her teeth showing as well. And erm, she\u2019s using her right hand to touch her chest, so I think they\u2019re just sharing a moment. So that\u2019s image one. And erm,  <misc>  in image two, there\u2019s a white background with a sort of uni, er, couch setup. And there\u2019s two males; er, one who\u2019s got a black earring in his left ear, and er, another who\u2019s also wearing a red, er, red shirt over a white, er, t-shirt. And they\u2019re both, er, sitting behind a Mac, and they\u2019re just looking at the computer. So I think they might be computing students or some type of technology involved in their, er, degrees also. Erm, the laptop\u2019s actually on a black sort of coffee table. And erm, yeah, it just looks like they\u2019re students on the same sort of course and, you know, just doing a bit of work together. So that\u2019s image two.
